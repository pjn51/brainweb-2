# Discussion
- Things will be weird at first
- Have a running document of questions and things that don't make sense
- Measurement and tools team run by Maitreyi
	- Divided into "measurement" and "tools"
	- Syed is the team lead for the tooling team. This includes full stack devs, software engineers, analytics. 
	- Josh, Lynn, and me are on analytics, Logan and Atsushi are on tooling side.
	- Syed also has an ops team that reports to him. 
- Core values for my position
	- Continuous learning
	- Ownership
	- Deliver results consistently
		- Our work is very impactful, we have to trust the results that we present
	- Collaborate and be reliable
		- The sole purpose is to collab with the product teams
	- Know your data and tools
	- Organizational impact
- Mission statement
	- Identify and build datasets and tetrics to enhance decision making for prod quality an dpartmer with product, data sci, enginereering teams to drive change. Leverage tech and data to empower job seeker ops
- Rubric
	- L1 is TA (technical analyst). That's me.
	- L2 is senior analyst
	- L3 is lead TA
	- I should take a look at is
	- Review cycle every six months based on this rubric
	- Having impact can also be taken into account outside of this rubric
- Ratings
	- Ratings are from 1 to 5. 3 is "at level" where you're meeting expectations. 5 is "next level."This correlates with quarterly bonuses (ev three months)
	- 3: 10% bonus
	- 4: 15% bonus
	- 5: 20% bonus
- They compare position within pay band with the ratings, and want these two metrics to align. If I'm paid more, I need to get a better score and vice versa.
- Best practices
	- Provide PTO notice two weeks in advance. Check team calendar before scheduling PTO requests. He usually approves all requests, but you have to do your work. Those who take off lots of time are de-prioritized below those who take less time off, such that there are always workers covering. 
	- Follow OOO protocol (send auto email notifications, update calendars, slack, JIRA)
- If it's less than 3 hours, don't submit pto, just block your time out on the calendar
