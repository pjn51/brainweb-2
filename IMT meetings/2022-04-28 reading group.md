[[The State and Revolution (1917)#3 Experience of the Paris Commune of 1871 Marx's Analysis]]
# ✅ Topics to discuss
- [x] What does Lenin mean by smashing the state apparatus?

# ✏️ Notes
- What position did Marx take on the Paris Commune? How should this influence the approach we take to other revolutions?
	- Advised against it, but supported it after it began. Analyzed it and learned from it. 
- What for Lenin is the significance of Marx' reference to the “people's revolution”? How did this relate to the tasks of the Russian Revolution?
	- A peoples' revolution is one in which the masses play a serious role. 
- Why did the Paris Commune fail?
	- Lack of unity of urban and rural masses
	- Lack of willingness to fight until the end
- Why does Lenin say, “the transition from capitalism to socialism is impossible without a certain “reversion” to “primitive” democracy?
	- Bourgeois democrats view the movement from direct democracy to representative democracy as the final ascendancy, but we view the movement from direct to representational democracy as a dialecticial progression upward. 
- What is the difference between parliamentarism and workers' democracy?
- Why is the immediate abolition of all bureaucracy “out of the question?"
