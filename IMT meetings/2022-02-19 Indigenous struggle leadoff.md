# Leadoff on the indigenous struggle in Canada
A portion of [[2022-02 Marxist Winter School]]

---
I arrived late to this session. The speaker, Laine Sheldon-Houle, explained that [[White workers don't benefit from racism]], extending the same argument to the oppression of Natives in [[Canada]]. He goes on to criticize the whole idea of "settler-colonialism" expressed along the lines of [[Settlers - The Mythology of the White Proletariat (1983)]]. 

He argues that since Indigenous people only represent 5% of the Canadian population, they require allies.
