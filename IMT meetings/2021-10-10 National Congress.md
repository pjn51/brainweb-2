# Bolshevism in the 2020s (Antonio Balmer)
- The past of the IMT
	- Started with one person in Fargo, ND
	- 15 years from 1 to 100
	- 5 years from 100 to 200
	- 1 year from 200 to 300
	- Less than a year to reach 400
- Need to become more representative
	- 60% of Black Americans have a positive view of socialism, we must engage with them!

# Organizational resolution discussion
See [[IMT US Organizational Resolution (2021)]]
- Johnathan (PHX)
- Bryce (NYC)
	- Gen Z spends 4.5 hours daily on social media, need to use those tools!
- Brandon (PHL)
	- Must develop clarity on the indigenous struggle in the [[USA]] before putting demands forward
	- We must develop this clarity soon
- Kyle (STL)
	- [[DSA]] approach of "doing the work" vs ours
	- We should conduct work *wherever* possible
- Alex (Madison)
	- We shouldn't treat any working class community as exterior
	- We can't expect to perfectly mirror the demographics of society
	- The most oppressed have less time for organizing, and are less politically engaged
	- We can see this in how women in the Russian revolution were first less active in the movement, but surged to the forefront at the critical moment
	- BLM failed to mobilize the majority of the Black community due to political confusion and lack of concrete demands
- Emilia (NYC)
	- Reformist bureaucrats have a personal interest in fighting us
	- They will weaponize [[identity politics]] against us
- Charlie (STL)
	- Agrees with Brandon's intervention
	- Supports P7 as a way to urge the writing of articles and organization-wide discussion
	- Advocates a new book on US history to improve on [[Marxism and the USA (2005)]]
- Heim (?)
	- We should be wary of the stellar rise and ultimate collapse of [[CPUSA]]
	- It's our responsibility to avoid this by understanding theory and moving into leadership roles within the IMT
- Manny (PBH)
	- Support of P8
		- Workers think of wages in terms of hourly pay
		- Workers may confuse our "$1000 per week" demand as an UBI
	- Ability to diversify will be led by theoretical knowledge, not an attempt to target specific racial groups
- Stanton (PHL)
	- Need to double down on theory
	- Need to learn the method of Marxism to consolidate our forces
- Erica (PHX)
	- Tips to recruit women
	- Need to avoid a lecturing style of discussion
	- Need to avoid condescending
	- Need for a nuanced position on feminism
- Nick (PHX)
- Tom (NYC)
	- Program is a condensed tool for recruitment and agitation
	- No need to elaborate *all* our ideas on every issue
	- We must think clearly about what work we should engage in
	- We can't build a mass tendency without a [[cadre]] base, and we can't build a party without a mass tendency
- Joe (NJ)

# Auditors' report
- CC provides highest financial oversight
- They aren't accountants, they just provide additional layer of transparency and oversight
- They have full open access to the books from 2018-2021
- Overall, finances are being kept in a professional manner
- Biggest expenses go to full-time comrades' wages
	- Went from 4 to 12 full-timers this year
	- Budget percentages sent to wages actually went down in 2019, and went up in 2020
	- COLAs have been added to the budget for salaries
- Rent and travel are other expenses
- Technical items on the budget 
	- Justified but expensive
- Income
	- Marxist Books is expanding, and self-sustaining
	- Primary income is from member dues and FF contributions
	- Average member contributions went up in 2020, has gone down in 2021
		- Highlights importance of dues drive in the branches
- Methods of keeping the books
	- Will need continued emphasis and improvement as we grow
	- We will need more financial staff
- Venmo is still ideal for dues collection, as long as we stay below $5,000 weekly transfers
	- Sales tax issues are on the horizon
	- Send memos seperately

# Working in the labor movement (Tom Trottier)
- 1934-38: labor movement more than tripled unionization numbers
- Used plant occupations, mass picketing, and mass demonstrations of all kinds
- This was cut across by [[WW2]], which removed 12 million young workers
- In 1946, there was a huge wave of struggle
- After WW2, the boom softened the struggle to some extent. That and the red scare allowed a purge of the left in the [[unions]]
- Rightwing labor leadership allowed the capitalists to escape with minor reforms
- The 73-76 recession forced the capitalists to remove the reforms that had quieted the struggle
- Most strikes ended in defeat, workers drew pessimistic conclusions
- Class struggle intensified, but the reformist leadership failed to take advantage of the situation
- Work stoppages dropped in the 80s, and bottomed out in the 2000s
- In 2009, there were only 5 major work stoppages, compared to many hundreds throughout earlier decades. 
- This trend is reversing slowly
- Many wildcat strikes, and strikes by non-unionized labor
- Multiple recent heroic defeats of the workers demonstrate willingness to fight, lack of leadership
- Union opposition in the UAW...
	- Some oppositionists want direct election of leaders instead of election at a convention
	- Not so fast! Direct elections require candidates to travel around the country, raise their profile, and make themselves known
- We need numbers to build oppositions to the union leadership! We need cadre in the union locals!
- Marxists working in the trade unions must begin with solid branches to be effective militants, or else they risk becoming trade unionists who consider themselves Marxists
- Don't seem like a know-it-all when you engage with coworkers
- Show seriousness when it comes to work, so that management has no cards to play against you. This will help you gain the trust and confidence of coworkers
- We don't need to start off with strong talk, we can work on coworkers over time
- Whenever you take a position, discuss with the organization beforehand, and we can judge on a case-by-case basis
- If not in a union, we can provide strike support by going to the picket line, labor rallies, and selling the paper to workers

# Arman's report on the Marathon strike
- Issuing material aid to the union can help get a foot in the door
- Need for consistency, mild in manner + bold in content
- Don't hide political stances, but don't push as agressively as during a cold sale

# Student work (Stanton from PHL)
- Youth = way to the workers
- 35 million youth have a favorable view of communism
- Student work in the USA is behind the work of other countries
- Alien class ideas are concentrated on campuses
- Interest peaks during the first month of the school year, and dips according to test schedules. 
- Temple University in Philadelphia
	- 100+ attendees at a student meeting
	- Result of five years of patient work
	- Began when PHL had three comrades
	- Three years of holding on by the fingernails
	- Established a healthy base of workers
	- Finally having a cadre inside the university made a huge difference
	- During a week of back-to-back activity...
		- 300 contacts
		- $700 in sales
	- Dilligent contact follow up made a good difference, with those who *actually showed up* to the first meeting targeted for one-on-ones. 
- Bold ideas sell to the youth
- Student club meetings are *not* branch meetings, and have Marxists in the minority. Expect alien class ideas
- Student clubs provide glimpses into what issues the comrades need to study!

# Working in the DSA (Nick B from PHX)
- Pessimism of the [[DSA]]
- Size of the DSA
	- 92,000 official members
	- Many inactive
	- Still a big deal!
- Opportunities for the IMT
	- We can engage with some members
	- 27% identify as [[communism|communist]]
	- 30% identify as [[Marxism|Marxists]]
- Risks for the IMT
	- Bureaucratic targeting
	- [[COVID-19]] has limited the work (holding in-person meetings can actually *attract* some additional people)
- PHX DSA and the IMT
	- Able to draw a wide crowd for a post-Bernie discussion 
	- They started this work with four members (they don't advise this!)
	- They eventually gained the majority of the executive commitee
	- Using this, they put a resolution to the national DSA
	- They faced harassment and bullying
- Working *around* DSA
	- Asking DSA members to attend IMT meetings
	- Attending DSA-sponsored events
- Working *in* DSA
	- Running political education committees
	- Running executive committees
- Working *with* DSA
	- PHX co-hosted a meeting, and tabled next to the DSA
- Considerations
	- Communicate with branch leadership and CC members
	- Prepare comrades ahead of time
	- Don't hide allegiance to the IMT
