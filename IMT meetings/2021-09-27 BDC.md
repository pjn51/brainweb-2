	- 1,800 at UW who are favorable towards communism
	- Orienting to the future rather than the past or the present
	- Orienting to the growth that will meet us very soon
	- As many branches at this National Congress as we had delegates at the last one
	- Creating the organizational structures that can contain ten times the members without breaking

# ðŸ“¥ Organizational point: members' handbook part V (my leadoff)
- The importance of regular, organized public activity
	- We are not a talking shop
	- "Do we get more out of this intervention than we put in?"
	- How to measure success

- Leafleting
	- High foot traffic areas
	- Flyer designed based on intervention
	- Engage in discussion
- Paper sales
	- "The basic unit for building the organization is two comrades selling the paper."
	- Must be a collective effort in the branch, but even an at-large comrade can form a branch this way
- Tabling
	- Paper sale + other items + banner
	- Experiment with time and place
- Other organizations' events
	- Build on, don't leech of other organizations
	- If planning to intervene, advertise for the event and attempt to help organize
	- Keep friendly relations with organizers
	- Example of SAlt ralles
- Picket lines
	- Need for careful approach
	- Win confidence through active participation, not through lecturing or elitism
	- See example of the Marathon oil workers strike that comrades intervened in
- Our own public events
	- The most advanced form of public activity
	- Requires careful planning (location, speakers, need for sound system, etc)

	- The national organization has a Control Commission to investigate all uncomradely behavior
	- Basic thrust is that sunlight is the best disinfectant
	- More info available in the members handbook appendix on Norms of conduct
- Importance of contact work and recruitment
	- External growth is an *essential* part of building a Bolshevik organization
	- We seek to gather and weld together the most advanced workers and youth
	- This requires that people actually know we exist
	- Not on a mission to argue or change minds
	- Seeking to gather those who agree and want to become involved

	- 3% of our contacts have become members in the last 6 months, 2 out of around 70 people
