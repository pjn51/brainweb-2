Martin says that the Cuban revolution is a confirmation of the theory of [[permanent revolution]], since the revolutionaries were forced to move against [[capitalism]] in order to secure the victory of what were originally bourgeois democratic aims. 

However, he says there are forces within [[Cuba]] seeking to move towards the model that [[China]] has adopted, representing a return to capitalism. 

## A Brief History
In 1958, Martin outlines how Batista attempted to stall revolution by stepping down and appointing Cantillo as dictator. However, he says this ruse didn't work. The July 26 Movement (M-26J) called for a general strike in response. 

By the end of the day, the author explains that government troops had surrendered under the pressure of the strike and rebels who had taken key positions in Havana. 

Martin says that on January 8th, [[Castro]] entered the city and the new government of Urrutia took power with Cardona as prime minister. Three years later, he says capitalism would be abolished in the country. 

## Fifty Years Later
The author claims that the bourgeois machine of historical revisionism has rewritten these events. He says newspapers love to publish the views of those who had some ties with the revolution, but broke with it as soon as it began to challenge capitalism. Reflective of this, he says they portray that *authoritarianism* took hold of the movement which at first was noble. 

Martin criticizes the bourgeois media for claiming that the failure of "communism" has been demonstrated by the lack of progress in Cuba from 1959 to today. He accuses them of seeking to compare Cuban's curtailment of human rights with other Latin American countries, papering over the fact that nearly every neighbor has a terrible record of exploitation, coups, and death squads in some cases. 

In fact, Martin says Cuba compares well with neighbors, having a higher life expectancy than Haiti and [[Brazil]], and nearly matching the US. He explains that Cuba even has a lower infant mortality rate than the [[USA]]. 

This stands in stark contrast with the situation in the 50s. Batista's Cuba was a playground for the [[USA|American]] bourgeoisie while only 15% of the houses in the city had a bathroom, and only 1% in the rest of the country. 

Less than 30,000 landowners controlled 70% of all arable land, while over 40% of the population didn't have stable work. 

If it had not been for the redistribution of property along more logical lines after the revolution, Cuba today would be more like Haiti. 

## The Character of the Revolution
The revolution was fundamentally a bourgeois democratic one. While there were those in the movement's leadership that considered themseves socialists or communists, we can see from the movement's goals and the speeches given by its leaders that they did not raise the abolition of capitalism as a central demand. 

The first president after the revolution, Urrutia, was a conservative judge who was an anti-communist. The prime minister was a lawyer with no revolutionary background. 

However, even the narrower program of a bourgeois revolution couldn't be accomplished without butting heads with the imperialist US interest in the island. We can see in the development of the revolution between 59 and 62 that this was the case. 

In [[The Permanent Revolution (1931)]], Trotksy explains his theory of Permanent Revolution, which he based on the experience of the [[Russia|Russian revolution]]. He explained that during the epoch of [[imperialism]], the weak capitalist classes in backwards countries cannot solve the problems that the bourgeois revolution attempts to solve. These problems are agrarian reform and liberation from imperialist domination.

The attempt to solve these problems without breaking from the national bourgeoisie and capitalism itself proved impossible for Cuba. As the government began to take measures to redistribute agrarian land, more and more elements of the bourgeois moved over to the counter-revolutionary camp. 

As this happened, the more radical elements of the revolutionary leadership took power. They continued to pass agrarian reform bills, which further accelerated this process. The workers and [[peasantry]] became more and more supportive of this stage of the revolution as they saw changes being made despite bourgeois opposition. 

The lowering of rents, tarrifs, and utility bills showed the masses that the revolutionary government, now led by [[Castro]], was on their side. Armed militias of workers and peasants began to form in order to defend these gains from the counter-revolution, which now counted sections of the former military among its ranks. 

The revolution aquired an increasingly radical character as a series of strikes and counter-strikes, provocations, and battles occured between the forces of revolution and counter-revolution. In 1960, Cuba nationalized all foreign companies and banks, as Fidel declared the socialist character of the revolution. By 1961, capitalism had been effectively snuffed out. 

Then came the Bay of Pigs invasion in 61. 

These events contain an important lesson. The fundamental problems that were solved by the bourgeois revolutions can no longer be solved in that way. In order to achieve even the limited forms of national liberation that those revolutions brought, the revolution must break with capitalism and with the capitalists. 

## The First Decade, Debates and Conflicts
By breaking with capitalism, Cuba was propelled in the direction of the USSR. However, the USSR in the 60s was a contradictory state. The ruling bureaucracy was quite conservative, and even counter-revolutionary in outlook. The foreign policy of the USSR was based on peaceful co-existance with the capitalists, a far cry from the revolutionary internationalism of [[Lenin]] and [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]]. 

[[Stalinism]] had a negative effect on the Cuban Communist Party, leading them astray before the revolution. This party, later renamed the Peoples' Socialist Party, often found itself to the right of Castro as he broke with capitalism. 

Fidel and Che thought of the Cuban revolution as part of the Latin American revolution against imperialism. However, the USSR disagreed. This led to conflict, and Stalinists were actually purged from the revolutionary organizations a few times throughout the 60s. 

The Cuban revolutionaries didn't have to totally rely on the USSR, since they had their own base of support among the workers and peasants. This allowed them to resist the negative influences of the USSR. 

The rising generation that lived through the Cuban revolution tended to reject [[Stalinism]]. Havana University rejected the standard Marxist curriculum provided by the USSR, instead formulating their own program based more honestly on the works of [[Marx]], [[Engels]], and Lenin. Publications were started that openly challenged the Soviet conception of Marxism. 

In the planning of Cuba, there was also resistance to the will of the bureaucracy. Che defended the need for central planning against the Stalinists who called for market mechanisms to be introduced. 

Unfortunately, this period came to an end in the 70s. Che failed to spread the revolution to Cuba's neighbors, and the Cuban sugar cane crop failed as well. This led to total dependence of Cuba upon the USSR for aid, and therefore the influence of Stalinism grew in all areas. 

## Cuba Resists the Fall of the USSR
Despite this, the Cuban revolution survived. At the end of the 80s, with the impending collapse of the USSR, the revolution's vitality and roots among the masses held it strong. 

The economic situation was grim. Up until the collapse, 63% of Cuba's food came from the USSR, and 80% of Cuba's exports went there. All of this changed overnight. 

As a result, Cuban [[GDP]] collapsed by 35% and exports fell by 79%. 

The human cost of this was astronomical. There were blackouts, lack of food, lack of medicine, and fuel was impossible to come by. All this while the world ruling class blared that socialism had failed, from every outlet they had. 

Thanks to the Cuban Communist Party, which actually resisted capitalist restoration (in stark contrast to the USSR's ruling party), the spirit of struggle was reborn in Cuba. Despite the hardships, the Cuban people defended their gains and refused to return to capitalism. 

## The Cuban Economy in the World Market
At the same time, concessions to capitalism were made. They couldn't be avoided, but became contradictions within Cuba, and threats to the planned economy. 

Foreign investment was allowed, tourism was promoted, small peasant cooperatives were set up. A small [[petty bourgeoisie]] was allowed to develop. 

Cuba's position in the world economy was at the very bottom. Rich in raw materials but without an industrial base, Cuba was being taken advantage of. 

All of these forces push a country towards capitalism. But luckily, in 2003 the Cuban government turned towards re-centralization. The decisive factor is still the weakness of the economy. It's still based on income from tourism, the export of doctors, and raw materials. 

Tourism creates lots of contradictions. While tourists being hard [[currency]], this inflates the value of [[labor]] that is adjacent to tourism, such as taxi drivers. If taxi drivers are able to make more real money than construction workers or doctors, this causes a movement of the labor market away from those necessary professions. 

These forces also cause an ideological crisis, where as more and more people have to turn to illegal or semi-legal means to survive, the collective spirit is lost and individualism becomes more and more prevalent. 

## The World Revolution, the Only Soluction to the Problems of the Cuban Revolution
The only real solution to Cuba's problems is a way to rely on its neighbors. And the only way that would happen is through the spreading of revolution. 

This is the second half of Trotsky's equation in [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]]. Trotsky said that the revolution begins on the national arena, it unfolds on the international arena, and is completed on the world arena. 

The development of the revolution in [[Venezuela]] has provided much needed support to Cuba, even though capitalism still holds power there. 

Therefore, the foreign policy of Cuba should be firmly internationalist, recognizing that the US and other capitalist powers will seek to destroy Cuba wether or not Cuba seeks to spread revolution. 

## The Struggle Against Bureaucracy and Corruption
There are also internal threats to the revolution. Castro warned in 2005 against the dangers of bureaucracy and corruption within the Party. In any country with limited resources, corruption is bound to arise. The only way to fight against this trend is through the use of workers' democracy. 

When the workers don't feel that they're in charge of decision making, the seeds of demoralization and scepticism are sown. 

The replacement of Fidel by Raul Castro was a referendum on socialism in general. It demonstrated the support that still exists for socialism, but also pointed to the threats that socialist construction faces in Cuba. The changes that really resulted from this were very minor, and only really benefited those who have access to foreign currency. This only increased inequality. 

## Cuba- Towards the Chinese Way?
It's clear that the leadesrhip of Cuba tends to prioritize administrative solutions to political problems. The international media has speculated as to whether Raul Castro will continue this trend by moving towards China's route back to capitalism. 

In offical Cuban media, the emphasis is made that Cuba is not China, and solutions cannot be copied. However, Cuban economists are proposing similar measures for Cuba. 

If these measures were introduced, they would place Cuba firmly on the path back to capitalism. 

## Self-Management?
Some have proposed a decentralized system of self-management as a solution. These proposals would transfer ownership of small and medium firms directly to the workers. This is similar to the system that emerged in [[Yugoslavia]], which led to the economic collapse of that country and to its breaking up. 

This method of economic organization leads to the development of regionalism and individualism instead of collectivism. It pits workers against one another for control of the market, and leads to firms externalizing costs onto society, such as pollution. 

Furthermore, firms that provide useful services but don't turn a profit are abandoned, leading to serious long-term problems. 

The linking of wages to profits would force the workers to exploit themselves, and follow all the whims of the market, just as the bosses must under capitalism. 

## Ideological Rearming of the Cuban Revolution
There is a layer of Cuban society looking for a left-wing alternative to these two solutions. Some, like Cuban writer Desiderio Navarro, have come out against both so-called solutions. 

There are youth organizations in Cuba that study the Bolsheviks, and affirm the revolutionary character of Marxism. This is vital to provide a counter-weight to the forces of Stalinism and [[reformism]] in Cuba. 

The international situation is favorable to the Cuban revolution. Across the continent, revolution is making progress.
