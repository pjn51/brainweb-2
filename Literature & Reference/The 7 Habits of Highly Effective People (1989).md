# Paradigms and principles
## Inside-out
The author begins by describing his idea of paradigms. He says that a paradigm is a map of meaning that we overlay on top of reality, allowing us to get to where we want to go. He argues that before our determination and perserverence can move us in the right direction, we need to know what the right direction is, and in order to do that, we have to have the correct paradigm for the situation.

Covey also discusses the differences between the different systems of [[ethics]] that he sees in the world. He contrasts the *personality ethic,* which he describes as surface-level skill in getting what we want out of a specific relationship or conversation, with the *character ethic,* which involves deeper statements about who we are as people, not the social or interpersonal skills that we have. 

Covey moves on to the idea of *principles.* He says that the character ethic is based on the idea that there are trans-historical natural laws of social organization that cannot be broken. He includes fairness, honesty, human dignity, and other things in this category. 

Personally, I think Covey is going too far with his assertion that these things are trans-historical and unbreakable. For example, Covey says that "it is impossible for us to break the law. We can only break ourselves against the law." He goes on to say that a gang of thieves are not living in accordance with the law of fairness. How can they break this so-called natural law that he compares to gravity? Furthermore, there are countless examples of people breaking the laws of fairness and human dignity, and going on to lead happy and successful lives. For instance, warlords and kings who stole from their people every day, and lived long, comfortable lives. 

Covey cautions against the apparent shortcut of the personality ethic, saying that over time, it weakens our ability to solve our own problems by encouraging us to rely on band-aids and external solutions to our internal issues. He explains that this book follows an "inside-out" approach, where we will seek to resolve problems by turning inward, and examining our own character, goals, and motivation before assuming that a solution to the issue can be found outside of ourselves. He applies this idea to an example of a failing marriage, labor disputes, and the social crises of the 90s, including [[South Africa]] and [[Ireland]]. 

To me, this seems like it has some merit, but is pushed way too far. I agree that internal factors are important, but I would say that we have to apply [[dialectics]] here. There is a dialectical push and pull between our internal factors (Covey would call them our paradigms) and the external factors of other people and the material world. Because we have far more control over internal factors than we do other people and the rest of the universe, it makes sense to look first to adjusting the internal forces before relying on a changed external world to provide a solution. However, Covey applies this concept rigidly. He appears to think that *all* problems can be solved by this approach, when that is absolutely false. For example, the conflict between workers and management cannot be solved by just "establishing a basis of trust," as Covey recommends. There are material external forces that move workers and owners into conflict with one another, and no paradigm shift can possibly change this relationship. For a more personal example, if a marriage is going badly because one person cheated on another person, no paradigm shift on the part of the victim is needed - the cheater is the one who must change if the marriage is to continue. Of course, this presumes that the cheating was entirely due to a character flaw in the cheater, but I digress. 

## The 7 habits - an overview
Covey defines a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. By this, he means that in order to form a habit, we have to *know* what we want to do or achieve, we have to have the *skill* to actually do the habit, and we have to have the *desire* to create the habit. 

Covey defines the *maturity continuum,* which he says is what we seek to travel along. He says that this continuum starts at dependence, travels through independence, and arrives at interdependence. When we are infants, he explains, we are totally dependent, and upon growing up, we become first independent of others, and then realize that the measure of our maturity is not independence, but recognizing that it is our bonds with others that are valuable. Finally, he says, we arrive at the conclusion that the world is governed by interrelated systems and many connections that we cannot, and should not seek to, live outside of. 

Because of this continuum, Covey has placed the first three habits in the realm of *private victories,* which deal with becoming independent. He says that dependent people cannot skip the stage of independence before moving on to interdependence. 

Covey defines effectiveness as a function of production and production capacity. He encourages us to keep P and PC in balance in order to optimize P over the long run. For example, Covey discusses how he had a lawn mower that he never maintained, causing it to break down. Because Covey didn't invest in maintaining the production capacity of the lawn mower, choosing to only care about the production of cut lawns, he eventually lost the production completely.
