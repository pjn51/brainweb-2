# Part one: the origin of money
## Primitive communism
Booth describes [[primitive communism]] as a society where production was based on need rather than exchange, but on a foundation of generalized scarcity (p.3). 

## The rise of money
Booth quotes [[Engels]], who says that the rise of private property led to exchange between individuals and to [[commodities|commodity]] production generally. He continues, saying that this led to a loss of control over the economic forces of society (p.4). I think this is an interesting point. In the marketplace, individual producers lose the ability to control what their commodities are used for. A brick manufacturer has no say in what buildings are built, for instance. 

Booth clarifies that the development of exchange begins, not within a community, but between communities, and only later infects the internal relations of each group (p.4). I think this is an important idea: [[Trade first developed between groups, not within them]]. 

Booth explains that [[currency|money]] is a universal commodity that acts as a metric to which other commodities are compared, facilitating trade over long distances (p.4). 

## Credit money
Booth outlines how some theorize that money functions as a system of credits and debts, and plays the role of an account ledger for society. He explains that while this theory has positive points to it, it is often based on an incorrect argument against the existence of a "barter economy." Booth says that indeed there never was a barter economy, but not because of an elaborate system of credit which these thinkers propose, but because barter developed *between* groups, rather than *within* them (p.7). 

# Part two: value and social relations
## The labor theory of value
Booth begins this chapter by asking what money really is. He argues that money is both a universal commodity which acts as a benchmark between other commodities, and it's a unit of account that balances credits and debts. He explains that both roles are united by the concept of *[[value]],* and that this poses another question as to the nature of value (p.9). 

In order to deal with this question, Booth explains, we need to break value down into its subcategories of use-value and exchange-value. He explains that as commodity production develops, exchange-value begins to dominate use-value in importance, and that the use of the word "value" generally deals with exchange-value (p.10). 

Booth describes how [[Marx]] attempted to investigate value. He says that the latter argued since commodities can be exchanged for one another, they must have one feature in common - and labor is the only candidate. Therefore, he continues, value must be determined by the relative quantity of labor that is put into the production of a commodity. In other words, [[Labor creates value]]. However, Booth explains, we have to do a bit of aggregation to arrive at a useful model of value-creation. He says that since commodity exchange alienates the producer from the consumer, we have to look at the *average socially necessary* labor that goes into the production of a commodity (p.10-11). This makes sense, and defeats a common counter-argument of the [[labor theory of value]]. Some say that if labor creates value, then a slower worker must create more value than a faster one - an absurdity. Marx would respond that indeed, of workers *on average* were slower, the commodities they produce would have a higher exchange value. But any individual worker who was slower than average would just be a bad worker, and would create less value than a faster-than-average one. [[Value is detemined by socially average labor-time]]. 

Because, Booth continues, the law of value is related to this aggregation of labor time, the law of value only emerges when commodity production and exchange is generalized (p.11). 

## Social relations and alienation
Booth explains that the money relation actually hides a social relation behind it. He says that these social relations are in turn backed up by the [[state]] enforcement of contracts and property relations (p.12). 

The author also says that the domination of the money relation represents the final [[alienation]] of the worker from their labor. He tells us that the worker is no longer producing things for their own consumption, but rather for money, which represents the abstracted value of their production (p.13). This is the economic reason for why [[Capitalism is alienating]]. 

## The enigma of profit
Booth begins to explain that [[The commodity produciton circuit moves from C-M-C to M-C-M]] as commodity production matures. He says that initially, commodities are produced, transformed into money, and then exchanged for other commodities, which we can represent as $C-M-C$. Then, he continues, the circuit reverses, becoming a $M-C-M'$ circuit, as commodities are only purchased in order to sell them for an additional and greater sum of money,  $M'$ . Furthermore, he explains that money lenders and financiers attempt to jump past commodity purchasing altogether, attempting to create a $M-M'$ circuit. Booth says that this is a fundamentally parasitic cycle, as only the production of commodities increases the wealth of society (p.14).

Booth now answers the fundamental question as to the source of profit. He says that profit comes from the [[surplus value]] created by [[labor|labor power]], rather than from the exchange of commodities (p.15). 

Booth concludes this chapter by discussing the relationship between the value of labor power and the prevailing wages paid to the worker. He argues that since society must replace the workers from day to day, there is an objective minimum price of labor power that allows for the sustinance of the worker and the raising of the next generation. He says that this amount varies from time to time, and from place to place, and depends on what the expectation of the standard of living is in a given society. Therefore, Booth explains, the value of labor power is dependent on the class struggle between worker and owner (p.16). 

# Part three: the rise of the bankers
## The growth of finance
Booth explains that the basic forms of the modern banking system - accounting and loans - were present in ancient society. However, he says, they were subordinated to the whims of the feudal lords and kings, who used their monopoly position as minters of the currency to profit. Booth outlines how the monarch would engage in a process known as *seigniorage* - "changing the nominal value of the coins in circulation and pocketing the difference" (p. 18). I'm a little unclear as to what this process entailed. 

In order to get out from under the thumb of the aristocracy, the author continues, the merchant class began circumventing the former. These merchant houses, he says, dealt with tradesmen directly, creating an international system of IOUs and payments (p.19). 

According to the author, here is where we enter into the era of state debt - an idea which he says makes little rational sense. If the state needs money, Booth argues, it would be more straightforward to get it through taxation. However, he notes, when we see that the state is a servant of the capitalist and not the inverse, it makes sense that the latter would prefer to lend money rather than be taxed. Booth explains that the crown began leaning on the capitalists for financial help, particularly during wartime. Since the crown would often default on debt, he continues, the bourgeoisie pushed through the creation of various national banks that had power over the minting of currency. Booth argues that this was a large victory for the capitalists agains the aristocracy - the control of the financial system (p.19). I think this is an interesting point, and underscores how the first victory of capitalism over feudalism was an economic one, and its gains were only politically mirrored later. 

Booth outlines how now that the state was dependent on creditors, its policy began to revolve around the repayment of debt - where once the capitalists and bankers were servants of the state, now they dominate it (p.19). 

## Credit and crisis
The author says that "banking and finance are fundamentally based upon money's role as a *means of payment* - a promise by the buyer to pay in the future." He explains that this role developed out of commodity circulation (p.20). Is this the accounting function of money coming more into the spotlight?

The author says that the bankers now play a dual role: they supply short-term credit to keep production moving, and they allow producers to expand production without having to posess all the upfront capital to do so. Furthermore, he explains, after the invention of fractional reserve banking, the bankers were now able to *create* credit and therefore artificially expand the market, artificially increase the purchasing power of society. Booth says that this plays an important role to delay crises of overproduction, because you can allow the working class to purchase more commodities back with their wages than they can really afford - kicking the can down the road (p.21). This seems like an important point - [[Credit delays economic crisis]]. 

Booth gives an overview of the reasons for the crisis of overproduction (p.22). [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. 

## Money and capital
Booth explains the rise of the joint-stock, limited-liability corporation. He notes that now, capitalists had an alternative to pursuing financing through the banks. They could, he says, seek to pool large or small sums of money, sharing the rights to the profits with many investors. Booth cites Marx to emphasize that the ownership of the company is not divided up, and rather a share represents the rights to a portion of the surplus value that the capital is hoped to produce (p.23). This is confusing to me, since I always thought it was the ownership of the firm that was distributed among the shareholders. 

Booth examines the idea that the stock market "democratizes" capitalism, and explains that it actually does the opposite - it concentrates small holdings of money so that they can be effectively used as capital by the ruling class (p.23). This is an excellent point, and reveals the naivety of those who think that speculative assets like crypto can provide a way to level the playing field. 

Booth says that as financialization progresses, capital ownership becomes ownership of a share of society's capital, entitling the owner to a "constant revenue stream, equivalent to the average rate of profit" (p.24). This is also confusing. Capital returns on the stock market often rise below or above the average rate of profit, and aren't constant in the slightest. What gives?

Building on that idea, Booth argues that financialization accelerates the socialization of production, with large, publicly-traded businesses already being run as social enterprises rather than private ones. He cites Marx, who refers to this process as "the abolition of capital as private property within the confines of the capitalist mode of production itself" (p.24). This is fascinating! What a good example of how [[Capitalism contains the seeds of socialist development]] in the financial sector, and how [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]]. 

# Part four: inflation and the gold standard
## The scourge of inflation
The article clarifies that while currency was often issued with the authority of a state, this is not to say that money was issued "from above." Rather, the author explains, it emerged as a social device to measure the real wealth of society, which is a reflection of the level of the productive forces (p.26-27). 

This means, Booth continues, that the amount of money in circulation must be linked with the total value of commodities in circulation, and the speed at which this money changes hands. He says that [[inflation]] is a reflection of market forces - when the money supply increases, he continues, the amount of money relative to the amount of commodities increases and money loses value relative to those commodities (p.27). [[An increase in the money supply causes inflation]]. 

The author says that a generalized inflation can only take place as a result of such an increase in the money supply and a resulting devaluation of the currency, or as a result of a rise in the price of a commodity that is necessary for a great many production processes, such as oil. Booth explains that in social terms, such an inflation represents a redistribution of wealth from the leder to the debtor, since debts become cheaper to repay (p.27). [[Inflation cheapens debt]]. 

However, Booth notes, indebted workers will feel the consequences of inflation when it comes to their purchasing power, since the general price of commodities will rise. He says that they can fight to increase their wages in response, and that [[Wage growth doesn't drive inflation]] (p.28). 

Booth notes that in the 2010s, we see remarkably loose monetary policy that ought to lead to inflation. Explaining the lack of such inflation, he says that the massive level of world overproduction is countering a general rise of prices. He explains that this glut of commodities and examples of excess capacity in all sectors are contradicting the increased money supply (p.29). 

## Monetary (in)stability
Booth tells us that in theory, the money supply will remain tied to the real economy via the demand for money. For instance, he says, if money were only created in order to service loans for expanded production, each new dollar would be backed by a corresponding increase in production. However, he says, money plays another role - [[Money lubricates commodity production]]. This means, he continues, that there is a demand for money far beyond any increases in production (p.29). 

Examining the implications of credit, Booth says that [[Credit severs money supply from the real economy]], engendring massive speculation and grift, while temporarily allowing capitalism to transcend some limits of the market by stimulating demand (p.30). 

## As good as gold
Booth explains that [[The gold standard was a reaction to loose monetary policy]], and that in turn, the need to fund warfare during [[WW1]] led to the abandonment of the standard. He goes on to explain that countries that held to this standard were forced to conduct "internal devaluations" to compete, meaning that they had to attack wages and working conditions since they were unable to print additional money (p.31-32). 

## The single currency
Booth outlines lessons for 2016, where he says we can see how the use of a single currency, the Euro, is heightening the contradictions of European capitalism. He notes that weaker countries like [[Spain]] and [[Greece]] are conducting the same kinds of internal devaluations in the face of deficits. He explains that these countries are told to become more competitive and become net exporters, but not all countries can be most competitive, and somebody has to soak up the demand for commodities produced by exporters (p.32-33). 

Booth highlights how the crisis is really caused by the limits of capitalism, and says that the monetary system is merely the form that the crisis is expressed through. Because of this, he continues, it's foolish to think that a return to the gold standard would be a real solution (p.34). I agree - [[The state cannot avert capitalist crisis]]. 

Ending the chapter, Booth explains the rise of the Bretton Woods system. He says that in 1944, this restored the international monetary system by fixing national currencies to the US dollar, which was backed by the fact that 2/3 of the world's gold was owned by the US government. This worked as long as American capitalism was ascendant, he says, but broke up as the American state began to pursue an inflationary policy to fund the war in [[Vietnam]]. He explains that this exported US inflation to the rest of the world and broke apart the system (p.34-35). 

# Part five: the future of money
## Paradigm shifts
Booth explains that the collapse of the Bretton Woods system "marked the death knell of both the international gold standard and the Keynesian consensus." Replacing this, he continues, came the program of [[monetarism]] (supply-side economics) which advocated tight currency discipline and internal devaluation, combined with "floating exchange rates" (p.37). 

More generally, Booth argues that every monetary system eventually reaches its limits, and its strengths become weaknesses, causing a reversal of the dominant system (p.37). 

The author asserts that neither monetarism of Keynesianism can really solve the issue, since it's an issue of capitalism rather than monetary policy (p.37). 

## Symptom and disease
What would happen, Booth asks, if governments just stopped interfering with the market, as the Hayekians would like? He argues that since the expansion of credit was needed to maintain demand for commodities throughout attacks on their purchasing power, that the world economy would never have emerged from the crisis of the 70s (p.38). 

Quoting Trotsky's address to the [[Comintern]] after [[WW1]], such a policy would only restore economic equilibrium at the cost of social and political equilibrium, and vice versa (p.38). This is a fundamental idea. 

Turning to the opposite strategy from the Hayekians, Booth critiques the idea of a "people's QE," the claim that we ought to place the banks under democratic control in order to prevent speculation and non-productuve investment. Booth finds fault with this due to two reasons: it attributes the problem to one of greedy bankers rather than economic logic of capitalism, and it ignores that any real banking reform will lead to an investment strike by the capitalists, as we're seeing in [[Venezuela]] today (p.38-39). 

Turning to the proponents of [[bitcoin]], Booth argues that they fail to understand that it is to volatile to function as a currency, and reflects a utopian and idealistic view of money (p.40). 

## The future of money
Turning to an analysis of money after a socialist revolution, Booth reminds us that we cannot simply abolish it overnight. He argues that we must first construct a society that precludes the *need* for currency (p.41). 

He believes that once the commanding heights of the economy are controlled by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], the efficiency of the planned economy will win over the small producers, who will voluntarily cede their capital to the plan in return for higher living conditions (p.42).

Within capitalism, he notes, we are already seeing the emergence of a "social wage," the value of the public services that the workers have won from the capitalist state. He argues that under socialism, this social wage will dramatically increase, and the ratio of social to individual wage will tilt towards the former as individual workers' wages will become more and more meaningless as more and more services are available for free, supported by an increase in the productivity of society (p.42). 

However, Booth explains, in the early stages of the transition, money and price signals will still be needed, but instead of being tools to generate profit, they would be tools to plan the economy and prepare for the withering away of currency and markets (p.43). 

Closing out the article, he quotes Trotsky, who says that we will only be able to proclaim the victory of socialism when the state turns into a semi-state, and money loses its ability to "bring happiness or trample men in the dust," and instead money becomes a bookkeeping reciept for the planners (p.44).
