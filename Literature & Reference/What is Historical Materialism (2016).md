## What is history?
Woods says that it is illogical to think that all phenomenae in the universe, from the big bang to the movement of atoms, are governed by rules that can be explained, but human history is not. 

He says that Marxists apply a [[materialism|materialistic]] perspective. To him, this means that we use the laws of science and believe that we *can* discover and interpret laws governing the development of human society. 

Woods claims that before [[Marx]] and [[Engels]], history was seen as a series of accidental events, unconnected. He says these two placed their study of history on a scientific basis, removing the [[moralism]] and [[idealism]] of other thinkers. 

## A caricature of Marxism
Under [[capitalism]], Woods says, science becomes less and less scientific the closer it gets to studying human society. 

In his opinion, all histories represent the point of view of one class or another. Woods says that history is written by the victors, and the history of the class war is no exception. 

For Woods, Marxists don't pretend to be neutral in the class struggle, but we can still be objective. Like a doctor, Woods says we are dedicated to caring for our patient, but this requires objective analysis, even when it doesn't paint our patient in a flattering light. 

The author says that some distort Marxism by saying that it reduces everything to economics. For Woods, this is overly fatalistic. If this were the case, he says we wouldn't have to fight to overthrow capitalism, through economic processes it would simply collapse. Woods says that unfortunately, this is far from the case. 

Woods says that all Marxism does is explain that the choices individuals make are constrained by forces beyond their control. And in the greater scheme of things, Woods says the viability of social systems is determined by the level of complexity of society and the [[means of production]], not the general sentiments of the population. 

## Marx and Darwin
Woods says Marxism is a genuine extension of the laws of [[evolution]] to the sphere of human society. However, to him, there is a problem with the way evolution is interpreted in our current society. 

He thinks evolution is understood as a slow, gradual process. When Woods applies this to politics, he says it seems to make the case for [[reformism]]. But there's a problem with this way of thinking - Woods says it isn't true.

In natural history, Woods says that we see periods of intense and rapid change, based on intense and rapid changes to the material conditions. He thinks that the same can be said about human society. He say this is called the theory of *punctuated equilibrium*. 

Woods says that we don't have to be alarmed that the ideas of Marxism only have a tiny following today. In his view, when things change, they do so rapidly. He says that every idea in history has had a tiny following until the time was right, such as the ideas of [[liberalism]] or Christianity. 

Woods claims that the changes in the material conditions that caused [[slave society]] to replace [[barbarism]], and feudalism to replace barbarism, and finally capitalism to replace [[feudalism]], are now closing in on [[capitalism]]. He points out that it makes no sense that this cyclical process of contradiction would suddenly halt when capitalism burst onto the scene. 

In Woods' view, capitalism is displaying all the symptoms of a system in decline. He points out that every year, the current mode of production is less and less able to meet the needs of humanity, and is therefore generating more and more enemies. 

## Socialism, utopian and scientific
In his [[Socialism - Utopian and Scientific (1880)|classic on dialectical materialism]], Woods says that [[Engels]] applied the laws of [[dialectical materialism]] to history. 

Woods says that the fundamental premise of Marxist theory of development is that the development of the productive forces drives all progress in society. However, he says that this process rarely occurs in a linear fashion. 

When a new mode of production is introduced, the productive forces begin to develop rapidly. Then after a time, their rate of development slows and eventually stagnates. However, for society to replace the mode of production is no simple matter. It takes a long period of stagnation and even a decline in the level of the productive forces to spur the population to revolution. That is the period that the world is now in.  

## [[stages of historical development]]
Woods says that the long arc of human history has been our gradual gaining of power over nature. He says that this has involved the passing through of various stages in our development, various modes of production. 

To Woods, these modes of production express themselves in the form of systems of class relations that we can study. He says the different class perspectives of people within these systems give rise to a definite social outlook, psychology, morality, and ideology. 

Woods brings up that the relationship between the [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]], which includes morality, ideology, culture, etc, is complicated. He says that we have to apply the dialectical method to understand the relationship between the economic forces that create opportunities for ideas to take hold, and the ideas themselves. He reminds us that sometimes ideas can stubbornly cling to life even as the economic viability of them is rapidly decreasing. 

Human [[class consciousness]] is inherently conservative. People would rather continue to believe what they have always believed until those beliefs become downright impossible to hold due to changed conditions. At certain periods when conditions change very quickly, the consciousness of the masses can rapidly "catch up" with reality and cause a shockwave to reverberate throughout society. That is what a revolution really is. 

## Early Human Society
The pace of change has been very slow for humanity overall. It took thousands of years to even develop anything we could call 'society.' It took even longer for humans to meaningfully differentiate themselves from apes.

Idealist predujuces caused the early study of human development to be centered around our larger brains. If ideas and thoughts are the driving motor of history, of course it makes sense that humans first developed larger brains, which allowed us to use tools and so on. But this isn't based in a materialistic analysis. 

Engels was correct in his analysis that these people were getting it backwards. And he was correct more than 100 years before anthropologists would realize their mistake. The "missing link" between humans and apes wouldn't be an ape with a larger brain, but a bipedal ape. 

Humans have many disadvantages compared to other animals. When we are born, we're helpless for years on end. The only thing we really have going for us is our ability to cooperate and perform manual [[labor]]. 

It was the bipedalism, which allowed the hands to be used for labor, which allowed humanity to progress past the other species, not a bigger brain. 

This progress allowed us to progress into the first phase of human history, which Marx called savagery. It was characterized by an extremely low development of the means of production, and a resulting hunter-gatherer existance. 

While life was brutal for most, we can still gain positive insight into this way of life. It shows that humans are not inherently selfish. For over 90% of our history, we lived communally, sharing resources and working together. 

No innate desire for the current form of private property can be found, even when we look to other species. Even among the most territorial species, the division of the habitat into territories is roughly even, with each member of the species having more or less the same slice of the pie. Not so today, where the vast majority own nothing of substance while a tiny ruling class owns the entire earth's wealth. 

Perhaps 'savagery' is too harsh a word nowadays. The lives of our ancestors were hard, but they had their benefits. Their lives were immensely social. They felt the support and bonds of a whole community that they lived their whole lives with, a feeling that not many today can really understand. 

Additionally, there was less of a rigid hierarchy between the genders, and no sense of class whatsoever. 

In many ways, the way we organize society today, with rising homelessness, orphans, and abuse pervading many families could more justly be called savage than the hunter-gatherers' way of life.

## The Neolithic Revolution
The transition from the hunter-gatherer mode of production to the agrucultural system laid the basis for the first great shift in the organization of humanity. 

As soon as productivity was high enough to produce a surplus from peoples' labor, the door was opened for class society to develop. Those who controlled the surplus gained power over the rest of humanity. 

We have to understand the development of class society in its own context. In the long term, class society was revolutionary because it liberated a tiny minority from manual labor, allowing them to develop art, science, and culture. The brutality of class society paved the way for humanity to develop the means of production to the level we are at today. 

We call this early period "barbarism." It featured the rise of the first cities, from which flowed writing and the earliest form of industry. The period lasted for a very long time, just as the [[primitive communism]] before it had. 

The development of mettalurgy, first through the Bronze Age and then into the Iron Age, revolutionized agriculture and warfare, laying a firmer and firmer basis for what we think of as civilization today. 

However, there were still big issues with this mode of production. The barter economy didn't really provide a way to re-invest the growing surplus being generated. 

As surpluses, in the form of grain and tools, rose, so did the opportunity for raids to secure wealth. This spurred the developements of the first states, which arose around settlements and markets to protect the new valuables. 

The ever-expanding dominion of private property brought with it massive changes in the relationships between people. The question of inheritance now had monumental importance for the children of the developing ruling class. 

It was in this period where the first instances of [[alienation]] occur. Private property alienates us from the products of our labor. The state alienates us from our very lives, as the ruler controls our fate. Even our spiritual lives are alienated from us, as our souls are appropriated by deities in the next life, whose representatives in this world we must obey. 

## Slavery and [[the Asiatic mode of production]]
The main features of the so-called "Asiatic" mode of production are...
1. An urban society reliant on an agrarian base
2. Public works, frequently identified with the need for irrigation
3. A despotic system of government, often headed by a god-king
4. A large bureaucracy
5. A system of exploitation based on taxation
6. State ownership of land

Although slavery existed in these societies, they were not actually slave societies. There was an element of coercion, but the main driving force maintaining the labor force was habit, tradition, and [[religion]]. 

The state and [[religion]] are deliberately combined and mixed up, and people are taught to serve the state blindly, mainly in the form of paying taxes in the form of goods. They do this even though each village is mainly self-reliant and not very well connected to neighboring villages. 

Social mobility was virtually non-existent, and in some cases a caste system prevented it outright. 

Examples of this form of society include the Chinese Shang and Yin dynasties and the Indus Valley civilization. 

The most striking features of these societies are their extremely slow rate of development and the length in which they sometimes survive. This was an essentially static mode of society. 

Marx never developed his analysis of this mode of human organization, because he didn't consider it very important. In the end, the road of human development laid elsewhere - in the Greek and Roman societies.

## Slavery
Greek society was formed under unique conditions. Because they lacked lots of arable land and couldn't really expand, they were forced to take on the role of a seafaring nation, turning to trade instead of agriculture. 

This different economic basis laid the foundations for a different outlook. The ancient Greeks developed an early form of democracy, at least for free citizens. However, the majority of those who did the work of society were slaves. 

We cannot look at history from the point of view of morality. We have to examine the force that a certain mode of production played, and the Greek and Roman slave societies moved humanity forward for a time. 

> It was not so much _from slavery_ as _through slavery_ that humanity was emancipated.
> - [[Hegel]]

The Romans sold whole cities into slavery, and butchered thousands of prisoners for amusement. And yet, we have them to thank for the foundation of our whole culture and civilization. 

## Decline of slave society
The [[slave society]] contains a contradiction. It's only viable because of the sheer number of slaves being put to work, since individually the productivity of a slave is quite low. And since slaves don't reproduce that much in captivity, the only way to really increase productivity is through warfare and the aquisition of new slaves by force. Because of this, [[Slavery requires expansion]]. 

Once the Roman Empire had reached its limits of expansion, society began to stagnate. This stagnation led to an intensification of the class struggle between rich and poor, Patrician and Pelbian, in [[Rome]]. 

An internal struggle between the ruling class emerged. A faction attempted to convert Roman society to one based on small landholders, but was defeated by the powerful slaveholders who wanted to maintain slavery as the basis for Roman civilization. 

This was a disaster in the long run. As more and more Roman peasants were ruined, they drifted into Rome where they began to constitute a [[lumpenproletariat]] living off the state. 

The slave revolts led by [[Spartacus]] were a glorious uprising of the oppressed, but failed to overthrow Roman society. They failed because the slaves didn't link up with the small urban proletariat. As long as the latter still supported the state, victory was impossible.

It's important to note that the Roman proletariat was quite different from the modern one. It was a parasitical class living off the labor of the slaves. 

The deadlock that Roman society arrived at was kind of like [[Bonapartism]]. It took the form of Caesarism in Rome. 

As the class struggle became more and more violent, with neither class able to defeat the other, the state began to have more and more independence of either class. The Roman Republic died, and the Roman Empire was born. 

During periods like this, there can be a great sense of despair and malaise. Christianity filled the vaccum of a productive worldview. 

## Why the barbarians triumphed
By the time the [[barbarism|barbarians]] invaded, Roman society was teetering on the edge of collapse. The barbarians were actually welcomed as a liberating force by the majority of the lower classes. 

There had been steady migration out of the cities to rural areas, foreshadowing the formation of [[feudalism]] as the next mode of production. The barbarians were merely the historical accident that fufilled the necessity of the collapse of the Empire. 

> Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, _or in the common ruin of the contending classes_.

The example of the Roman Empire provides a stark example of Marx's last sentence. Because a revolution never succeeded, the whole society was doomed to be swept away eventually. 

This collapse put human development back by a thousand years. We are facing a similar situation, along with a new Dark Age of our own, if we are unable to overthrow our outdated mode of production as the oppressed Romans were. [[The future will either be socialism or barbarism]]. 

## Feudalism 
After the demise of the Roman Empire, there were no inventions, save for the water wheel and the windmill, for over 1,000 years. Even after a thousand years, all of Europe was unable to surpass the decaying infrastructire set up by Rome. 

Eventually the chaos subsided, and a new equilibrium emerged - feudalism. The [[currency|money]] economy had collapsed and been replaced by barter. Small, isolated communities proliferated across Europe. 

Power was decentralized into the hands of local landowners, who appropriated the surplus of the regional serfs. This meant that the power of the various monarchies were quite limited by the powerful aristocracies. 

It was this weak center that eventually permitted the relative independence of the towns where the first elements of the bourgeoisie formed. 

As the bourgeoisie gained more and more power relative to the aristocracy, the two classes came more and more into conflict. 

## The Black Death
The decline of a socio-economic system affects all spheres of life. Intellectual life, culture, and science all began to stagnate and decline alongside feudalism. 

As the population expanded but technology did not, more and more people were barely eking out a living on smaller and smaller plots of land. 

Just as the invasion of the barbarians had been the historical accident that pushed Roman society over the edge, the Black Death pushed Europe over the brink of collapse. 

Killing between one third and one half of the population, the plague served to highlight the irrationality of the system and lay the foundation for its overthrow.

Because it killed so much of the peasantry, those who survived found themselves in posession of a lot more land than before. This created a new class of rich peasants. 

There was also a tremendous shortage of labor in the cities. Feeling their strength, the peasants demanded higher wages and lower rents. The nobles had no choice but to give in, loosening and then breaking the bonds that had bound the peasantry for a thousand years. 

However, the peasants never fully overthrew the feudal system. The material conditions were not quite ripe enough for a bourgeois revolution, and thus their repeated uprisings never succeeded. 

Just like in other periods of decline, a general feeling of doom pervaded the culture of this time. Religious sects wandered the land, preaching an immenent apocalypse. 

## The rise of the bourgeoisie
By the middle of the 1600s, the old belief systems that kept society running were unraveling. Peasants were refusing to follow orders, and often migrated without license from their lords. 

The towns were functioning as small islands of capitalism in the sea of rural feudalism, and were slowly undermining the old order. 

Alongside the new economc basis forming, a new cultural movement was taking its first steps. The Renaissance emerged alongside the bourgeoisie in the freest cities. 

## The reformation
By the 1500s, capitalism had become well established in Europe. The Netherlands were acting as the factory of Europe, and trade was flourishing. 

The increases in productive force encouraged new developments of philosophy and thought. It's no coincidence that the cities which led in terms of economics also led in terms of art, science, and technology. 

The forces developing in the belly of the feudal structure eventually made their voices heard through the vehicle of religion. When Martin Luther's criticisms of the Church reached the ears of the peasants, they ignited a fire across Europe. 

Beginning in 1524, the Peasants' War spread across central Europe until it was crushed 2 years later. While it had taken on the ideas of Martin Luther, even he eventually sided with the ruling class and the bourgeoisie in crushing the peasants. 

## The bourgeois revolutions
The first sign of upheaval came in the Netherlands. The wealthy merchants leaned on the poor in their quest to throw off Spanish domination. 

The next state to face revolution was England. This time, the class struggle between the masses and the aristocracy was expressed in the form of civil war. This civil war was only ended when Cromwell, basing himself on the most radical elements, swept the bourgeois to one side and began a fierce battle against the Royalists. The lower ranks of the army, under the leadership of [[Levellers]], tried to take the revolution further but were crushed. 

The Levellers represented the lower layers of the petit bourgeoise and were unable to rely on any working class, since the proletariat was still in the early stages of formation. 

In one country after another, a process like this happened. The forms changed due to the local condtions, but the class content of the struggle remained the same. The aristocracy was under attack by the masses, who were egged on by the bourgeoisie. Then when the bourgeoisie gained the upper hand, they used the state to crush those among the masses who tried to go farther than the bourgeois approved of. 

The victory of capitalism across Europe laid the basis for a tremendous upswing in economic potential. 

## The Russian revolution
[[Russia|The Russian revolution]] was, for Marxists, the greatest single event in human history. 

The first socialist revolution happened in a backwards country, not in the advanced countries that Marx expected. 

Because Russia didn't have the material basis to establish a socialist society, it inevitably mutated into a bureaucratic degenerated [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]. 

## Unprecendented advance
Every phase of human society has its roots in the previous world. And each revolutionary upsurge by a class inevitably transforms into a conservative force preventing the next revolution. So it happened with the feudal aristocracy, and so it will be for the bourgeoisie. 

## Capitalism in decline
Every epoch seems like it will last forever. Even during periods of decline, it was easier for those people to imagine the world itself was ending rather than the mode of production was coming to a close. 

We can see the same processes taking place today. Liberal commenters despair that our country is being ripped apart by ignorance and tribalism, while Marxists understand that these are the inevitable forces tearing capitalism apart at the seams. 

## Socialism or barbarism
Sooner or later, capitalism will arrive at an impasse. Like the Romans before us, we will either resolve the contradictions through a victory of the working class over the ruling class, or society will disintegrate just as the Roman one did.

## Consciousness
The mood of the masses is dependent on past events, not the present situation. After the fall of the USSR, the ruling class launched a ferocious attack against the ideas of socialism and Marxism, trying to bury these dangerous ideas forever. 

But we know that ideas are just manifestations of the interests of one class or another. Therefore, while the working class exists, there will be socialists, and there will be Marxists. 

The embryo of the new world is already growing in the womb of the old. It is the role of Marxists to act as midwife, hastening and easing the pains of this inevitable birth. 

## From necessity to freedom
With a strong basis in a scientific understanding of history, Marxists must have an optimistic outlook. The general tendency of humanity has been to move towards liberation and development of our potential. 

Once the productive forces are freed from the straitjacket of capitalism, we can expect a monumental shift in the standards of living of global society. 

In a certain sense, socialism is symmetrical with the hunter-gatherer way of life, but on a vastly higher technological level. On the basis of a planned economy and democratic control of all capital, we will no longer have need for the exploitation that capitalism and the previous modes of production required.
