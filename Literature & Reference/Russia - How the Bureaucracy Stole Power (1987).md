# Russia: How the Bureaucracy Stole Power
---
```ad-info
This is a republished pamphlet from 1987, by someone in the [[CWI]]. It gives the [[trotskyism|Trotskyist]] perspective on the legacy of the USSR.
   ```
## The October Revolution
The original Congress of Soviets asserted that revolution must be international, and it must usher in a democratic workers’ government. 

[[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]] spoke for the majority of delegates in saying as much.

## The Counter-Revolution
The behavior of the workers just after workers power was declared shows that once the working class has taken control, it is impossible to halt the expropriation of the whole capitalist class. 

As class struggle reached its climax, Russian society was utterly paralyzed. Trade between cities and agricultural regions totally stopped. The banks were nationalized and workers spontaneously occupied more and more factories. 

The Russian Civil War began, as [[kulak]], capitalists, and Tsarists allied with anti-Bolshevik ‘leftists.’ Troops from the [[UK]], [[USA]], and [[Japan]] occupied key ports across [[Russia]]. [[France]] occupied the Black Sea. 

## How the Bolsheviks Defeated the Counter-Revolution
After the Russian Rev, Europe was plunged into a revolutionary period as well. This tied down the ruling class in these countries, and helped end their attacks on Russia. Strikes rippled across [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], and [[Germany]] as workers refused to aid in the war effort on Russia.

In [[Finland]], a Workers’ Republic was proclaimed, later to be crushed with the help of German troops. 

Then, the German revolution began. All across Europe, workers refused to aid in the counter-revolution. 

Trotsky was central in the construction of the Red Army. Built as a revolutionary organization, it developed its own vanguard of young workers. 

Finally, the Whites lost support of the [[peasantry]], and were defeated. 

## Setbacks in the International Struggle
The overthrow of [[capitalism]] across Europe was within grasp at this point. If it had happened, the degeneration of the Soviet Union wouldn’t have happened. However, a new International needed to be built for this purpose. 

## The Crisis of Working-Class Leadership
The [[Second International]] betrayed their values when they went to bat for their national governments at the onset of [[WW1]]. Why did this happen? 

The [[Second International]] was built during a period of capitalist expansion, which had a decisive effect upon its character. Using electoral methods, the member parties were able to secure significant concessions, creating a[[ labor aristocracy]] in their home countries. This electoralism, combined with success going to their heads, made the leaders of these parties increasingly bent towards[[reformism]]. 

In 1919, the Russian Communist Party, newly named, convened the Third International, aka the Communist International or [[Comintern]]. 

## From the “Platform of the Communist International” Adopted at the Founding Conference
This new International was internationalist and revolutionary in outlook. However, the Marxist currents outside Russia were too weak to retain the gains made early on in the struggle. Large sections of the German proletariat were still with the [[SPD]] leaders, even as the SPD helped legitimize the destruction of the workers’ councils across Germany and the murder of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Liebknecht]]. 

The Comintern was composed of 51 national sections, with a membership of 2.8 million worldwide. 

Hungarian Communists failed due to ultra-leftism. They refused to divide the land amongst the peasants, insisting on collectivizing instead. The peasants didn’t like this, and refused to support the revolution when Romanian and Czech armies invaded to crush it. 

In [[Italy]], ‘revolutionary’ leadership wavered in the other direction, towards [[reformism]] at the critical moment. In 1920, a massive wave of factory takeovers occured, with workers councils and Red Guards formed to manage and defend them. However, the Italian Socialist Party didn’t really want to lead a revolution, and were only forced to align with the Comintern by pressure from below. They allowed reformists and reactionaries to gain the upper hand, defusing the situation in return for some temporary concessions. 

This was not a great situation, and Russia was getting a little exhausted. 

## The Exhaustion of Soviet Democracy
The economy was basically shit in 1920. It was putting out only ~10% of what it had in 1913 and there was famine all over the place.

The alliance between workers and peasants was also strained, as the peasants just really wanted more land and didn’t care about much beyond that. 

The Communists chose to end freedom of speech and organization, rather than risk counterrevolution if more of the peasants were swayed to join the forces of reaction. This was the period of War Communism, the strict control over resource distribution by the Soviet government. They hoped that after the international revolution, a transition could be made from control over distribution to control over production as a starting point for a planned socialist economy. 

What was worse, the ranks of the workers had been seriously thinned by the civil war and the collapse of industry. The political [[cadre]] of the workers had been virtually eradicated on the front. The trend was a dissolution of the working class, with workers being absorbed back into the peasantry which was becoming more and more reactionary. 

*The text seems to describe industrial centers with peasant populations. What is the definition of peasant in this context?*

Because of all this BS, the Soviets were not functioning correctly. They weren’t meeting often enough or with enough preparedness to manage the economy. Without mass participation in the management of the economy, degeneration was inevitable. 

## Bureaucracy and the Workers’ State
Lenin laid the ground rules for how to run a workers’ state. Nobody gets paid more than an average skilled worker, rotate administrative duties among a wide group, all workers must bear arms to protect the revolution, and all power must be vested in the Soviets. He said as much in [[The State and Revolution (1917)]].

The former Tsarist state numbered hundreds of thousands of officials, while [[Bolsheviks]] numbered only 23K. They couldn’t thoroughly transform the Russian state under the horrible conditions, and were forced to keep on specialists from the old regime. In order to retain these specialists, the Communists were forced to give special privileges and higher wages to these people, or else they would flee the country. 

The transitional state is torn between two worlds, the world of capitalism, filled with specialists, cushy positions, and wage [[labor]], and the world of workers control, lacking these elements. However, the Russian state was no longer transitioning in the right direction. The Soviets were degrading, while specialists were regaining old privileges from the Tsarist regime. 

> “When there are enough goods in a store, the purchasers can come when they want to. When there are a few goods, the purchasers are compelled to stand in line. When the lines are very long, it is necessary to appoint a policeman to keep order. Such is the starting point of the Soviet bureaucracy.” - Trotsky, [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]]

The bureaucracy can only wither away to the extent that it is no longer needed to manage the economy. 

Through the bureaucracy, the reactionary classes began to find a tool for protecting their remaining privileges. As the Soviets ceded more and more authority to these specialists and bureaucrats, their power grew. 

## Party Democracy
The Communist Party was the last line of defense at this point. The highest Soviet executive council was only meeting three times a year, meaning that the Sovnarkom (Council of Peoples’ Commissars) was the only effective organ of state power. This was filled with Communists elected from the Party. 

The Communist Party had always had a strong internal democracy, with robust debates at many policy questions. Even in the Red Army, opposition groups emerged who questioned certain military policies. They were defeated not at gunpoint but through debate. 

## The Kronstadt Uprising
The sailors had become more [[Anarchism|anarchist]], and staged an insurrection against the government. Trotsky ordered the attack on the fort, fearing that the Whites would be able to attack Petrograd directly without the protection of the fort. 

The tenuous situation led to a decision to dissolve all organized factions within the Party. Lenin said that this was needed because the unity of the party was riding on a small number of Old Guard Marxists, within whom a split would destroy the entire Party, and with it, the USSR. 

*How would outlawing formal factions prevent such a split? Wouldn’t it just remove any internal mechanism for resolving differences?*

It seems that this was meant only to be a temporary measure. Weakness invites aggression and the party wanted to hold out until a revolution in Europe was able to send help. This probably did help speed up the consolidation of Stalinist forces. 

## The Struggle for Power in the Communist Party
In 1921, war communism was abandoned, and the NEP began to be implemented. The NEP did help revive the economy, mainly in the light industrial sector. However, the NEP was a serious retreat in the class war. It created a new class of NEPmen who took advantage of shortages to profit. 

The kulaks and NEPmen were gaining connections in the state bureaucracy, consolidating and strengthening their position. 

This new layer was not a class in the proper sense, as they did not have an essential role in production. Rather, it was a parasitic layer. 

*Would the aristocracy be considered a class? I guess they do own the land, so they are I suppose. *

The Marxist cadre in the party was already stretched to the breaking point by the demands of public duties, and on top of this there was a massive influx of new members. Many of these new members were careerists, from former Mensheviks to NEPmen.

The first purge of the party was carried out in 1921-22. Unlike the later purges, it was carried out to remove false Communists from the ranks. A Commissariat for investigating corruption and bureaucratism within the party was also formed. [[Stalin]] was put in charge of this, and was also made General Secretary. 

*What does the General Secretary do?*

The investigational Commissariat utterly failed, partly because of incompetence, but also because of the weakness of the [[proletariat]] nationally and internationally. 

Stalin’s rise during this time was due more to the changing balance of forces in Russian society than to his own cunning. He was a reliable ally for the new forces of bureaucratism who wanted the cover of an old and respected Bolshevik who wasn’t that resistant to offering privileges their way.  

## The Turning Point
1923-24 marked the point at which internal contradictions erupted in the Soviet Union. Many viewed Trotsky as more of a threat to the party than Stalin, and [[Kamenev]] and [[Zinoviev]] conspired with Stalin to get rid of him.

Lenin instructed Trotsky to attack Stalin at the 12th party congress in 1923, but Trotsky didn’t. Stalin had cunningly retreated, accepting all of Trotsky’s criticism of his recent actions. Trotsky didn’t want to be seen as struggling for power unnecessarily, and backed down. 

The Scissors Crisis exploded, as agricultural prices plummeted and industrial goods became more expensive. This threatened to tear apart the two most important sectors of the Soviet economy. Strikes across the country were broken up on the orders of the bureaucracy, and the leaders were arrested. 

At this point, Trotsky and others formed the 1923 Opposition. Their demands were to restore party democracy, adopt a more planned economy, and to expropriate the kulaks. The opposition was banned and repressed at first, but mass support forced the bureaucracy to give in, at least on paper. 

## The Defeat of the German Revolution
In 1923, conditions in Germany once again reached a boiling point. The economy was crashing due to the Treaty of Versailles, and the workers were swinging hard to the left. The [[KPD]] was unprepared for this, and their leadership was divided, unsure of what to do. This cost them the whole situation. The [[KPD]] surrendered as soon as the German bourgeoisie mounted a counter-attack. 

It was now clear that nobody was coming to save the Soviet Union. The cynicism of the bureaucrats began to look more and more appealing to less educated workers. 

## The Invention of [[Trotskyism]]
The bureaucracy resorted to rigging the vote to prevent opposition delegates from having seats in the 1924 party conference. 

Then, after Lenin’s death, they began a massive drive to increase the number of workers among the party. This provided a fresh source of votes against the opposition, as the new recruits were totally uneducated in Marxism. 

Internationally, the Comintern criticized these new developments. The triumvirate (Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev) didn’t like that. Zinoviev, the president of the Comintern, began a campaign to disband the leading bodies of national parties to get rid of Trotsky’s supporters. 

Then, the triumvirate sought to highlight all the differences between Trotsky and Lenin, calling him everything from an ultra-left to a Menshevik. While Trotsky came down on the side of the Mensheviks for a few months after the split, this was before their political differences really became clear to everyone. 

With the defeat of the German workers, the bureaucracy saw ahead a long period of isolation. World revolution seemed like wishful thinking. Material conditions drive ideas, and these conditions drove Stalin to produce a new theory of socialist change. 

## ‘Socialism in One Country’
Stalin cherry-picked quotes from Lenin in which he said that the political conditions for socialism had been reached in Russia and took them to mean that socialism could be constructed in Russia alone. Just a few months ago, Stalin himself had said that this was impossible. Now, history was rewritten to look like this was always a key idea. 

This new theory made defense of the USSR the goal of all Communists worldwide, instead of overthrowing capitalism elsewhere. (This was realized when Stalin dissolved the Comintern later).

The bureaucracy began to rely more and more on the kulaks to support the agricultural sector. 

Tension began to arise within the triumvirate. Kamenev and Zinoviev didn’t like sharing power with Stalin, who they viewed as ruthless and mediocre. 

## Why Marxism Stands for Internationalism
Socialism relies on advanced productive forces to create a state of abundance. Without such conditions. If socialism doesn’t raise living standards, it has no justification, nor support. Workers’ democracy is also a fundamental precondition to socialism. 

Our current living standards under capitalism require the combined effort of many countries, and therefore to maintain and increase these standards under socialism, the combined efforts of many countries would be required. 

*Based on these material conditions, what could they really do? It seems like there wasn’t fertile ground for revolution in Europe after 1923, so what would Trotsky have done if he was able to defeat Stalin?*

## What ‘Socialism in One Country’ Really Meant
The bureaucracy viewed the threat of foreign capitalist countries in purely military terms. However, since the Soviet Union couldn’t provide for its own economic needs, it was forced to trade with capitalist countries. This flow of cheaper [[commodities]] was an unrecognized threat. How could the workers be expected to defend socialism against an enemy that was apparently offering them a better life? 

*This article, written in 1987, says that “there is no longer any possibility of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union.” Oops! I guess not even these guys saw that one coming only 4 years later. To be fair, they’re talking about the possibility of a military invasion.*

WIthout the material basis for abundance, the Soviet Union could only construct a society of inequality. 

In 1926, Zinoviev and Kamenev allied with Trotsky against Stalin. Stalin re-aligned with the right wing of the party. At the same time, the Stalinists betrayed a large general strike by workers in the [[UK]], dooming the movement. In [[China]], Stalinist [[opportunism]] betrayed the workers once again, choosing to back the [[Kuomintang]] and it’s class collaborationist ideas. This gave Chiang Kai-Shek an opportunity to massacre Communists and workers in 1927, ending the [[CPC]] as a proletarian revolutionary organization. 

These international defeats, while caused by Stalin and the bureaucracy, gave more leverage to their cynical worldview. 

## The Defeat of the joint Left Opposition
Trotsky and the LO called for the revitalization of the soviets, and intense industrialization. The bureaucracy had put forward a five-year plan under left pressure, but this plan centered the interests of the kulaks and didn’t industrialize enough. 

The bureaucracy resorted to a campaign of intimidation against the LO. However, at mass demonstrations, the workers were listening to Trotsky and others. The police began to break these demonstrations up by force. Marxist opposition was driven underground. 

Zinoviev and Kamenev lost their will, and begged to be taken back by Stalin. Trotsky was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929. 

## Proletarian Bonapartism
Trotsky theorized that the workers’ state had begun to degenerate into what he called ‘proletarian Bonapartism.’ 

[[Bonapartism]], named after the regime of Napoleon, is a form of bourgeois government in crisis. It implies political veering between classes, but is fundamentally based on bourgeois property relations. Proletarian Bonapartism is based instead on state ownership of property. 

The USSR veered between serving the interests of multiple classes, in a battle to keep the rickety boat afloat. First, they aid the kulaks. Then, they seize the kulaks grain as the threat of capitalist restoration becomes too real. 

Stalin chose to impose collectivization by force, rather than succumb. This shattered his alliance with the right wing of the party, and ended the NEP. 

Stalin, who once decried Trotsky as a ‘super-industrializer,’ turned towards rapid industrialization as a way out. Soviet industrial production increased by 250%, even as the Great Depression swept the world. Even though this shows the great potential of [[economic planning]], it was done in a bureaucratic mess. Wildly unrealistic orders were issued by bureaucrats, and failure to execute them was declared as sabotage. Forced labor was used on many projects. The standard of living for workers decreased while the bureaucracy’s privileges became more entrenched. 

## From the “Third Period...”
Foreign policy of the USSR also took on a bureaucratic character. Stalin said that the final crisis of capitalism was beginning (the “third period”), a totally anti-Marxist view. Marxists assert that every crisis of capitalism will be resolved at the expense of the workers until capitalism is overthrown. 

Stalin overcorrected from prior reformism internationally, and swung to an ultra-left tact. He began to argue that Social Democracy is the moderate wing of fascism. This deviation split the working class in Germany, allowing Hitler to seize control. As workers looked for a solution to the economic crisis in Germany, the KPD focused only on disrupting the activities of the SPD. As the [[Nazi Party]] organized, the KPD refused to ally with the SPD, even though the combined force of them could have crushed the Nazis.

After Hitler seized power, the Comintern couldn’t even muster a criticism of this failure. This convinced Trotsky that the Comintern was dead as an instrument of revolution.

## ...to the ‘people’s front’
Stalin first tried to appease [[Hitler]], worried about what a war would mean for the USSR. He didn’t put up a fight as all the Communists were put into camps. 

The new international threats totally reversed the ultra-leftism of the Stalinists, who once again sped to the right. Forgetting that they had proclaimed capitalism on the way out just a few years earlier, they went asking for help from the imperialist powers. These powers welcomed the USSR into the international community. This membership in the community of [[imperialism]] would again and again cause the USSR to betray the workers as a precondition for maintaining the friendship of the capitalists. 

Trotsky predicted that the Comintern would soon disintegrate along national lines, and this quickly became the case. 

Class demands were dropped from programs of Communist parties worldwide, in order to gain broader support from the petit bourgeoisie. The new slogan was one of a ‘people’s front.’ Even when the middle class wasn’t a mass force, this tactic persisted. Its real aim was to build leverage with capitalist countries for the purposes of Soviet foreign policy. 

In [[Spain]] in 1936, workers seized power almost spontaneously. Stalin viewed this as a disaster, as he was trying to curry favor with the [[UK]] and [[France]]. Also, he didn’t want Russian workers to begin to make demands of his government. The Communist Party of Spain declared that there must first be a bourgeois revolution in Spain before workers could take control. Without an authentic Marxist leadership, the struggle was extinguished. 

## Rivers of Blood
Bureaucratism leads to tyranny, which reinforces itself as the bureaucrats have more and more reason to fear revenge. 

The only ones who commanded as much respect as Stalin were the old Bolsheviks. A new layer of young party members were looking back to October and wanted to recreate it. Contradictions were heightening between this new layer and the bureaucrats. Party expulsions ran in the hundreds of thousands. 

As the Spanish situation posed a clear example of authentic workers' government, the bureaucracy began the Moscow trials. One after another, old Bolsheviks were accused of conspiring with Trotsky, who was now apparently a German spy and an agent of capitalism. 

22 years since 1917, only 1.3% of the members of the Communist Party remained. 
This terror was not the result of Stalin alone, but of a culmination of a larger counter-revolution by the bureaucracy against the revolutionary working class. 

## Conclusion
Trotsky always defended the gains of the Russian Revolution, the planned and state-owned economy. He rejected the idea that the USSR was state-capitalist. At the same time, he said that the political preconditions for socialism would have to be re-established through a mass movement and overthrow of the state.
