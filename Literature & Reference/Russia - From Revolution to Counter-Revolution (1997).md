# Preface to the 2017 edition
## About the present work
The author explains the historical context for this book, and says that through the method of [[Marxism]], we can see insights that both the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] "experts" totally failed to see, including glimpses of the future collapse of the [[Russia|USSR]]. 

## The question of the class nature of Russia
[[Alan Woods]] says that this question occupied the minds of Marxists for a whole generation. He says that the precise course of events were impossible to predict, although [[Ted Grant]] did predict, in 1972, that the USSR would collapse, he failed to see that it was [[capitalism]] that would replace it. Woods says that Grant put too much faith in the notion that the traditions of the [[Bolsheviks]] would remain breathing, and that the Communist Party could be overthrown by the working class. Cutting him some slack, Woods says that the situation hadn't been played out, and that this was certainly a possibility when Grant wrote the book. 

Woods traces the line of thought developed by [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] during the 20s and 30s, as he analyzed the beginnings of Stalinism. He also notes that the victory, first of Stalinism over Bolshevism, and then of capitalist restoration, was not guaranteed, and only developed due to the interplay of subjective and objective factors over a whole historic period. 

## What the book contains
Woods says that the first part of the book contains a defense of the October Revolution, and a critique of the theory of state capitalism. He explains that there's no need to revise Grant's deep belief that the restoration of capitalism could be reversed, even after the crisis of 1998, and he points to bourgeois analysts who were worried about just that. 

# Introduction by Alan Woods
Woods explains the errors of those who spouted nonsense about the "end of history."

## Fear of revolution
Woods explains the burning need for the bourgeoisie to smear the October revolution, and says that the crimes of Stalinism came in handy. He argues that the chief strategy for slandering the revolution consisted of identifying the work of Lenin, Trotsky, and the Bolsheviks with the later terrors of Stalin, and the ineptitude of the bureaucracy that he represented. 

## What the revolution achieved
Woods argues that the nationalized, planned economy of the USSR resulted in tremendous advances. He cites the increases in the literacy rate, the wealth of society, and other factors that he says have been hidden by the strategists of [[capital]] in an effort to erase the real advances that even a flawed and half-completed advance towards a socialist society brought. 

## Unprecedented advance
Woods highlights how within 20 years of the implementation of a planned economy, illiteracy was erased, and even despite [[WW2]], the [[GDP]] of the USSR increased by 900% in a span of 50 years. He says that even into the 70s, the USSR was rapidly catching up to the [[USA]] in terms of GDP and other metrics. 

He also notes that this was all done with no unemployment and no inflation, and with a balanced budget without any national debt. 

> [!note]
> At this point I can confidently say that [[Planned economies outperform market systems]]. 

## Women and the October Revolution
Woods cites numbers that demonstrate the material advances made by women after the October revolution, even despite the counter-reforms that were implemented by the bureaucracy under Stalin. He says that women were entitled to retirement at 55, as well as maternity leave for 56 days before and 56 days after childbirth, for a total of 112 days, or nearly 4 months. Furthermore, he continues, 75% of doctors were women. 

> [!note]
> This demonstrates evidence for how [[Socialism provides a path towards womens' liberation]]. 

## Why the Soviet Union collapsed
Woods argues that there was a fundamental contradiction in Soviet society between the well-functioning aspects of the planned economy and the total mismanagement of the bureaucracy, who failed to provide high quality and available consumer goods, and whose existence directly contradicted the official propaganda of equality among all Soviet citizens. 

Woods explains that the bureaucracy was always a brake on production, and as the economy increased in complexity their impact dragged the economy down more and more. He says that corruption, waste, and disregard for the needs of the working class were the big issues. 

As the growth rate of the USSR fell nearer and nearer to that of the capitalist world, and then fell below it, Woods explains, the fate of the bureaucracy was sealed. He notes that in 1972, Ted Grant predicted the demise of Stalinism based on this evidence. 

## Trotsky's analysis
Woods draws on the analysis given by [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] in [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]], saying that he accurately, if incompletely, predicted the possibility of a return to capitalism in the USSR if the bureaucracy was not defeated. 

Woods criticizes the theory of "state capitalism," saying that it ignores the differences between the crises of capitalism and the crises of Stalinism, and effectively disarms the workers in their quest to defend the positives of the October revolution while excising the cancer of the bureaucracy. 

## Caricature of socialism
Woods concludes this introduction by explaining that he is a firm supporter of the October revolution, and believes that sooner or later, the workers in Russia will remember the tradition of October and will rise to reclaim their revolutionary heritage. 

# 1. The balance sheet of October
## The advace of the planned economy
Grant defends the massive advances resulting from the October revolution, and underlines how Russia's place in the world rose dramatically, especially considering its starting point as a country more backwards and undeveloped than modern-day India. 

He continues, noting the massive advantages the planned economy brought in the fields of education, heavy industry, resource extraction, and more. He argues that these advances would have been higher if there was a regime of true workers' democracy instead of the bureaucratic mis-management that plagued the system. 

Grant argues that as centralized economic planning replaced capitalism, blind market forces were replaced by conscious planning. However, he says, this planning required the involvement of the whole population to be carried out effectively, and the bureaucratic clique in Moscow were more and more unable to do it themselves. He attributes the shuddering halt of economic progress in the 70s to this phenomenon. 

## Was the October Revolution a coup?
Grant attacks the "conspiratorial view of history" that calls the Bolshevik seizure of power a coup. He says that this is impossible, given the fact that the masses were thinking more clearly and were more active in society than at any point in Russia's history. 

He also examines the relationship between the party and the masses, saying that in any revolutionary situation, a section of the leadership of the revolutionary party comes under the influence of alien class ideas and begins to vaccilate, unsure of itself - this was reflected in Stalin, Kamenev, and Zinoviev's failure to decisively oppose the Provisional Government. Grant says that this influence took an internal struggle to defeat, with Lenin and Trotsky appealing directly to the advanced workers and calling on them to continue their march to the left. 

He explains that the real role of the revolutionary party is not to seize power behind the backs of the masses, but to provide a thought-out, revolutionary program to the masses that can lead the way out of the crisis. For the Bolsheviks, he continues, this sometimes even meant holding back the revolutionary energy of the most advanced sections, as to save them from jumping the gun. 

## Permanent mobilization
Grant argues that in those days, Russian workers were eagerly consuming political and philisophical literature, and hotly debating the issues of the day at all hours. He says that the masses were desperate to learn about the world, and sought a way out of the crisis. 

He explains that the masses engaged with the programs of all political tendencies, and began to reject the alternatives to the Bolsheviks one by one, as they came into power and were discredited. He notes that by September 1917, the Bolsheviks had won majorities in the soviets of all the major cities, and as a result, their membership had gone from 8,000 in February to over 170,000 in July 1917. 

## Party and class
Grant says that even the enemies of the Bolsheviks and of the revolution in general admitted that the Bolsheviks had won the attention of the masses, and Grant explains that the involvement of the masses at every stage of the revolution was the decisive factor. 

Grant attacks the theory of the October revolution as coup, saying that those who call attention to the small number of participants in the actual insurrection misunderstand the nature of revolution. Grant argues that the actual armed struggle was merely the crest of a giant wave that started in the factory commtitees and soviets. He explains that the insurrection was so limited precisely because 90% of the work had been done beforehand, and there was nobody willing to defend the old order from the final attack. 

Grant calls the naivety of the early revolution to our attention. Far from being a merciless bloodbath, he says, the workers actually let agents of the counter-revolution go free, as long as they promised to cease fighting. He says that it was only after the brutality of the counter-revolution was demonstrated that the workers realized the need for suppressing those forces with arms. 

Discussing the real relationship between the party and the class, Grant says that just as steam is organized by a piston box, the energy of the masses is organized by the party which gives direction to the masses' anger. Grant agrees with the idea that [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]], and argues that since the masses cannot stay poltiically mobilized forever, a party is needed to accelerate the development of the class struggle. In short, he agrees that [[The revolutionary party acts as a catalyst]]. 

## All power to the soviets!
Grant explains how the February revolution failed to accomplish any of the tasks of bourgeois revolution. Because of the [[combined and uneven development]] that Russia had gone through, Grant continues, the Russian capitalists were not revolutionary in any way, leaving the revolutionary tasks to the small but concentrated proletariat in the cities. 

To Grant, this means that the workers first had to secure the gains of a bourgeois revolution, and then moved on to socialist demands in the October revolution. Grant says this is a clear confirmation of the theory of [[permanent revolution]]. 

## The myth of the Constituent Assenbly
The myth that the Bolsheviks were only in favor of democracy before the revolution and disbanded it afterwards, Grant says, is one of the most persistent ones levied against the Bolsheviks. He explains that while the call for a Constituent Assembly was among the demands of the Bolsheviks, it was not as important as other demands, such as an end to the war and the transfer of power to the soviets. 

Grant argues that the slow processes of parliamentary democracy were eclipsed as instruments of the people by the soviets and factory committees. He says that the Constituent Assembly, initially thought by the Bolsheviks to be a method to mobilize the peasantry, became a focal point for the counter-revolution. 

Displaying the election results from the soviets between June and September 1917, Grant explains how the Bolsheviks went from 12% to 51%, as the middle collapsed and society polarized between the Bolsheviks on the left and the Cadets on the right. 

However, he underlines, this pattern was not evident in the elections to the Constituent Assembly, where the Bolsheviks only got 24% of the votes. He explains this by saying that the elections reflected the mood earlier in the year, when the peasantry hadn't yet witnessed the betrayals of the Right SR leadership. 

Explaining the immediate aftermath of the election, Grant says that the forces of reaction rallied behind the slogan of "All power to the Constituent Assembly." He says that the Bolsheviks are only guilty of choosing to prioritize the survival of soviet power when they dissolved the Constituent Assembly. 

If the Constituent Assembly was truly the voice of the people, Grant asks, why did nobody defend it when the Bolsheviks went to dissolve it? 

> [!note]
> I agree with Grant that [[The Constituent Assembly was unrepresentative of the Russian masses]]. 

Grant explains that the Bolshevik policy of land reform won over the peasantry and helped defeat the reactionaries in the civil war (25). 

Grant says that early on, opposition parties were allowed to organize, and it was only after the situation became more dire that the Bolsheviks began to suppress opposition (28). He says that this situation became even more dire upon foreign intervention (29).

Grant argues that [[Lenin]] always trusted in the masses, displaying his authenticity as a Marxist (28). He also says that the rumor of Lenin being a German agent is ludicrous, because it was actually the *Russian bourgeoisie* that was pro-German by the time Lenin arrived in Russia. I agree, [[Lenin was not a German agent]]. 

The author explains that the main defense of the Russian revolution was the solidarity of the international [[proletariat]] (32), underscoring how [[Internationalism is essential to the workers' movement]]. 

Grant argues that [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] demonstrated military genius in his creation of the Red Army on such short notice, and his successful campaigns against the Whites (33). 

Grant argues that the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] degeneration of the USSR stemmed from the terrible conditions that the [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]] faced (40).

The author says that while the Bolsheviks didn't intend to fully nationalize and militarize the economy, the civil war forced them to (41-42). 

Even during the civil war, Grant says, the Communist Party maintained free internal debate (42). 

During the 20s, Explaining the state of the soviet system, Grant says that de-proletarianization was occuring as workers fled the towns in search of food. He describes how in 1920, the working class was only 43% of its 1917 size (43-44).  

Grant says that during the 20s, the soviet system began to collapse under the weight of de-proletarianization and atomization of the working class (44).

During the 20s, Grant explains, the sailors at Kronstadt, who had once played a revolutionary role, mutinied and threatened the survival of the USSR. He argues that the Bolsheviks had no choice but to retake the garrison by force (46). 

During the 20s and after Kronstadt, Grant says, Lenin and the other Communist leaders accepted that the peasantry wasn't going to put up with much more. He says that they accepted a market in the buying and selling of grain, allowing a class of [[kulak|kulaks]] and NEPmen to emerge (47). 

Grant says Lenin even argued that the remaining workers in the factories had lost their proletarian class character, and were really draft dodgers and [[lumpenproletariat]] (49). 

Grant says during the time of the NEP, Lenin supported a *temporary* ban on internal factions in the CP. This, according to Grant, was a last ditch measure to prevent alien class forces from taking root in the Party as the NEPmen and Kulaks rose (49).  He notes that Lenin refused to alter the rules for elections to future Party congresses, revealing the temporary nature of the measure (50). 

Grant says that the opposition parties chose to side with the White Army and reaction, necessitating their suppression as a matter of course (51).

# 2. The rise of Stalinism
Grant argues that a workers' state is necessary, since no one country would have the economic and political might to fully eradicate all vestiges of class society while defending itself, meaning that a state would be required for some time (56). This supports the idea that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]]. However, this state, according to Grant, contains multiple tendencies. On one hand, it defends socialist property relations, but on the other it defends bourgeois norms of distribution, at least for a period. He says that this is the essential contradiction of the workers' state (59). I agree that [[Workers' states are contradictory]]. 

Grant notes that during Lenin's lifetime, the highest paid person was making no more than five times the pay of the lowest pay (64). 

Grant says that as the Civil War drew to a close, the influx of Party members represented a tide of careerism and alien class elements (67). 

Grant supports the argument that [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]]. He says that Lenin intended to gradually bring more and more workers into responsibility of running the state, but under the prevailing conditions of the 20s this was impossible and led to the use of leftover Tsarist elements (68). 

The author says that Lenin supported the independence of the trade unions, so that the working class could have a voice independent of the workers' state bureaucracy (71). 

Grant quotes Lenin's view that the cultural backwardness of the Russian masses made them succeptible to corruption by the feudal and capitalist elements the leaders of the masses came into contact with (73). He quotes Trotsky, who believed that the petty bourgeois and bureaucratic elements were emboldened by the demoralization of the proletariat, and began to feel themselves to be arbiters between the classes of Russia, and no longer the servants of the working class (78). 

Discussing the rise of Stalin personally, Grant explains how he was able to balance between the left and right factions to maintain his survival during the internal disputes (85). This seems like a common way to escape a conflict or backstab your way to power in general. It's like Bonapartism in miniature if you think about it. 

Continuing on the topic of Bonapartism, Grant addresses the question of why Trotsky didn't just take power with the Red Army. He says that Trotsky understood that such an action would lead straight to Bonapartism, and would likely accelerate the degeneration of the USSR (87). I think this is accurate, and it demonstrates that Trotsky never fell into an individualistic view of politics. Instead, as Grant continues, Trotsky and the Left Opposition understood that they lived or died with the Russian proletariat, and that only through them could the renewed revolution proceed (89). 

Turning to an explanation of the role of the individual, Grant explains that [[Marxism isn't deterministic]], and that it merely accepts that we don't choose the circumstances that we act within (90). I agree, and think it's useful to bring up [[The dialectic of freedom and necessity]]. As Marxists, true freedom is an understanding of our real position and role within the movement. 

# 3. From five-year plan to the purges
Grant explains that Lenin intended the collectivization of agriculture to take place gradually and volunarily, through the provision of machinery that would allow the peasantry to see the benefits of collectivization. Instead, he says, the bureaucracy was forced (by their irresponsible feeding of the kulaks and NEPmen) to forcibly collectivize millions of acres at gunpoint (94). I think it was this policy that really gave ammunition to anti-communists. It was never meant to be a war of extermination against resistance in the countryside, but good luck explaining the fine details. 

Grant quotes from Trotsky, whose language is really inspiring in the context of the defeat of the Left Opposition (99): 

> We  regret nothing and repudiate nothing. We are living with the same ideas and attitudes that moved us in the days of October 1917. We can see beyond these temporary difficulties. No matter how much the river bends, it flows to the ocean. 

Returning to the pay scale for Communist officials, Grant explains that the pay maximum was abolished in 1932 (102). To him, this is a clear reflection of the growing privledge of the bureaucracy and its infiltration into the Communist Party. 

On the international scale, Grant says, the efforts to purge "Trotskyism" from the Comintern resulted in lots of splits and confusion over the nature of the USSR. He says that some defined the USSR as "state capitalist" ([[Cliff called the USSR state capitalist]]) or another form of society altogether ([[Shachtman proposed the theory of bureaucratic collectivism]]) (103).

Grant begins an account of Soviet foreign policy during this time period. He says that this policy was a continuation of the Stalinist domestic policy, and betrayed internationalism, at first accidentally misleading the world workers' movement, later intentionally doing so (105). 

In Germany, for instance, Grant recounts how [[Zinoviev]] attempted to control the party by merely replacing the leaders with those loyal to the USSR's line at the time. However, he continues, this totally failed, and set a dangerous precendent (108, 110). This is one example how [[Organizational re-arrangement cannot solve political issues]]. 

Over in China, Grant explains how the Comintern advised the Chinese Communists to subordinate itself to the [[Kuomintang]] instead of pursuing a [[class independence|class-independent]] line, eventually culminating in the Shanghai Massacre (112). 

Grant underlines the mistaken "Third Period" policy of Stalin. He says that Stalin predicted the final crisis of capitalism, but argues that [[Capitalism has no final crisis]] that we can rely on to end it. He says that it will always claw its way out of crisis at the expense of the workers. Furthermore, he says that this policy led directly to the victory of [[fascism]], since he ordered German communists to struggle against "social fascism" in the [[SPD]], instead of fighting the [[Nazi Party]] (114). 

In order to gain bourgeois allies abroad, Grant explains, Stalin sought to establish friendly relations with [[France]] and [[UK|Britain]], and even the fascist [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. Eventually, he continues, Stalin dissolved the Comintern altogether as a peace offering (120). 

Critiquing the Stalinist policy of a worker-bourgeois alliance (the Popular Front), Grant says that Lenin and Trotsky established that the national bourgeois of colonial countries was too tied up with imperialism and too weak to play a revolutionary role. However, he continues, the Stalinists ignored this fact, choosing to subordinate the workers' movement to the demands of the "progressive" bourgeoisie (121). This is basically an overview of Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]]. 

Grant describes the first time the Stalin regime deliberately strangled a revolution - in [[Spain]]. He says that the workers attempted to take power time and again, despite their leaders in the CNT-FAI, the CP, and the POUM failing to provide an alternative to the bourgeois coalition government. He says that their leadership refused to follow through, dooming the country to fascism (122, 123). This is a clear example of how [[The crisis of our era is the lack of proletarian leadership]] and the fact that [[A revolution is all-or-nothing]]. 

Continuing, Grant describes how despite the fact that the [[POUM]] had been slandered as "Trotskyist" by the CP, they actually failed to take Trotsky's advice and all their gains turned to ashes because of their incorrect perspective (124). 

Grant explains how in revolutions, the morale and enthusiasm of the masses is the key indicator of success (125). I agree, and I think that because of this, [[Marxists seek to increase the clarity and confidence of the workers]] above all else. If we can raise the confidence of the working class, there is no force that will withstand their onslaught. 

Describing the violence of the Stalinist counter-revolution, Grant explains the Marxist attitude towards violence. He says that Marxists cannot avow violence in the abstract, and that [[Pacifism isn't revolutionary]]. Instead, he continues, Marxists must ask why violence is used, and against whom it is used, and for what reasons. He argues that the violence of Stalin's allies has nothing to do with the defense of the USSR that was needed during the civil war, which he approves of (130). 

Reflective of the anti-democratic purges and oppression of internal enemies, Grant explains, the Communist Party hadn't had a single Party Congress between 1939 and 1952 - despite the fact that during the darkest days of the civil war, the party had met annually. Furthermore, he continues, out of the 139 members of the Central Committee elected at the 17th Congress, Stalin and his allies had arrested 110 (83%), and out of Lenin's central committee of 1917, only *two* were still alive, [[Kollontai]] and Stalin (132). 

Turning to the military ramifications of the purges, the author explains that 90% of all generals and 80% of all colonels were executed by the secret police. He describes how there were extensive purges at all levels of the core military cadre, dramatically weakening the Red Army on the eve of [[WW2]] (140). 

Grant explains that later on, the bureaucracy under [[Khrushchev]] attempted to blame the purges on Stalin individually, absolving themselves. He notes that while some, like Bukharin, were "rehabilitated," Trotsky never was, since the bureaucracy had no use for his truly revolutionary ideas (146). 

Summarizing the fate and demise of the Comintern, Grant argues that Stalin and the bureaucracy viewed the workers' movements around the globe as nothing more than bargaining chips, and they traded them like any other commodity (148). Grant explains how Stalin finally dissolved the entire Comintern in 1948 in a show of good faith for his new friends in the UK, France, and USA (150). This is truly damning, and is one example of actions speaking louder than words. There's no possible justification for the outright dissolution of the international Communist organization. [[The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s]]. 

# 4. The nature of Stalinism
Grant explains why [[The workers must build their own state]] and cannot make use of the bourgeois state. He says that the institutions of the state are filled with bureaucrats, career soldiers, and police captains who have been traiend to defend the interests of the capitalists. He argues that while a workers' state may be forced to use many of these officials in the running of society, at least initially, they must be subordinated to new institutions of workers' democracy (152). I think that the failure to replace the Tsarist specialists and bureaucrats was a pivotal failure of the Russian revolution. 

The author outlines the fundamental necessity of revolution, saying that [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]]. Because of this, he continues, *eventually* the superstructure will be brought into alignment with the economic base of society. However, he notes that this happens *eventually,* and there can be long periods where the superstructure contradicts new economic relations, as in the reign of [[Napoleon]], where feudal forms were re-introduced atop a newly formed bourgeois economy. Nevertheless, Grant says, Marxists consider Napoleon's administration a *bourgeois* state, not a feudal one, due to those new property relations (153). 

Again, Grant explains that [[Workers' states are contradictory]] and that the USSR retained many elements of the old state structure, even while it was based on new property relations, similar to the administration of Napoleon (154). Furthermore, it's important to note that [[The Soviet bureaucracy was compelled to defend central planning]] in the face of capitalist threat.

In summarizing his outlook on the class nature of the Soviet Union, Grant says that while the workers suffered a political counter-revolution at the hands of the Stalinists, the economic forms of a workers' state remained (160). I think this point is absolutely essential in answering the question: [[What happened to the USSR?]] 

## What is Bonapartism?
Grant says that overall, the state apparatus has different interests from the ruling class, and can sometimes come into direct collision with the latter. He argues that the broad generalization that the state is a body of force is dangerous to simplify everything down to (161). I think this is a case of [[Nothing exists outside its context]]. 

Furthermore, he continues, there are even historical examples of the ruling class being politically or partially expropriated by the state apparatus, and remaining the ruling class. He gives China under [[Chiang Kai-Shek]] as an example (162). 

## Stalinism: a form of Bonapartism
Grant explains the absurdity of treating the bureaucracy as a ruling class. For one, he says, there were many layers of the bureaucracy so we can't say that they were all members of a united class any more than we can say that the President and a postal worker are in the same class (165). 

Grant counterposes control over production with that of distribution. He argues that the capitalists have control over the production process, while the bureaucracy had control over distribution, and it was this function that they fulfilled in Soviet society. Because of the fact that it didn't play a role in production, he continues, we ought to characterize it as a parasitic *caste* rather than *class* (168). [[The Soviet bureaucracy managed distribution, not production]]. 

Summarizing his stance, Grant says that the state is a glorified policeman, who can at times become unbridled. However, he continues, this does not elevate the policeman to the role of capitalist, slave master, or king. Grant sees evidence for this in how the Soviet bureaucracy has to hide its privileges from the workers (169). 

## 'Bureaucratic collectivism?'
Grant believes that [[The USSR wasn't bureaucratic collectivist]]. 

## Trotsky on 'state capitalism'
Grant argues that [[The USSR wasn't state capitalist]]. 

## 'A trade union in power'
...

## The theory of state capitalism today
Grant lambasts [[Tony Cliff]] and his followers for being unable to explain the events of the 90s. He notes that they said the move to privatize the Soviet economy was a "step sideways," neither good nor bad (184). 

# 5. From war to de-Stalinization
## Once again: the advantages of the planned economy
Grant tells us that Trotsky called for the defense of the USSR, and that [[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]]. He outlines the split in the [[SWP (USA)]] due to this question (190). 

Describing the cynical warming of relations with [[Hitler]], Grant explains how there was a censure of anti-fascist propaganda after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as well as the betrayal of communists and Jews into the hands of the Gestapo. Stalin even demolished some defensive infrastructure in eastern Europe, according to Grant, to win Hitler's favor (192-6). 

## Consequences of the purges
Grant outlines the dire state the Red Army was in, demonstrated by the disasterous attempt to invade Finland. At the outbreak of [[WW2]], he says, the Red Army was actually better armed than the German military, but its terrible tactics led to encirclement and the destruction of most of its strength. Grant blames their unreadiness on Stalin and his clique, who ignored signs that the Germans were preparing for attack (196). Fundamentally, [[Stalinism weakened the Soviet defense in WW2]]. 

# 'For the archives'
Sewell recounts that incredibly, there weren't even any plans for a defense of the USSR in case of German attack, and that Stalin ordered the Red Army to stand down for the first 2 days of the German advance, while the Soviet air force was bombed on the ground (200). 

## The tide turns
Despite this, Grant continues, the Soviet military won despite losing a massive advantage, along with their most productive areas. He sees a vindication of the planned economy in how the Soviets were able to come back from a defeat that would have lost the war for any bourgeois state (203). [[Soviet WW2 victory vindicated the planned economy]]. 

Furthermore, he says, the Soviets could have called on the German workers to rise up against the [[Nazi Party]], but instead, the war was waged on national chauvinist lines, with Ilya Ehrenburg announching "if the German workers meet us with red flags, they will be the first to be shot" (206). I wanted to find out who this person was, but there's no reference to this quote outside this book. 

## Stalin's manuvers
Grant argues that Trotsky was correct in predicting a revolutionary upswing at the end of the war, and says that this upsurge was headed off by the entrance of the Stalinists into bourgeois coalitions across Europe, and the efforts of the Labour Party in the UK. He explains that the masses looked up to the Stalinists due to their victory over fascism, but the Stalinists were more interested in placing the workers under their control than aiding genuine revolution (208). 

## Eastern Europe after the war
Grant tells us that the Stalinist post-war policy in Eastern Europe was initially one of "people's democracy" that built coalitions between the national bourgeoise, the workers, and the peasants, until a strong state controlled by Moscow could be built. Afterwards, he continues, the Stalinists expropriated the bourgeosie, and collectivized the peasantry, while keeping all workers' movements within their channels (211). 

## Victory in China
Grant explains that the victory of the peasantry in the Chinese revolution displayed a process where the peasants had taken up the historical task of the working class, and thus was bound to have big distortions from a 'standard' social revolution (213). 

He argues that such a process was only possible due to the impasse of Chinese capitalism, the decay of the national bourgeoisie, and the paralysis of world imperialism at the time. Despite the major steps forward, he argues, a second political revolution would be needed in order to place political power in the workers' hands (214). 

## From Stalin to Khrushchev
Discussing the tail-end of Stalin's administration, Grant says that despite low living standards, there was an optimistic attitude that was reflected in the birth rate and other factors. He explains how the USSR was able to rebuild from the devastation of WW2 in only five years (218).

Despite the general economic growth, Grant says, the gap between the average worker and the higher paid bureaucrats only widened. By this time, he says (quoting Medvedev), the ratio was somewhere around 1:50 or 1:00 if you included the free services available to bureaucrats (219). 

## Stalin's last purge
Grant explains that on the eve of a new purge that threatened to target Stalin's inner circle, driven by the latter's paranoia, he suddenly died. Grant implies he was murdered to prevent such an affair, and says that his death provoked a struggle within the bureaucracy that the reformers eventually won. The author explains that these reformers, [[Khrushchev]] among them, wanted to alleviate the pressure in Soviet society without allowing a revolutionary explosion (222).
