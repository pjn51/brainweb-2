The author begins by stating that she means to answer the question of how we can apply the [[Eightfold Path]] to our work lives as lay practitioners of [[Buddhism]]. She says that if we apply morality, concentration, and wisdom, we can share our metta and peace of mind with those around us, even as we practice non-Dharma work.

The author argues, based on some quotations about the definition of [[Right Livelihood]], that the [[Buddha]] prohibited only the classic five trades to his lay followers. She says that lay Buddhists are outright prohibited from violating any of the [[Five Precepts]] that lie at the foundation of [[Buddhist ethics]]. The author also points out that encouraging or enabling others to break a precept would also be forbidden. 

However, Jootla reminds us that the intention and context of an action have a large effect on the [[karma]] that the action creates. She gives the example of a doctor who administers antibiotics, not because he hates bacteria, but because he cares for the patient. 

Turning to wider society, the author says that we must find livelihood within the range of job opportunities that exist in our actual environment. To her, this means that we have to make some sacrifices. For example, she imagines an army officer who comes to the Dharma late in his career. She says that such a person would have the opportunity to practice wisdom and abide by Buddhist ethics when not engaged in combat.
