# Introduction
They report that First Nation living conditions in [[Canada]] are terrible, and that median income for natives on reserves is $14,000. 

# Rich and varied cultures thrived before colonization. 
They say that this represented [[primitive communism]]. 

# The rise of European capitalism as the driving force for colonization
The rise of European [[capitalism]], according to Fightback, was the driving force behind colonization of North America. They explain that the weakness of [[France]] prevented an outright genocide of natives. 

# More thefts and betrayals
They argue that the Hudson Bay company and others stole land and resources from the First Nations. 

# Canadian capitalism built on the subjugation of Indigenous peoples
The authors say that capitalism required sweeping Native practices and systems aside to allow for private ownership and profit. In order to accomplish this, they continue, Natives were confined to isolated reserves. 

# Unfair treatment and the Indian Act
The authors explain that the Indian Act was meant to standardize the management of and further dominate the Native population. A further intent, we are told, is to integrate the Native population into the capitalist system.

# The Riel Rebellions and their aftermath
The authors explain that there were many attempts to regain control and expel the colonizers. After the sale of the land on which the Metis nation lived, the article continues, the Metis organized a provisional government and rebellion which came to be known as the Red River Rebellion. 

The authors remark that the Canadian [[state]] embarked on a familiar path - pretending to negotiate while crushing the movement by force. 

The article underlines the emergence of a white-Native alliance between the Metis and some poor white settlers, who were pawns of the Canadian state and [[imperialism]]. 

# Residential schools: tools of cultural genocide
The article outlines how the preferred method of control used by the Canadian state was forced assimilation. 

# The White Paper
After totally crushing and marginalizing the Indigenous peoples, the article explains, the Canadian government of the 60s tried to absolve itself of all responsibility to the Native population by repealing the Indian Act and removing all legislation that targeted Native groups. While the authors say that the Indian Act was racist and horrible, they say it did afford Natives a few rights that Natives didn't want to give up. 

The article argues that the White Paper, as this act was called, was the final act of assimilating Native cultures into bourgeois Canadian society, opening the way for the privatization of all native reserves. 

The authors explain that Native leaders rejected the White Paper, and in British Columbia they formed the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) who wrote their own "Brown Paper." Because of this, they say, the White Paper was withdrawn in 1973. 

The authors explain that one of the first acts of a socialist Canadian government would be to repeal the Indian Act on the terms of Native people, without leaving them out in the cold to be ground into the gears of Canadian capitalism.

# From Red Power to today
Fightback outlines how the radicalism of the 60s was expressed in the Red Power movement - a movement with many different class outlooks. They say that at first, identity was the main factor, but a layer of the movement were pushed towards a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective and understood the need to find support outside the Indigenous population. 

The article mentions Howard Adams, who they say is the most well-known Indigenous activist. They quote him from his book, Prison of Grass:

> It is common practise of imperial governments to use middle-class native elites to provide support for their administration. Middle-class society, which shares the same value system and ideology as the ruling class, provides political stability for the capitalist system. Therefore, as soon as natives start action towards liberation, governments make serious efforts to bring native leaders into middle-class society. After these leaders are co-opted, they become supporters of the government and of the colonial rule that suppresses their people.

The authors say that Marxists such as these exposed a deep divide in the movement between [[proletariat|proletarian]] and [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] elements, whom sought reconciliation on the basis of capitalism. 

# Class divisions in the Indigenous community
The article explains that even though it was much more difficult for Natives to aquire [[capital]], a small capitalist class did emerge that sought to use their identities as a weapon to defend their class position. 

# Truth and reconciliation
The authors outline the various hollow and ineffective measures that the government has taken to "resolve" the disparity between Native and non-native communities. 

# UNDRIP and the sham of reconciliation
The commission, the article explains, proposed the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP. They say that this has considerable support among Natives, since it proposes native self-determination, autonomy, and other advances. 

However, Fightback notes, this can never, and will never be fully implemented under capitalism. Furthermore, they continue, the [[USA]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and Canda routinely vote against this declaration, demonstrating the hypocrisy of their governments and ruling classes. Their reason for opposition, the authors say, is that it would get in the way of resource extraction and might re-open land claims. 

# The bourgeois state and resource extraction
The article argues that only a socialist government could actually guarantee Native autonomy and informed consent about what was being done on their land.

# Class struggle methods for Indigenous liberation
The article clarifies that while Marxists are opposed to all racist attitudes and ideas, we understand that we have to fight racism and discrimination in the material world by changing the material conditions of oppressed peoples. 

In order to change those conditons, the article continues, we must engage in class struggle. The authors also argue that placing an emphasis on class struggle does *not* place other struggles on the back burner. 

They argue that there are enough resources for all in society to live a decent life, and the fact that white workers have more resources *doesn't* mean that Native workers must have less. Instead, they argue, the ruling class pits sections of the working class against one another intentionally. 

The article also highlights how [[Workers have natural solidarity]], with white workers instinctively supporting the struggles of Native workers. They call on the labor movement to become more involved in the Native liberation struggle, and for Indigenous workers and youth to reject reactionary and academic post-colonial theories that result only in isolation and defeat. 

# The need for convergence
The article calls for the convergence and insurgence of all oppressed and exploited peoples from across Canada and the world. They argue that a struggle against the ruling class requires the support of the entire working class. 

> The working class of North America will never be free so long as the Indigenous peoples of North America continue to be oppressed and subjugated. The only solution is the complete overthrow of capitalism and the dismantling of the Canadian state and confederation. A voluntary socialist union of peoples, based on genuine equality, the broadest workersâ€™ democracy, and common ownership of the means of production, would have no interest in the continued subjugation of the oppressed peoples.
