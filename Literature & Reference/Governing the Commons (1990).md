# Summary
This article is a critique of Hardin's concept of [[intro to ESCI#Tragedy of the Commons 1968|Tragedy of the Commons]] and an exploration of how communities can manage collective resources. The central question of this work is: [[How can we manage common resources?]]

The main idea is that the 'tragedy of the commons' scenario that Hardin outlines only happens under specific circumstances. It only happens when the resource isn't governed by the community, when the community doesn't recognize it as a shared resource and sets boundaries and rules to make sure the resource is sustained. 

The funny thing is that the original meaning of the word 'commons' was the English communal agricultural system under [[feudalism]]. Farmers would graze their livestock on a common land. Far from being unsustainable, this system was able to last hundreds of years without a decline in productivity. That's because the commons were managed with a set of rules of conduct for community members.

Ostrom criticizes the simplicity of [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]], and examines the situations of CPRs as a case of [[The prisoner's dillema]]. She also incorporates a study of [[The free-rider problem]]. Overall, she makes a central point that [[Individual rationality can lead to collectively irrational results]]. 

Ostrom says that examples of collective enterprises abound, and cites the example of law firms (p.25). 

Ostrom seems to slip into [[idealism]], arguing that if an explanation of how self-government can occur is created, then policy decisions may change (p.25). This presumes the role of the state as a neutral observer standing over society, when in reality, [[States are instruments of class domination]]. The ruling class would never allow meaningful and empowered expressions of community self-government. 

Ostrom adopts [[Hobbes]]' theory of the state put forward in [[Levithian (1651)]] (p.41). [[Ostrom calls "Levithian or privatization" a false dichotomy]]. [[Ostrom critiques Levithian as CPR manager]]. 

Discussing the case study of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] village of Torbel, Ostrom cites Netting's analysis of land ownership systems. She says that the latter found that communal ownership was better suited to land under five conditions: low productivity per square foot, variable yield, low potential for improving the land, large spaces needed for functionality, and large groups needed for use (p.63).  

Continuing on the theme of ownership, Ostrom notes that Swiss alpine villages generally privately own land for agriculture, and communally own summer meadows, forests, and stony "waste lands" - with common land composing 80% of the total (p.64). 

Summarizing common features of well-managed CPRs so far, Ostrom explains that across case studies, appropriators self-govern (p.64-65). I think this is worth abstracting - [[Sustainability requires self-government]].
