> In his masterpiece on the [[Russia|Russian]] revolution, [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] gives a detailed analysis of the processes of revolution. Not to be confused with his earlier, shorter work, [[History of the Russian Revolution to Brest-Litovsk (1918)]]. 

# Preface
Trotsky explains that it is the lag of consciousness behind events that gives rise to the explosive situation of a revolution, where the conscsiousness of the masses rapidly snaps forward to the current conditions (p.xvi). [[Human consciousness is conservative]], and [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]]. 

He also says that the relationship of the leadership to the class is that of the piston box to steam. While the steam provides the energy for the engine and ultimately causes motion, the piston box directes and concentrates that energy (p.xvi). 

# 1. Pecularities of Russian development
Trotsky traces the material factors that caused the Russian state and society to develop in such a peculiar way, a combination of eastern and western features. He notes that [[Social development is always uneven]], and this was reflected in the fact that when Russia imported the technical advancements from elsewhere, Russia's leapfrogged over the intermediate stages that western Europe went through, leading to a very uneven social landscape (p.4). 

Trotsky argues that the development of the Russian [[bourgeoisie]] was affected by these factors as well. He says that there were little intermediate layers between the workers and peasants and the big bourgeoisie, and that the foreign composition of the capital in Russia meant that the national bourgeosie was more dependent on foreign interests and the state (p.8). He says that the national bourgeoisie were unable to lead the proletariat due to the latter's developed character, and couldn't lead the peasantry due to the former's dependence on the landlords and the state (p.9). Here, I can see the inklings of Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]].
