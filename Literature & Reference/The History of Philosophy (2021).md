# Summary
This is a book by [[Alan Woods]] that seeks to trace the development of [[philosophy]] from the dawn of humanity to [[Marx]], while using the method of [[dialectical materialism]]. 

---
# Accident and necessity
Woods quotes [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]], who says that a leader really reflects the relations between people, their combined interests and needs, rather than a personality (275). To him, this reflects the relationship between accident and necessity - the necessity of having a leader is reflected by the more-or-less accidental nature of the rise of any individual leader. 

# Christianity
Woods argues that while [[Christianity]] initially reflected a revolutionary impulse from the most oppressed, it was adopted by the ruling class and further fossilized after the Council of Nicea. He says that from then on, it was an extremely reactionary force. [[Religious movements tend to start as revolutionary and end as repressive]], and in this case,[[Nicea institutionalized Christianity]]. 

# Common sense
Woods says that common sense relies heavily on impression, and is good enough to work most of the time. However, he criticizes it, saying that it insufficient beyond certain limits. He says that the dialectical method is the opposite of this process (258). 

# Contradiction
Woods agrees with [[Hegel]] that contradictions lie at the heart of reality, and cannot be avoided (270). 

# Epistemology
Woods urges us not to confuse things that we do not know with things we cannot know (237). Throughout the book, he examines the ideas of the Empiricists, Kant, Spinoza, Hegel, and others' ideas about knowledge. 

# Equilibrium
Woods talks about how equilibriums were once supposed the be the natural state of the world, but as science develops, we're seeing that [[Change is omnipresent]] and equilibrium is rare. He says that this is in line with the predictions of the dialectical method (273). 

# Form and content
Woods discusses [[The contradiction of form and content]], using a flower in a pot as an example (272). 

# Islam
Woods says that the [[Islam|Islamic]] world kept the flame of learning alive as Europe descended due to Christianity. He traces the similarities between the development of Christianity and Islam, but says that there was more room for scientific inquiry in the latter faith. He explains that this was reflected in the scientific advances made by the Islamic world, and the ease in which they conqured [[Spain]]. However, he continues, this region was crushed by the Crusades. 

# Objective and subjective factors
Woods credits Marxism for the fact that [[Marxism isn't deterministic]] - he says that we must emphasize both the objective and subjective factors of thought and human activity. He says that the objective factors were best explained by the vulgar materialists, and that it was the idealists such as Hegel who examined the subjective factor sufficiently (302). 

# Social progress
Woods argues that this process is a contradictory series of stages which is constantly interrupted, with periods of rapid developement and periods of stagnation (256). He also says that [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]] and fails to raise the level of culture and the productive forces (277). 

# Unity of opposites
Woods explains that [[Opposites require each other]], and opposing phenomena are actually inseperable and rely on one another for their identity (268). 

# Quantity and quality
Woods criticizes attempts to reduce qualitative aspects to base quantities, a process known as *reductionism.* He says that in reality, nothing consists of a pure quantity, just as nothing exists of a pure quality, He agrees with Hegel that we must examine the unity of these two sides (267). He explains how [[Quantity transforms into quality]].

# Ancient Greeks
Woods says the Greeks were the first dialecticians. 

# Aristotle
[[The law of identity is the foundation of formal logic]], first formulted by Aristotle. Discussing [[Aristotle]], Woods says that the Christian Church later warped Aristotle's ideas, making him into less of a dialectician, seeing as in reality [[Aristotle criticized idealism]]. However, we still see that [[Woods criticizes Aristotle's ideas]]. 

# Plato
[[Woods views Platonic philosophy as a regression]] from Aristotle back into idealism. He says this regression took place because of the unstable state of Greek society. Woods notes that Plato thought that humans and reality were reflections of universal archetypes, and that we had to use reason to access these archetypes. Because of this, [[Plato was an idealist]]. 

# Saint Augustine
Woods says that he was the most prominent philosopher of the Dark Ages, who agreed with Plato about the existence of ultra-real archetypes, but thought that it was *faith* rather than reason that we could use to gain knowledge of them. The author says that this was elaborated in the trend of Realism. 

# Abelard
Woods explains that the school of Nominalism, led by Abelard, rose to challenge Augustinian Realism. He says that Abelard viewed all things as combinations of the universals of air, wind, water, and fire. Notionalism, Woods continues, would go on to challenge the existence of all universal notions (outside of human minds). 

# Aquinas
Woods explains that as Augustinian thought declined, Aristotle's ideas re-entered the mainstream. As a result of this, he says, thinkers like Aquinas attempted to salvage the Platonic underpinnings of Augustine by fusing them to Aristotle's ideas. 

# Galileo
Woods says that Galileo was the most accomplished scientist of the Renaissance. 

# Locke
Woods says that [[Locke]] and other Empiricists viewed the human mind as a blank slate upon which sense perceptions were imprinted (233). Later thinkers criticized this, saying that thought was an active process of interpretation and reorganization of information. 

# Leibniz
Woods argues that [[Leibniz]], who challenged the dualist views of [[Spinoza]], was an objective idealist who nevertheless developed dialectics (227). Instead, Woods continues, Leibniz viewed the world as constructed out of monads, of which there were an infinite variety. In each monad, we are told, Leibniz saw the universe reflected in miniature, which pre-empted the dialectical conception of particular and universal (228). However, Woods says that the "brilliant flashes" of Leibniz didn't really amount to a coherent new philosophy (231). 

# Kant
Woods views the ideas of [[Kant]] as a dead end. He explains that Kant sought to resolve the roadblocks faced by past philosophers via a solution to the question of how knowledge is obtained (232). Kant viewed thought, he continues, as an active rather than a passive process, and the mind as *anything but* a blank slate, as Locke had described it (233). Kant thought, Woods elaborates, that we can never know the nature of *things-in-themselves,* limiting our access to true knowledge (237). Kant distinguished between *understanding,* as the basic intake of sensory data, and *reason,* as the analysis of this data, the breaking of the data down and the building of it up again. For this, he adopted the dialectic, and Woods says that the chief achievement of Kant was the re-introduction of the dialectic to its rightful place in philosophy (240). Woods concludes that Kant's great achievement was his criticism of existing logic, but his main flaw was his subjectivist position on knowledge (245, 271). 

# Hegel
Woods explains that Hegel criticized Kant's ideas around thought. Hegel said, we are told, that knowledge can be only gained through activity. He viewed Kant's attempts to analyze thought as a tautology (238). Woods also says that Hegel was the first to elaborate that [[Opposites require each other]] and identity presupposes difference (242). Behind the idealist smoke, Woods interprets Hegel's ideas as a real revolution in thought. He cites Herzen (a Russian radical democrat), who said that Hegels' dialectic was "the algebra of revolution" (249). However, Woods argues that Hegel attempted to force this dialectic into an idealist straitjacket, causing his work to be very hard to read and introducing errors (252). One example of this, Woods explains, is the "absolute Idea," which Hegel sees as the culmination of thought and human progress, contradicting his dialectic, which criticizes the static idea of final destinations (282-283). 

Woods says that Hegel solved the mind-body problem by positing the activity of thinking as a bridge between the two (255). 

The author explains that after Hegel's death, the Hegelian community split into right and left wings. The right wing sought, we are told, to apply the weak, idealist side of Hegelianism in order to combat materialism and aid in reaction (288). 

The left wing, he continues, was comprised of thinkers who wanted to apply Hegel's ideas to broader topics like religion and culture (289). However, Woods points to their refusal to decisively break with idealism as their main limitation (291). 

# Stirner
 [[Stirner]], Woods explains, was one of these thinkers who failed to break with idealism. Instead, he rejected religion and developed the theory of "radical egoism," which was one of the founding texts of [[Anarchism]] (292). 

# Feuerbach
Woods credits [[Feuerbach]] as the only Left Hegalian who was brave enough to move in a materialist direction (292). However, he criticizes Feuerbach for his standpoint of individualism, viewing humans as isolated subjects rather than social creatures (294) and for rejecting Hegel's dialectical method (295).  

# Marx and Engels

# 7. The Renaissance
Woods describes how revolutionary this period was, the period in which the spiritual and philosophical dictatorship of the Church was cast off by a whole section of Europe, the bourgeoisie spurred the development of art, science, and technology, and the class struggle moved into life with the Peasants' War. 

Woods explains how heliocentric ideas were re-introduced to Europe from the Greeks, and how Copernicus chose to publish a book on the subject on his deathbed, in order to avoid persecution from the Church. He says that Kepler expanded and clarified this theory, adding more laws that prefered scientific accuracy to the idealist notion that the universe was a perfect and harmonious order. 

## Galileo
Woods explains how Galileo was probably the most accomplished scientist of the era, utilizing the telescope to investigate the heavens for the first time. He says that the Church has attempted to escape the blame for his persecution, as well as that of other scientists, but we can clearly see that the Church overtly silenced Galileo, as well as outright killing other scientists of the time.

Woods discusses the advent of English materialism, which he calls [[empiricism]]. He says that the biggest proponent was Francis Bacon, who chose not to directly fight against orthodoxy, but whose philosophy didn't include any religious content whatsoever. Bacon, Woods continues, reacted with scorn and disgust to the idealist content of the orthodox Schoolmen, saying that human ideas were mere reflections of a material world that didn't correspond with the dogmas of the Church and orthodoxy. Woods notes that Bacon concluded that heat is a form of motion, a startlingly modern conception. 

Woods also discusses the limitations of Bacon's empiricism, saying that it one-sidedly refused to use deduction, preferring only to use induction to arrive at conclusions. He says that dialectical materialism views induction and deduction not as incompatible, but as "different aspects of the dialectical process of cognition." Empiricists, Woods continues, thought that they could set out from the immidiate facts without any preconceptions, but Woods argues that we all begin analysis with a worldview already in our heads, and therefore, it's critical that we examine our preconcptions, else we will inevitably repeat the dominant worldview of our time, as the empiricists did. 

Woods cites Hegel's ridicule of historians who thought they provided an air of objectivity, and a quote from Bertrand Russel about the difficulty of creating hypotheses. 

> [!note]
> I'm pretty sure this is the same Bertrand Russel quote that's featured in [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance (1999)]]. 

Woods concludes this section by saying that the narrow dogmatic empiricism that emerged here has still been holding thought back to this day, particularly in the [[UK]] and [[USA]]. He says that the results of this advance are contradictory - empiricism spurred scientific advancement forward while holding philosophy back in many ways. 

## The age of immutability
The advancement of scientific technique, Woods explains, allowed scientists to categorize and classify the natural world as never before, but also encouraged a static way of looking at the world, a way that Engels would later term "the metaphysical mode of thought."

The author explains the life and times of [[Hobbes]], who was an English monarchist who experienced the English Revolution firsthand. Hobbes' ideas, the author continues, especially his materialist view of the state in [[Levithian (1651)]], aroused the ire of the state. 

Woods credits Hobbes as a strong materialist, but says that the latter held a mechanical view of the world, and was a step back from Bacon in that way. Finishing out this section, Woods turns to [[Locke]], who he says was the ultimate "common sense" philosopher, who declared experience to be the sole source of ideas. 

## The advance of science
Woods lays out the advances of the period after the end of the 17th century: dramatic advances in science and technology, heralded by Issac Newton, born 1642. However, he says, these were still empiricists who lacked some flexibility. 

## The invention of calculus
Woods outlines the controvery caused by [[calculus]]. He says that it used infentisimal quantities to measure motion and growth, sparking debate due to classical logic's limitations. Classical logic, as Woods described before, has an inability to deal with contradiction, and Woods says that motion *is* contradiction and remarks that it's no wonder such a mathematical advance caused skepticism from the base empiricists. 

Woods notes the various ways that the advance of science came up against an outdated way of thinking: here with calculus, and again later with the discovery that light functions both as a particle and wave. He says that while the Newtonian worldview was able to explain a lot, it imparted a very static and rigid view of the world, where change wasn't really a central part to anything.

## The decadence of empiricism
While the ideology of Bacon represented the hope of the Rennaisance, Woods says, the later ideas of empiricism reflected a situation in which the bourgeoisie was attempting to consolidate power. In England, Woods describes how Cromwell crushed the left wing of the British revolution, and after his death the English bourgeoisie invited the monarch back into the picture as a way to stabilize the situation. He explains that the ideas of empiricism no longer had any revolutionary potential, reflecting the same process occuring in the now-dominant bourgeoisie. 

Woods introduces Berkely, who he says attempted to defend religion by utilizing the weak sides of empiricism. According to Woods, Berkely started with Locke's proposition that all information arrives through our perception, and moved on to the idea that things only exist when we are percieving them. In order to give God a more central role, Woods elaborates, Berkeley said that while we may not percieve a given thing at all times, God is percieving everything and thus the whole universe does exist, in the mind of God. 

Woods dissects Berkeley's ideas, saying that the process of experimentation demonstrates that the material world does indeed exist independently of our perceptions, and that our perceptions are nothing more than reflections of this real world. In short - [[The material world exists]]. However, he says, this didn't stop Berkeley from denying all sorts of scientifically verified facts, and it doesn't stop the people who Woods calls descendants of these ideas: the logical positivists and linguistic philosophers. 

In our modern day, Woods elaborates, Berkeley has more followers than ever before. There are even many scientists, he says, that argue in a similar vein. However, he notes, a philosophy that cannot describe the world, and cannot improve our control over the world, has no real value, and represents a dead end in thought. 

## The end of the road
Woods explains that this dead end ended with [[Hume]]. He thought, we are told, that there was no way to demonstrate causality, only that one event preceded another. 

Woods explains the serious issues with this view, including the total death of science, and the plunging of humanity back into the dark ages. Luckily, he says, nobody really lives by this philosophy, since it's conclusions are absolutely absurd. Howerver, in his view it does have a seriously negative effect on scientific inquiry both into the natural world and into thought itself.
