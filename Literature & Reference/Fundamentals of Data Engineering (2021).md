# 1. Data engineering described
The authors say that we must first answer the question, [[What is data engineering?]] They explain that there are many answers. 

The authors argue that [[The DE lifecycle has distinct phases]]. They argue that data engineers should focus on the lifecycle of data needs, rather than specific technologies as those tend to change rapidly. 

Finally defining [[data engineering]], the authors say...

> _**Data engineering**_ is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A _**data engineer**_ manages the data engineering lifecycle beginning with ingestion and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.

The authors introduce the concept that [[Data science has a hierarchy of needs]], and say that since most data scientists spend the bulk of their time doing basic data processing, companies need to build a solid basis in this work if they want to tackle AI and [[deep learning]] tasks at the tip of the pyramid.  

Moving on to the data field, the authors make the claim that [[A firm's data maturity determines role of DE]].
