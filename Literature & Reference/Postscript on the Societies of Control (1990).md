> [!Abstract]
> In this article, [[Deleuze proposed the society of control]] and argues that the experience of corporate first-world workers represents a shift in the nature of oppression, from the prior disciplinary societies described by Foucault. He questions the ability of unions and traditional methods of struggle to adapt to new conditions.

# 1. Historical
Deleuze begins by introducing the idea of *disciplinary societies.* [[Foucault]] located these in the 18th and 19th centuries, and said they reached their height in the 20th. These systems, he continues, consisted of successions of "closed environments" where one passed from the family, to the school, to the factory, perhaps to the prison or hospital, etc. Deleuze explains that the individual never left a controlled environment that had a set of rules governing conduct (p3). 

Deleuze explains Foucault's analysis of the purpose of such environments of "enclosure." He says they sought to organize people in space and time in order to make production more efficient, and that Foucault also said that these spaces were historically contingent, and the purposes of these spaces changed as society transitioned from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]] (p3). 

Deleuze says that we're facing a crisis in relation to the environments of enclosure. Everyone, according to Deleuze, knows that these institutions are finished, regardless of the many promised reforms to such environments that are proposed again and again. These institutions are only being maintained in order to allow for the "installation of the new forces," according to the author (p3). 

Deleuze terms these new forces "societies of control" which are replacing the disciplinary societies. He says that within each of these regimes, liberating and enslaving forces are confronting each other, and that there is no need to fear or hope, but only to look for new weapons (p3). 

# 2. Logic
Deleuze defines the different "internments" through which we pass as independent variables. On the other hand, he says that control mechanisms are *inseperable variations,* which rely on a numerical langauge. Enclosures are defined as molds, and controls are defined as a modulation (p3). 

Deleuze provides an example, comparing the historical factory enclosure with the modern corporate "society of control." In the factory, each individual was confined by a uniform set of rules. Workers were on one hand and bosses on the other. Each worker recieve the same rate of pay. In contrast, the modern office modulates salaries, treating each worker as an isolated case (p4).

Deleuze notes that in the factory, individuals were constituted as a single body for the purposes of production. This was an advantage to the bosses but also to the [[unions]], which formed a mass resistance to the bosses. But the corporation prefers to incite competition between workers, modulating salary according to "merit" (p4).  

According to Deleuze, in the same way that the corporate office has replaced the factory, *perpetual training* is replacing the school. Additionally, *perpetual control* replaces the examiniation as the control mechanism for individuals (p4). 

I disagree that the corporate office structure has *replaced* the factory in any way, but this seems like an interesting analysis of the structure of the corporate office nevertheless. 

Deleuze contrasts the experience of transitioning between disciplinary societies with the moden experience of continuous control. In the past, one was always starting fresh in each new institution, but nowadays one is never really done with anything and we can never draw a firm line between one stage and another. 

I lose the thread here a little bit, with Deleuze talking about how we're moving from a *signature-numeration* format to a *password-watchword* format for keeping track of people. He also talks about how the judicial system is changing due to this process. He ties in monetary policy to this, saying that the society of control is no longer bound by the gold standard like the disciplinary society was (p4). 

Deleuze turns to the topic of markets and capitalism. He says that "capitalism is no longer involved in production...It no longer buys raw materials and no longer sells the finished products; it buys the finished products or assembles parts. What it wants to sell is services and what it wants to buy is stocks" (p5).  

This is fucking wacky. What?

Deleuze goes on to say that capitalism is now essentially dispersive, and the factory has given way to the corporation. "Man is no longer man enclosed, but man in debt."

# 3. Program
Deleuze discusses the author Felix Guattari's idea that the future could consist of a system where everyone has a keycard that permits access to certain areas of the world. This keycard could be rescinded at any moment (p6). 

Deleuze discusses the various ways that hospitals, prisons, and other classical societies of discipline are transitioning to the more flexible societies of control (p6). 

The author says that understanding examples like this help us understand "the crisis of the institutions" and the "progressive and dispersed installation of a new system of domination." He says that a key question here is whether or not the unions will adapt to be able to fight in this environment, or if new forms of struggle will be needed (p6). 

Deleuze ends this article by asking a bunch of questions (p6), which is an annoying habit found in the [[academy]], in my opinion. [[Asking questions without proposing an answer is annoying]]!

# My thoughts
Overall, I think this article is very navel-gazey and not concrete whatsoever. Deleuze totally hones in on capitalism in Europe and the [[USA]] in particular, ignoring the fact that, as a world system, capitalism has not "replaced" the factory whatsoever. Furthermore, the majority of [[USA|American]] workers don't exist in the type of corporate office environment that he is describing. 

Yes, the new technologies of control no longer necessitate rigid categorization of *some* workers, and those categorizations *do* help the formation of solidarity and [[class consciousness]], but the shifts we are seeing do *not* necessarily mean that some type of "new system" is upon us. 

Overall, Deleuze seems to be a little narrow-minded in his assertion that the life of an American white collar office worker represents some kind of tectonic shift in the material basis of capitalism or something.
