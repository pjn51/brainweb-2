# Summary
This book, written by [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]], is an analysis of the degeneration of the USSR under the Stalinist bureaucracy, leading to a state of proletarian [[Bonapartism]]. It is an important part of the theory of [[Trotskyism]]. 

This book reveals Trotsky's real stance towards the USSR, which is nothing like the caricature that he was anti-Soviet. 

The main idea is that [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]]. 

# Introduction
Most of what was written about the Soviet Union during the early days was bullshit, and not scientific. 

The purpose of this book is to provide such a scientific account of what is really going on. 

“The hostility to criticism of the majority of the official “friends” really conceals a fear not of the fragility of the Soviet Union, but of the fragility of their own sympathy with it. We shall tranquilly disregard all fears and warnings of this kind. It is facts and not illusions that decide. We intend the face and not the mask.” 

# CHAPTER 1: WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED
### 1. The Principal Indices of Industrial Growth
The bourgeoisie in Russia was too backward and small to carry out the tasks of democracy. Therefore, the work fell to the proletariat to carry out the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. 

Trotsky says that Russia could not develop further on a capitalist basis. *Why does he say this? Is it because Russia is subject to the confines of [[imperialism]]?*

The failure of the international revolution to arrive is very bad, but also reveals the strength of even an isolated planned economy. The growth of the USSR dwarfed the rest of Europe during this period. This growth proves the victory of socialism, “not in the language of dialectics, but in the language of steel, cement, and electricity.”

Each capitalist country has the same economic system, but very different levels of development. Even within a country there are different levels of development. This is the law of uneven and combined development. When an underdeveloped region begins to develop, it can skip the productive stages of more advanced regions, by adopting the cutting edge of technologies used in those other regions. 

### 2. Comparative Estimates of These Achievements
Even while growth is at a high level, the USSR is growing from a low state, while other European countries are at a much higher level of development. 

Capitalism was still far ahead of Soviet abilities, shown by the productivity of [[labor]] and the prices of consumer goods at the time.

Rapid growth of industry lends itself to some issues. New technology is difficult to introduce, and new techniques take time to be understood by management and workers. This leads to high production costs and poor quality as these processes unfold. 

55% of agricultural machinery is broken at any given time, and transportation costs are far higher than in the rest of Europe. 

### 3. Production per capita of the Population
The average individual output of labor is very low compared to the developed world. 
Wherever we look, the USSR is lagging far behind the rest of Europe and the [[USA|United States]]. 

“The fundamental evil of the capitalist system is not the extravagance of the possessing classes, however disgusting that may be in itself, but the fact that in order to guarantee its right to extravagance the bourgeoisie maintains its private ownership of the [[means of production]], thus condemning the economic system to anarchy and decay.”

We shouldn’t despair too much about the backwardness of Russia compared to [[France]] or Germany, since Russia without socialism would be more like Estonia or Poland than it would be like France or Germany, and the USSR is miles beyond the rest of Eastern Europe. 

## CHAPTER 2: ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ZIGZAGS OF THE LEADERSHIP
### 1.Military Communism”, the “New Economic Policy” (NEP) and the Course Toward the Kulak
Military communism was needed to regiment production in what was essentially a besieged society. 

The NEP was needed to revive industry by reconnecting the urban economy with the dispersed rural peasant enterprises which were very resistant to inclusion in a planned economy. 

The redistribution of land to the peasants hastened the development of the kulak class of petty landowners. 

Stalin floated the idea of denationalizing agricultural land and giving 40 year leases to the kulaks. 

The Left Opposition wanted to continue the path of industrialization, but the ruling group thought this was too risky, and the kulaks strongly opposed this of course. 

The first Five Year Plan was very timid. It had the state budget at a lower percentage of national income than the Czarist one! This was due to a lack of vision by the Politburo, and ironically the Politburo would later accuse the planners of treason for their low goals. 

### 2. A Sharp Turn: “Five-year Plan in Four Years” and “Complete Collectivization”
"Irresoluteness before the individual peasant enterprises, distrust of large plans, defense of a minimum tempo, neglect of international problems – all this taken together formed the essence of the theory of “socialism in one country”, first put forward by Stalin in the autumn of 1924 after the defeat of the proletariat in Germany." 

As the kulaks withheld their grain due to an unprofitable situation, the Politburo claimed they were acting on purely political motives and were hostile to socialism. 

The party vacillated between supporting the kulaks and giving in to their demands, and trying to eradicate them as a class. 

After exiling the left wing of the party, Stalin adopted their economic policy of industrialization and attacked the right wing. A classic example of proletarian bonapartism.

The press discovered (or was instructed to discover) that kulaks were dominating not only the peasant economy, but local communist party structures. 

A program of increased grain seizure developed quickly into a program of liquidating the kulaks altogether. This showed that the party was making things up as they went along, with no clear outlook on the situation. 

This was followed by an intense campaign of collectivization, which was adventuristic because there wasn't enough machinery to really take advantage of large scale farming. Also, rumors that all property was to be seized terrified the peasantry into selling all their cattle or slaughtering it. Collectivization could have been carried through in a rational, democratic manner, but the way it was rushed absolutely devastated the rural economy which was already in a bad place. 

During this time, an attack by a capitalist power would likely have toppled the regime. However, no attack came and the regime survived. 

There really wasn’t a way out of this situation without a world revolution. Socialism was impossible in Russia alone. The best case scenario was really staving off bureaucratization and a return to capitalism. This meant that the only way forward would have been to focus on industrializing the country as fast as possible while making sure the approach was balanced, and praying for the German workers’ movement to get its shit together.

It’s easy to overlook the role of the cultural level of the population. Here in the US, the average intellectual level of a worker is easily capable of being trained to oversee basically any enterprise, but that was not the case in the USSR at this time. Most people had no experience working in even rudimentary business structures, or in managing anything. This is one reason collectivization was so difficult. 

## CHAPTER 3: SOCIALISM AND THE STATE
### 1.The Transitional Regime
Marxist theory posits that the higher stage of communism will arrive when the productive forces are at such a high level that property is no longer a useful construct and the state is no longer needed. 

To say that socialism is present, three criteria must be met: economic planning, workers democracy, and very high productivity of labor. With this in mind, the USSR is certainly not a socialist country, and is in a preparatory stage before socialism. 

It is true that eventually the productive forces would develop into socialism in the Soviet Union, but eventually is not inevitably. Social contradictions produce social antagonisms that have a life of their own. There is no guarantee that the development of the productive forces would be a linear process. 

### 2.Program and Reality
Basically a recap of Lenin’s State and Revolution.

The Soviet state has no signs of withering away, and the bureaucracy has no intention of allowing this to happen. Instead, they have cemented their control using the same structures as the former Czarist state. Wasn’t the withering of the state theorized to happen after world revolution? There still needs to be an armed body to defend against foreign invasion. 

The Red Army’s democratic structure has once again given way to a privileged officers’ caste above the enlisted soldiers, as it was before the Revolution. 

### 3.The Dual Character of the Workers’ State
In order for the state to disappear, the struggle to survive must disappear. The socialization of the means of production doesn't guarantee this fact. This means that there must be some organization with the task of increasing the productive power, and this task naturally falls to the state. The most logical way of increasing production is the use of labor payment worked out under capitalism. 

Lenin said that in the transition between capitalism and communism, there may end up being “a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie” and this is what the USSR was. The state still defended inequality. 

This means that the Soviet state had a dual character. On one hand, it was socialistic in that it defended social property relations. But on the other hand, it also distributed goods along capitalistic lines and defended elite privilege. Because of these internal contradictions, it’s important to study which way the state is moving - towards or away from socialism. 

“For the defense of “bourgeois law” the workers’ state was compelled to create a “bourgeois” type of instrument – that is, the same old gendarme, although in a new uniform.” Basically, the armed workers themselves were not interested in preserving the bourgeois elements of the new Soviet state, meaning that the USSR was compelled to go further in the bourgeois direction. 

As long as genuine equality is impossible, it is inevitable that a bourgeois state will calcify around the privileged minority. 

### 4.”Generalized Want” and the Gendarme
“A development of the productive forces is the absolutely necessary practical premise [of Communism], because without it want is generalized, and with want the struggle for necessities begins again, and that means that all the old crap must revive.” - Marx
Marx never developed this concept, because he didn't think a proletarian revolution would happen in a country that wasn't developed by capitalism first. Not only had Russia failed to raise living standards and productivity, the situation of the average person had gotten much worse after the Revolution than before. 

There was a dire need for specialists to come from abroad, but they demanded higher standards of living than the average worker. The democratic apparati of the Soviets started to hinder economic needs for specialists, because workers wouldn't agree to exploit themselves in order to allow for comfort for foreign workers. 

### 5.The “Complete Triumph of Socialism” and the “Reinforcement of the Dictatorship”
The political outlook of the party and the ComIntern is confused. They talk about the final triumph of socialism, but also about the need to reinforce the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. They fail to understand the basic Marxist tenet that the root of every social organization is the productive forces, and the productive forces in the Soviet Union are not capable of bringing about a socialist organization of society. 

## CHAPTER 4: THE STRUGGLE FOR PRODUCTIVITY OF LABOR
### 1. Money and Plan
If the development of socialism was going according to plan, we ought to see the state and the power of money begin to decrease in importance. 

This trend would not be forced or arbitrarily executed, but would instead begin naturally as the need for the state and the need for money disappeared. 

An economic plan ought not to be gospel, but more of a working hypothesis that should be revised often when new information presents itself. 

“For the regulation and application of plans two levers are needed: the political lever, in the form of a real participation in leadership of the interested masses themselves, a thing which is unthinkable without Soviet democracy; and a financial lever, in the form of a real testing out of a priori calculations with the help of a universal equivalent, a thing that is unthinkable without a stable money system.”

The Soviet money system was weakened since it didn't rely on gold. Therefore, it struggled in the international market.

### 2. Socialist Inflation
During the first Five Year Plan, inflation increased rapidly as the state doubled the [[currency]] in circulation.

By manipulating the currency, the bureaucracy deprived itself of a very useful tool for telling which areas of the economy were not working correctly. 

### 3. The Rehabilitation of the Ruble
The bureaucracy was treating prices as a purely administrative decision, and wasn't accounting for the amount of labor-time going into each product when setting prices. 

>“[Prices] will serve the cause of socialism better, the more honestly they begin to express the real economic relations of the present day.”

While it wasn't feasible for the ruble to go back to the gold standard, an increase in the gold reserves of the state would provide some much-needed stability to the currency.

### 4. The Stakhanov Movement
All economies are fundamentally an economy of time. Time is a resource without which the development of culture and society are not possible. In order to succeed in its historical tasks, socialism must abolish exploitation and raise the economy of time to new heights.

The return of piecework payment was not a retreat to capitalism, but an abandonment of harmful illusions of the state of the country. Bourgeois payment methods were needed to increase the productivity of labor. 

## CHAPTER 5: THE SOVIET THERMIDOR
### 1.Why Stalin Triumphed
It’s obvious that the bureaucracy has zigzagged from one policy to another. This is because they have no foresight, and are caught napping by the effects of their actions time after time.

“A political struggle is in its essence a struggle of interests and forces, not of arguments.” This explains why even though the Left Opposition was more farsighted theoretically, it was still defeated in the political arena. 

While the leaders play a significant role in events, the factions at play always demand leaders that represent them, so in a final analysis it is the balance of forces that determine history, not the leaders themselves. 

Every revolution begets a reaction, or even a counterrevolution. This usually targets the leaders of the masses, who are then replaced by new leaders who are less noble by far. 
The USSR was not immune to this trend. Reaction came in waves, and the Bolshevik cadres were decimated by the civil war. Careerism flooded through the Soviets and all state positions. The demobilization of the Red Army resulted in the high-ranking leaders filling the upper positions in the state apparatus, further pushing the masses away from participation in the running of the state. 

This reaction bolstered the resolve and confidence of the bureaucracy in seizing more privileges and power for itself. This new caste began to see itself as less of a force to serve the proletariat, and more of an arbitrator between the classes in the Soviet Union.
As the bureaucracy guided revolutions around the world into the rocks, the failure of these revolutions provided more power to the bureaucracy as the workers lost hope in world revolution. 

### 2.The Degeneration of the Bolshevik Party
The structure of the Bolsheviks was that of authentic democratic centralism. The membership of the party was strictly delineated, but all who entered it had equal right to guide the party. 

This structure is nowhere to be found in the later ComIntern, where leaders were appointed from above and weren't accountable to the membership. 

Democracy was curtailed as a result of challenges in the civil war. Opposition parties were banned in order to preserve the country as a whole. 

Stalin rose to power not through willpower but because his outlook was the same as the emerging petit bourgeois layer of administrators. He believed that the cause of socialism was a national and administrative problem to be solved. 

After Lenin’s death, the Central Committee opened the floodgates to new untrained members, drowning out any opposition among the remaining Marxist cadres. 
Stalin then eliminated his rivals from the Central Committee. From the Politburo of Lenin’s time now only Stalin remains.

The word sovbour - soviet bourgeois - appeared in the worker’s vocabulary early on. 
In a proletarian state, a social (not class) division of the proletariat can occur, and did occur in the Soviet Union. “The social situation of the communist who has at his disposition an automobile, a good apartment, regular vacations, and receives the party maximum of salary, differs from the situation of the communist who works in the coal mines, where he receives from 50 to 60 rubles a month.”

Having the same lifestyle and social conditions, it’s no wonder that the new ruling straum began to adopt the morality of the bourgeoisie and former ruling class. Even linguistically, the bosses have begun to refer to their inferiors with informal tone, while workers use the formal form of Russian when talking to their bosses again.

### 3.The Social Roots of Thermidor
It is impossible for a new ruling stratum to rise on its own willpower. It must have deep social causes. 

Lenin hypothesized that the state’s functions would begin to decrease in scope immediately after the revolution, as it no longer needed to protect private property. As the functions of the state became more and more universal among the population, there would be less and less need for a centralized machine of repression. The opposite trend has emerged in the USSR. This shows that we either need to radically revise the Marxist theory of the state, or admit that the USSR is not on the right track. 

The lie of the bureaucrats on the topic of internal debate is revealed when one asks, “Why was open and heated debate possible during the revolution, when the ruling class still had armies at its disposal, when it is too dangerous to debate now, when the USSR is in a much more secure position?”

The bureaucrats say that socialism has won in Russia, but also that socialism is in a precarious position, meaning that an iron-fisted dictatorship is needed.

“The basis of bureaucratic rule is the poverty of society in objects of consumption, with the resulting struggle of each against all. When there is enough goods in a store, the purchasers can come whenever they want to. When there is little goods, the purchasers are compelled to stand in line. When the lines are very long, it is necessary to appoint a policeman to keep order. Such is the starting point of the power of the Soviet bureaucracy. It “knows” who is to get something and who has to wait.”

The increase in the productive forces, instead of weakening the bureaucracy, has strengthened it instead. This is because the bureaucrats have defended their own privileges and expanded the bourgeois features of the workers’ state.

## CHAPTER 7: FAMILY, YOUTH, AND CULTURE
### 1.Thermidor in the Family
The october revolution made an honest attempt to make men and women equal by giving women equal rights and inclusion in economic and cultural work. However, women have the burden of childbirth and rearing, which cannot be divided equally between the sexes. 

There was an attempt made to absorb all the functions of the family unit into social structures such as child care centers and kindergartens. 

However, we cannot ignore that most Soviet families were unchanged by the 30s. The state simply didn't have the resources to carry these plans out to their full extent. “You cannot abolish the family, you have to replace it.”

The new structures such as communal dining and laundries proved to be unreliable and generally worse than the previous home arrangements. Therefore, whenever possible, workers preferred the old ways. 

Because there wasn’t the infrastructure to provide safe abortions, the bureaucracy reversed course and made abortion illegal, saying that because Soviet society was so successful, there was no need to ever abort children. 

The bureaucracy supports the reformation of the family beyond what necessity demands. They prefer a hierarchical structure to discipline children to accept the iron rule of the bureaucrats over them. Truly socialistic relations in child-raising would put dangerous ideas in the heads of the youth. 

### 2. The Struggle Against the Youth
The youth are always the chief supporters of revolutionary movements. The failure of old ideas to continue growing expresses itself as a failure to attract young supporters. 
The revolution exposed the fragility and ever-changing nature of the world and society to the youth. 

Engels and Lenin conceived of a socialist future in which the first generation after the revolution would begin the work of erasing the state, and the second generation would complete it. That is far from what happened in the USSR. 

Being adventurous and seeking a real future, the youth have their fingers burned when they try and enter politics. They have only three real choices - join the bureaucracy and make a career, join the Opposition and begin to really struggle, or ignore politics altogether. Most choose the third option. 

The youth is prepared for a clash with the bureaucracy. Because of this, the latter have restricted the political roles of youth organizations such as the Communist Youth. 

### 3. Nationality and Culture
The genuine development of the Soviet Union’s nationalities required total political and cultural autonomy, but a strong degree of economic centralization and coordination. The contradiction between these needs would be easily overcome if the affairs of the nations were controlled by the people themselves, but instead they are controlled by the bureaucracy. 

The bureaucracy was still carrying out some progressive work in advancing the more backward and undeveloped nationalities, with the introduction of education and written language to some nomadic peoples, for instance. The clan structures of primitive society were being replaced by the more standardized Soviet society. However, this has nothing to do with socialism. It’s just that even bourgeois methods and customs are playing a progressive role here. 

In the same way that rural peasants try to imitate the customs of visiting city dwellers, seeking their higher cultural level, so too do Soviet emissaries to Europe seek to bring Europe’s higher level of culture back to the USSR. This demonstrates that the USSR lags behind the capitalist West. 

It would be inaccurate to say that the Russian ethnicity dominates the others. Instead, it is the bureaucracy that dominates all ethnicities in the Soviet Union, homogenizing them and curbing whatever tendencies prove to be untenable for the bureaucratic regime. 

The sphere of the sciences is being heavily curtailed by the zig zags of the regime. Scientists are compelled to research only that which is guaranteed to provide short-term results, even though the most useful discoveries are often accidental. 

Even the development of Marxism has stalled, as all the Marxists with something new or useful to say are in prison or dead. 

Art is useful as an indicator of social relations, as culture always flows from the economic base. The art in the USSR is totally dead, reeking of political games and bullshit. The suggestions and personal tastes of those in power become whole artistic trends and movements, as artists furiously try to keep up with the ever-changing needs and wants of the bureaucracy. Art is not allowed to develop organically, as there isn’t the economic basis or surplus resources that make artistic growth possible. Therefore, artists have to rely on the patronage of the bureaucracy.

## CHAPTER 9: SOCIAL RELATIONS IN THE SOCIAL UNION
### Not Yet Decided by History
 In 1934, 28% of the population were employed by state enterprises. 46% worked on collective farms and co-operative businesses. The remaining 23% were individual peasants and craftsmen, but these 23% had only 4% of national [[capital]]. This demonstrates that the planned economy was very strong in the USSR, and was always getting stronger throughout this period. 
 
We need to be careful in our analysis of this fact. Although the “socialist” sector was gaining on the private sector, we need to see the social reality behind the arithmetic. The increase in material level had begun to awaken higher demands in the population, but was too low to satisfy them for all. This caused a development of petty bourgeois appetites among all layers of the population. This is one reason for the incredibly low levels of productivity in the socialist sector. 

The new constitution defined state property as the property of all the people as a whole. This is not necessarily true. “In order to become social, private property must as inevitably pass through the state stage as the caterpillar in order to become a butterfly must pass through the pupal stage. But the pupa is not a butterfly.” State property only becomes social property to the degree to which social differentiation dies away. And it had not died away in the USSR. In fact, in some ways social classes were widening in difference. The urban-rural gap was widening, as was the gap between physical and intellectual labor (the bureaucrats lumping in their wealth with the intellectuals). 

These divides are masked when we examine property in the realm of production. However, the difference between a peoples’ commissar who has a new apartment, a new car, and fancy clothes; and a worker who doesn't even have a pair of shoes is a crucial difference. 

### State Capitalism?
The idea of the collective bourgeoisie using their state to directly manage the whole of the economy is theoretically possible, but has never arisen due to the contradictions between individual capitalists, and the fact that such a state would be an incredibly tempting target for revolution. 

During WW2, especially in the fascist world, “state-ism” was a phenomenon. The state increased its regulatory oversight to a large degree, and there is overlap between the concepts of state-ism and state capitalism. However, these systems are in fact opposites. State capitalism is the swapping out of private property for state property. 
State-ism was, in fact, an attempt at preserving private property through state interference. State-ism is completely reactionary in character. It supports dying businesses, old techniques, and parasitic social strata against the forces of progress. 
The fascist state, far from being the owner of [[capital]] itself, is an intermediary between the owners of [[capital]]. For a fascist state to become state capitalist, it would have to expropriate the capitalists, a move that would place it on the other side of the barricades, so to speak. 

### Is the Bureaucracy a Ruling Class?
The nationalization of the land, means of production, and infrastructure; along with the monopoly of foreign trade characterize the Soviet economic system. This was carried out through a general expropriation of the capitalist class by a proletarian movement. Therefore, the characterization of the USSR as a proletarian state is surely true. 

The Soviet bureaucracy is like every other bureaucracy, except for the degree of independence it has achieved from its supporting class. In bourgeois society, the bureaucracy represents the interests of a well educated class, which has the ability to strictly regulate the activities of the bureaucrats. Contrast that to the USSR, where the bureaucracy has risen above a class which is hardly literate and possesses nothing but its own labor power. The Soviet bureaucracy is more free than any other to pursue its own interests, and is therefore something beyond a normal bureaucracy. 

If the bureaucracy was to continue its solidification of these social relations through gaining a more secure grasp on state control, it would end up totally liquidating the gains of the proletarian revolution (spoiler alert: this is what happened.) 

The final nail in the coffin of this solidification would be the creation of special types of property that the bureaucrats could be eligible for. This never really happened, I wonder if this is what the bureaucrats were trying to do during glasnost. 

However, the bureaucracy is not really a class. Bureaucrats don’t actually own the means of production, nor do they really own anything at all. There is no transmittance of wealth to one’s children. 

Eventually, socialism will triumph over capitalism due to pure mathematics. Just as feudalism died away regardless of its political battles to preserve itself, so will capitalism once the material level reaches a high enough standard. However, the USSR wasn’t there yet. Therefore, it had to maintain its progress towards socialism through political will. That means that if the bureaucracy fell, the planned economy would fall along with it, and capitalism would be restored. 

The Soviet bureaucracy of the 30s preserved socialist tradition and state property only to the extent that it feared the proletariat going to the side of the oppositional Bolshevik-Leninists (later known as the Left Opposition). 

The bureaucracy had so far betrayed the revolution, but had not yet overthrown it. 

### The Question of the Character of the Soviet Union
There are two possible routes forward for the USSR. If the bureaucracy was overthrown by a renewed Bolshevik party, which purged all state institutions of the old rot, abolishing rank and privilege, and restoring Soviet democracy, but it would not have to resort to revolutionary measures. All property worth seizing is already in the hands of the state, so seizure of state power is all that would be needed.

On the other hand, what would happen if a bourgeois party were to overthrow the ruling caste? It would find many allies among the current bureaucracy. The restoration of private property would require a whole social revolution in production. 

What would happen if the bureaucracy just continued on its current path? Eventually, the bureaucracy will feel comfortable enough to start seeking to solidify its property relation as owner of [[capital]]. This will intensify the contradictions in Soviet society, until a breaking point is reached. In the ensuing struggle, either the bureaucracy will win and become a new capitalist class, or the proletariat will restore a healthy workers’ state. 
The Soviet state existed in an intermediate stage between socialism and capitalism. During this stage, movement towards either outcome was possible. 

## CHAPTER 10: THE SOVIET UNION IN THE MIRROR OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION
### Work “According to Ability” and Personal Property
The new constitution was hailed by Stalin as the most democratic ever created. The process by which it was created was not democratic at all. 

The constitution says that Soviet society lives by the creed, “from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.” This is not the case. Soviet society doesn’t have the high level of productivity to guarantee this slogan. 

Due to its continued reliance of piecework payment, society more closely follows “from each as much as possible, to each as little as possible.”

The constitution guarantees personal property, which is all well and good - but it does so mainly to protect the ever-increasing wealth of the bureaucracy. 

### The Soviets and Democracy
The most important change due to the new constitution is the return to bourgeois forms of democracy. This is in effect a liquidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Gone is the power of the factory committees. 

The excuse for this is that there are supposedly no longer any classes in Soviet society, and therefore a bourgeois democracy is ok. This is bullshit. While there are no longer capitalists per se, there are still distinctions between peasant, worker, skilled worker, and bureaucrat that are important. 

The state calls itself Soviet, but this is a ruse. The raw democratic potential of class rule through the soviets are nowhere to be found in the new government. 

If classes have truly died away in the USSR, the bureaucracy and the state itself should also be well on their way to dying away. Wouldn’t the state persist until the global bourgeoisie died away?

#### Democracy and the Party
While the structures are democratic, the people can only choose between candidates that the party selects. 

The Bolsheviks also wielded a monopoly on political power during the Civil War, but this was under very grim circumstances. There was also a red hot debate within the Bolsheviks at this time, and that helped to prevent outright corruption that we see later on in the Communist Party. 

Stalin says that political parties are not needed because since there are no classes, there will be no differences in political opinion throughout society. Not true. Marxism teaches us that political [[class consciousness]] is dynamic and always shifting, and there are progressive and regressive layers in each class. In fact, there is not a single example of a political party relying on one single class. 

Also, if there are no classes, as Stalin says, there should be no political parties, right? But the Communist Party isn’t going away any time soon. 

[[Bukharin]] approaches this from another angle. He says that since the victory of socialism is assured in the USSR, they cannot permit counter-revolutionaries to openly organize. But there is a flaw in this logic. If socialism is winning, and the working class has been firmly won to the side of progress, then how could there be enough counter-revolutionaries for their organizations to be powerful? Even the forces of counter revolution must rely on the working class or the petty bourgeois or somebody. 

The constitution says that any social organization can put forward candidates for office, but the constitution also reveals that the Communist Party is the “...guiding nucleus of all organizations, both social and governmental.” 

Perhaps internal factions within the party could be expressed anyway. This would be the case if not for the brutal waves of purges that sweep the party regularly. 

The bureaucracy as a whole is interested in allowing some of the most excessive examples of corruption and privilege to be removed in the interest of self-preservation. This is the reason for the secret ballot, and for elections to be held at all, really. 

What does Trotsky mean by saying the political significance of the soviets was lost long ago? He means that the soviets have already been thoroughly bought out and overcome by bureaucratism. 

## CHAPTER 11: WHITHER THE SOVIET UNION?
### Bonapartism as a Regime of Crisis
How can we explain the contradiction between the many mistakes of the bureaucracy and its material success? We can see that from the viewpoint of maintaining centralized power in the hands of the bureaucracy, these mistakes are not really mistakes. 

The support of the kulaks until 1928 seems like a mistake from the perspective of building socialism, but this petty bourgeois influence helped the bureaucracy counterbalance the authentic remnants of the vanguard. When this was no longer needed, the bureaucracy destroyed the kulaks. 

As soon as the kulaks were liquidated, the bureaucracy turned to the task of building a new aristocracy. Again, this ‘mistake’ was totally intentional, because it helped solidify the privileges of the bureaucrats. 

There are historical factors more powerful than the bureaucracy. The regime is forced to try and stabilize the economy, and this means an accurate accounting of resources. This accuracy is impossible due to the corruption in the bureaucracy, so that’s one contradiction the bureaucracy can’t get around. 

The workers are complaining more and more loudly about issues in the management of production. 

The math and figures of money show the lies of the bureaucracy even when they can be covered up in words. The numbers don’t lie. 

Bonapartism appears when the struggle between classes becomes so sharp that a totally unhindered state apparatus is needed to defend the ruling class. This state often seems to be independent of the ruling class because it often reins in the more excessive members of the ruling class to ensure the survival of the class as a whole. 

While [[Stalinism]] and Fascism have totally different social roots, they are symmetrical. Both have arisen because of the lateness of the proletarian revolution, and are last-ditch efforts to save class society. 

### The Struggle of the Bureaucracy with “the Class Enemy”
During the first ten years of the Left Opposition, the slogan was “reform, not revolution.” The LO wanted to conquer power within the CP. However, the bureaucracy was ready for any level of struggle to defend itself. 

The bureaucracy’s strategy is generally to use judicial forgery to accuse a LO member with some crime. Under threat of death, they are made to “confess” to this crime, and to name more firm LO members as collaborators. These false accusations are used to bolster the effort to frame more popular or powerful LO members, and so the cycle continues. 

In one breath, the bureaucracy allows the entry of former bourgeois into the party while it says that the most fervent supporters of the Bolsheviks during the revolution can no longer be trusted. 

### The Inevitability of a New Revolution
Since the new system of the USSR provokes indignation and spite at every layer of the working class, a conflict is inevitable. The improvement of the material conditions only allows more freedom of thought for the worker, and more self-respect. This hastens the conflict. 

The question comes down to which group will devour the other. Either the workers will cast off the layer of scum that has accumulated, or the bureaucracy will suffocate the workers movement and return to capitalism eventually. The workers have only hesitated to struggle openly because they fear capitalist restoration. 

While the regime seems to be stabilizing, the driving of contradictions underground only intensifies them in the long run. 

The occasional acts of individual terror against the bureaucracy only strengthen it. Any individual can be easily replaced, and the murder of one can be used to further purge internal enemies of the bureaucracy. 

In the USSR, only a political revolution was needed at this point. The social basis of Soviet society was still soundly planned, and soundly controlled by the state. Such a revolution would restore soviet democracy, and true involvement of the masses in the operations of society. 

The most important change would be a return of foreign policy to one of radical internationalism. In 1937, the question of the world revolution was being decided in Spain, France, China, and many other places. The Soviet Union was in a position to aid these revolutions but the bureaucracy was holding it back. 

## Appendix: “Socialism in One Country”
What the bureaucracy really meant when they spoke of the victory of socialism in one country was really their victory in the USSR. 

The law of uneven development was “discovered” by Marx and Engels. It was well understood that a likely outcome of the workers movement would be a single isolated workers state. 

The theory of Socialism in One Country had a real purpose of claiming that the revolution in the USSR was completed, and no further action needed to be taken. This goes against basic ideas established by Marx and Lenin, and is incorrect. 

The LO said that the USSR must catch up with the rate of development of the rest of the world. Stalin shot down this idea, but then later adopted it out of necessity. 

### The “Friends” of the Soviet Union
The role of the “sympathetic” western press is important, as is the role of the Communist International. However, sympathy with the bureaucracy is not the same as sympathy with the Soviet proletariat. 

Lenin had no patience for the bourgeois commenters who viewed themselves as socialists. These are the same kinds of people who now speak favorably about the USSR but fail to answer the question of whether or not revolution must come to the rest of the world, and in what form it ought to come. 

Petty bourgeois “friends of the Soviet Union” are really just putting on this act to absolve themselves of capitalist guilt. They often travel to the USSR and see parades, closing their eyes to the new Soviet aristocracy. They defend the USSR uncritically, and say that they do this because of unfair attacks in the West. The capitalist press is indeed lying about the USSR, but that’s no excuse to also lie in support of it. The working class is in desperate need of level headed allies. 

Some say that the criticism of the LO will enable a capitalist takeover. This is nonsense. Will the bourgeois be so inspired by our denunciation that they mount an invasion to restore the authentic principles of socialism? The bourgeois already know of the USSR’s degeneration, or else they would be hell bent on exterminating the germ of the revolution.
