 Martin begins by giving an overview of the COVID tolls on Latin America, highlighting the discrepancies between official numbers and reality. He ties this to the economic situation of a five-year stagnation, followed by a 7% [[GDP]] contraction. He says this is unprecedented in the history of an post-colonial Latin America. 
 
 Martin notes that the crisis will likely worsen due to the failure of governments to control COVID. However, he argues that the economic crisis was caused by [[capitalism]] itself, and [[COVID-19]] merely accelerated and made the crisis worse. 
 
 Martin points out the political climate of Latin America, saying that 2019, especially October 2019, saw enormous uphevals across the region. He calls attention to uprisings in [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]. In Ecuador, Martin says that the government was forced to flee the capital. 
 
 Martin contrasts the declining standards for workers with the increase in the number of billionaires, saying that this is causing social friction across the region. 
 
 The author tells us that while COVID-19 has provided the appearance of a paralyzed revolutionary process, under the surface the process is continuing under the surface. He says that the masses really have no alternative but to continue fighting. He highlights the upringings in [[Colombia]] where many police stations were burned, and the mobilizations in [[Peru]] around the removal of the corrupt President. 
 
 Martin also describes the events in [[Guatemala]] where protestors set fire to the parliament in 2020, and the uprising in [[Paraguay]] where the masses took to the streets to protest the lack of medical supplies. 
 
 Based on these events, Martin argues that the revolutionary movement is back in motion in Latin America. 
 
 ## Huge polarization and discrediting of the institutions of bourgeois democracy
 The author asserts that there is a wave of mistrust towards all the institutions of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] rule. He says this is reflected in the slogans of the movements and in the results of the constituent elections in Chile. 
 
 He says that those elections delivered defeat for the right wing, and also for the [[reformism|reformist]] left parties that the masses now see as traitors. 
 
 ## The slogan of the Constituent Assembly
 Martin argues that the constituent assembly was a tool used by the Chilean bourgeoisie to divert energy from the 2019 uprising back into legal channels. He says that the only party not in agreement over the need for a constituent assembly was the Communist Party, however they did not strongly oppose the motion. 
 
 The author believes that in general, constituent assemblies are only different from normal bourgeois parliaments in that they seek to create new constitutions in order to restore faith in the bourgeois [[state]]. 
 
 Martin asserts that from the point of view of the masses, the assembly seems like a good plan to change society for the better. He says that therefore, the task of the [[Marxism|Marxists]] is to explain the danger of a constituent assembly. He elaborates that this danger lies in the diversion of revolutionary energy into channels that are safer for the bourgeoisie. However, Martin reminds us that it is also our goal to connect with the healthy instinct of the masses in their effort to fundamentally change society.
 
 Martin explains that in Chile, the [[IMT]] rejected slogans calling for a constituent assembly, preferring other slogans. Instead, he says that the IMT adopted the demand of holding a national assembly of workers - raising the question of dual power. According to him, if the Chilean constituent assembly happens, then the IMT would have the same approach to it as to any other bourgeois election - that is, to participate as a means of explaining the need for a revolutionary program. 
 
 ## Is the problem neoliberalism?
 Martin turns to Peru to discuss their elections in June 2021. He says that one one side we find Pedro Castillo, from *Peru Libre,* a self defined Marxist, Leninist party. On the other hand, he continues, we find Fujimori, a right-wing demagogue and daughter of the former dictator. 
 
 The author elaborates that Castillo rose to prominence due to his role in the 2017 teachers' strike, which was targeted against the bureaucracy in the [[unions]], controlled by the Peruvian Communist Party. 
 
 Although he praises the victory of Castillo as reflective of a rapidly maturing situation, Martin criticizes *Peru Libre* for some defects in their program. He argues that by framing the issue as that of "neoliberalism," *Peru Libre* allows capitalism to escape blame for the crisis. Martin further asserts that the program of *Peru Libre* betrays [[class independence]] by calling on the "national, productive business community" to ally with the Peruvian people against neoliberalism. 
 
 Martin casts scorn on this idea, and compares it to the ideas of [[Stalinism]] on the two-stage theory of revolution. He cites [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] and [[The Permanent Revolution (1931)]] as explaining why this theory is absurd and counter-revolutionary. 
 
 ## Balance of "progressive governments"
 The author compares *Peru Libre* with the government of Morales in [[Bolivia]]. He says this, along with other "progressive" governments in the region, benefited from high raw material prices, a pattern that existed between 2003 and 2014. 
 
 Martin says that this economic advantage gave leaders more wiggle room to institute reforms under capitalism. However, the author explains that this trend was due to the expansion of the economy of [[China]], and that pattern has come to an end. 
 
 The author casts blame on these parties of [[reformism]], saying that they functionally restored the legitimacy of the bourgeois system after periods of revolutionary convulsions.
 
 Now, Martin says, the perspective is one of a tightening noose around these parties, as the room to manuver within capitalism shrinks. He says that in most cases, these reformists will fail to break with capitalism, and will instead implement a policy counter to the interests of their social base. 
 
 Martin points out that this is a necessary experience for the masses in the region. He develops the point that we must remain commited to [[permanent revolution]] and explain that a two-stage process is totally unscientific and impossible. 
 
 ## The prolonged national strike in Colombia
 Turning to the situation in Colombia, Martin says that we've seen enormous resistance in the face of state violence. He points to the criminalization of protest, the killings and disappearances, as well as the portrayal of demonstrators as Venezuelan agents or narco-terrorists. 
 
 However, the author notes that none of these efforts have broken the spirit of the protestors, and they remain popular. He says that it's impressive that the government of Duque was forced to withdraw their tax reform bill, and the health reform bill, both of which were demands of the movement. 
 
 Martin says that the only thing lacking in Colombia is a revolutionary leadership that is up to the task of leading the various organs of self-defense that the [[peasantry]] and [[proletariat]] have formed in some areas. 
 
 He outlines the slogans that the IMT has put forward- the formation of popular assemblies, the expansion of the occupations of public places into a true general strike, and the organization of self-defence committees across the country. 
 
 ## A continental and world process revolution
 The author explains that national pecularities aside, the processes that have happened in Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile are quite similar. He goes on to argue that similar conditions exist in most Latin American countries. 
 
 Martin notes that the *Financial Times* is alarmed at the possibility of crisis spreading across the region. 
 
 ## Youth and women at the forefront of the revolutionary movement
 Martin outlines how in all these movements, youth, and particularly young women, have played a front-line role. He explains that the youth, having nothing to lose and nowhere to go, have become the inspiration for the whole working class. 
 
 Martin says that this is an international phenomenon that has parallels with [[June 2020 uprising]] in the [[USA]], as well as the movement in [[Palestine]]. 
 
 The author proclaims that we don't study these movement for academic purposes, but to transform the world. He says we can see that the crucial question is that of revolutionary leadership, which the IMT seeks to build in all its sections around the world.
