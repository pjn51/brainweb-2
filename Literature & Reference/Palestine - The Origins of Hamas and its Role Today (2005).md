The author begins by explaining that [[Hamas]] had emerged as a force in [[Palestine]] and was hitting the headlines due to a series of suicide bombings. The author says that this article will cover the origins of Hamas, and examine how [[Israel]] has actually used Hamas to their own benefit in the past. 

The author brings our attention to the phenomenon of Islamic fundamentalism in general, which he says operates in 70 countries and how this movement has existed in opposition to genuine [[Marxism]] since the October revolution in [[Russia]]. 

The author turns to the Middle East specifically, saying that Islamic fundamentalism first emerged in [[Egypt]] in 1928. He says that for a long time, the Russian revolution had provided an alternative to fundamentalism for the masses, and even the forces of [[Stalinism]] acted as a brake on the development of fundamentalism since it was still developing the productive forces in spite of deformations.

The author explains that the rise of these Islamic movements was a shock to the [[liberalism|liberals]] and the left leaning middle class, who believed that "modernization" following the 50s and 60s would inevitable lead to more progressive societies. Instead, the author says they witnessed a growth of forces that turned development backwards, looking to history for a solution to modern issues. 

The author explains this by bringing up the crisis of Stalinism and the collapse of the USSR. He says that this led to the "total capitulation" of the national [[bourgeoisie]] in these countries. However, this doesn't totally add up since the USSR was still going pretty strong in the 1950s, and collapsed much later in 1991. 

The author says that in the 50s and 60s, the national liberation struggles led by the [[petty bourgeoisie]] against [[imperialism]] inspired a section of the "middle classes" in the ex-colonial countries who demanded nationalization of some sections of the economy as a protection against imperialism. He says that these currents were seen as a movement with real solutions, and therefore had a degree of influence over the masses.

The author turns to the late 70s and 80s, describing the changing mood of the masses in regards to the USSR. He says that as many saw the strangulation of the productive forces happening in the USSR and turned their back on that path forward. He says the mood became one of despair, and it was this despair that laid the foundation for Islamic fundamentalism.

## The real nature of Islamic fundamentalism
The author says that the modern left analysis of Islamic fundamentalism is often misguided in one of two ways. The first way, according to him, is the categorization of Islamic fundamentalism as a form of [[fascism]]. He says that this leads the left to support the national bourgeoisie or even the forces of imperialism against the fascists, such as in the case of the FLN in Algeria. He says that the left supported the FLN even as the latter implemented the monetary policies of the International Monetary Fund. 

To me, this seems incomplete, since we know that the most effective way to combat fascism is a mobilization of the working class. Therefore, the error in supporting the FLN could have come not because of a misguided belief in Islamo-fascism, but an incorrect method in fighting fascism.

On the other hand, the author says that some on the left categorize Islamic fundamentalism as progessive and anti-imperialist. He says that this position was taken by much of the left in [[Iran]] in the early phase of their revolution in 1979, elaborating that much of the Iranian cadres paid in blood for this mistake. 

Turning to an analysis of Islam generally, the author says that while Islam emerged in the 7th century as the ideology of merchant tribes, it now has a different class basis. He says that Islam only exists today because it obtained funding from the landowners and the industrialists of modern [[capitalism]]. He goes on to say that Islam enjoys its mass appeal since it provides consolation to the poor and oppressed on one hand, while protecting the exploiting classes against the direct fury of the workers. In this way, he claims that it represents a roadblock to socialist revolution.

Furthermore, he points out the way that fundamentalists lean on the economic teachings of Islam in countries that lack any sort of safety net. The author brings up the Islamic demand for a 2.5% tax on the rich, as well as the precept that rules govern in a just way and that women are respected by their husbands. He says that while this is the friendly face that the preachers present to the masses, any expropriation of the property of the rich is met with mutilation or execution, under the same Islamic law. 

To this fact, the author counterposes the sometimes-aggresive way that fundamentalism can come into contact with imperialism. He points to the occupation of the [[USA]] Embassy in Iran for instance, or the struggle of Hamas against Israel. 

He summarizes that the Islamic movement is neother fascist, nor anti-imperialist in a final analysis. He says that they don't fight capitalism, they fight against the cultural expressions of capitalism. To him, this means that fundamentalism represents a populist movement, not a revolutionary one. He calls it a "petty bourgeois movement dressed up in [[religion|religious]] clothes."

Bringing in a general analysis of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, the author says that the petty bourgeoisie can't really follow its own path, but is swept along with other class forces. Therefore, he concludes that the real question is the balance of forces between the workers and the capitalists, including the subjective factor of the leadership of both classes. 

Turning to the events of 2005, he says that the rising tide of working class militancy in the region provided an opportunity to the left to become the leadership of the working class. He takes the case of [[Iraq]], where he says that the Communist Party of Iraq should have taken the lead in the struggle against the [[USA|American]] occupation, but instead decided to join the US-backed governing council. He says that this move ensured that the struggle would remain under the control of the fundamentalists. 

He ends the section by calling for a revolutionary opposition within the Communist Party of Iraq that could pose a clear alternative to the current rightwing leadership.

## The Muslim Brotherhood
The author turns once again to Egypt, where he says the Muslim Brotherhood was born and grew rapidly in the 30s and 40s. He says it grew because it gained from those disillusioned by the Stalinists and the compromises that the bourgeoise nationalist Wafd had made with the [[UK]]. 

The author says that the Brotherhood could portray itself as anti-imperialist by recruting fighters to struggle against British occupation and to fight against newly-created Israel (which was backed by [[Stalin]]). 

Just as the Brotherhood became a mass movement, the author says that it began to disintegrate due to its internal contradictions. As a populist movement, the author points to the different directions that the rank-and-file and the leadership were pulling. He says that the base was more connected with the petty bourgeoisie and the masses, while the leadership was connected to the capitalist class and the state, and ultimately, imperialism. 

The author says that the seizure of power by General Nagrib and Nasser in 1952 provided a fundamental divide between supporters and opponents of the coup within the Brotherhood. He says that this disunity allowed Nasser to crush the organization relatively easily. 

The author says that the imperalists shifted their propaganda from anti-Communist to anti-Islamic. He says this often had a reflection in the petty bourgeois left in the Middle East, who viewed the fundamentalists as the ultimate threat to progress. He says this led them to side with the "liberal" wing of the bourgeoisie or even to support military dictatorships. 

He turns now to the Iranian revolution, saying that it was not driven by Islamic fundamentalism, but was driven instead by the contradicitons within the Shah's regime in the 1970s. Due to a conflict between the national bourgeoisie and the imperialists, heightened by rapid urbanization, left wing guerellas and the left-Islamic forces were able to fracture the unity of the military, crashing the regime. The author claims that the real tragedy of the revolution was that the left supported Ayatollah Khomeini, praising him as a progressive leader. The author concludes that this lack of revolutionary working class leadership allowed the Islamic clergy to consoldiate support and come to power. 

The author says that this failure led to the creation of a totalitarian regime in Iran that was similar to the Stalinist regimes, but Iran remained capitalist. 

## Israel's support for Hamas in the past
The author says that while Marxists must support the cause of Palestinian liberation no matter who leads the struggle in the moment, we must accept that Hamas is not a revolutionary organization. He says that Hamas favors the construction of an Islamic state, not the end of class society. 

The author compares the rise of Hamas to that of the Taliban in [[Afghanistan]], saying that Israel created this monster and then lost control. The author cites a UPI Correspondent, Richard Sale, who says that Israel gave direct and indirect aid to Hamas throughout the 1970s. 

The author claims that Israel supported Hamas to divide the movement led by the [[PLO]] (the Palestinian Liberation Organization) and provide a religious alternative to the PLO's secular vision. 

Covering the initial rise of Hamas, the author points to the aftermath of the Six Day War in 1967. He says that Hamas worked extensively among the refugees in the Gaza Strip, creating a [[mutual aid]] network known as Da'wah. He says that this social influence grew into political influence. 

According to one US official who spoke anonymously, Israel favored Hamas being in power because Israel knew that Hamas would never enter peace negotiations, justifying continued military force by Israel over the entire region. To them, this would mean that Israel would continue to be the only democracy in the region for the US to rely upon. 

## Hamas today
The author says that in 2000, less than 18% of the Palestinian population supported the political views of Hamas. But after the uprising in 2000, and the failure of the PLO to provide any leadership, he says that Hamas' support grew to 25%. 

The author says that mosques and Islamic organizations are Hamas' main vehicle for propaganda and agitation. He goes on to outline the relationship between the PLO and Hamas, saying that Hamas boycotted the 1996 elections to avoid giving legitimacy to the recognition of Israel by Arafat. 

As for Arafat, the author says that he was able to restrain the terrorst attacks by Hamas in some cases, but wasn't powerful enough to supress them altogether. The author elaborates that the rising unemployment among Palestinians under the PLO's leadership spread the influence of Hamas. 

During the Al-Kuds Intifada, the author says that Hamas carried out terrorist campaign that killed many Israeli civilians, strengthening the influence of the right-wing there. The author points out that whenever the Prime Minister of Israel needs to divert the masses away from class struggle, he orders the assassination of Hamas leaders, and waits for Hamas to counter-attack and play its role as agents of nationalist and ethnic struggle as opposed to class struggle. 

The author concludes that the only way out of this bloody cycle is to develop a revolutionary leadership capable of undercutting the power of both Hamas and the Israeli state. He says that this leadership could lead the masses in a socialist revolution in the whole of the Middle East.
