# One
Marx's issue with the [[materialism]] of Feuerbach is that he concieved of the object *or* of contemplation. He thought of these two things as totally separate, without considering their interaction, the real process of comprehending an object. Fundamentally, Feuerbach had a perspective of [[metaphysics]]. 

Marx claims that Feuerbach failed to apply materialism to the *active side* of this process, and fell into [[idealism]] there.

Marx supports the idea that [[Thought and activity are inseperable]]. 

# Two
Thinking, isolated from practice, is totally academic. When we talk about the question of gaining knowledge from thinking, Marx explains that we cannot ignore the practical part of thinking, the application of ideas to the real world. Only through the testing of ideas in the real world can we gain true knowledge from thinking about things. 

# Three
Marx asserts that "the materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances" fails to apply [[dialectics]] to the relationship between the person who changes the circumstances, and the circumstances that change the person in turn. He says that this process can only be undestood as revolutionary practice.

# Four
Marx says that Feuerbach's work consists of "resolving the [[religion|religious]] world into its secular basis" in order to overcome the fact of "religious self-[[alienation]]", the duplication of the world into a religious and secular ones. I understand the idea of a duplication of the world in bourgeois and feudal ideology, but I'm not sure what is meant by "resolving" this split into a secular basis. 

Marx emphasizes that this split must have occured due to contradictions within the secular basis, and says that we must therefore seek to understand the secular world in its contradictions, and "revolutionize it in practice." Does he mean that we must change the secular world in order to change the religious one?

# Five
This thesis is short enough to put here in full:

> Feuerbach, not satisfied with abstract thinking, wants contemplation; but he does not concieve sensuousness as practical, human-sensuous activity.

Feuerbach seems to be concerned with thinking in connection to the world, with contemplation. However, Marx criticizes his lack of investigation of the practical side of the process of contemplation. 

# Six
Marx credits Feuerbach with connecting the religious world with its roots in the humans of this secular one. However, he posits that Feuerbach fails to understand that the "secular essence" which forms the basis of the religious world is not an abstraction that exists outside of time and space, but is molded by the "enseble of the social relations."

Marx believes that this failure of analysis compells Feuerbach to engage in historical abstraction, and to place this essence outside of the historical processes, creating an abstract, fixed human for this essence to reside inside of. This compells Feuerbach to consider this essence as static, and common to all humans. 

# Seven
Marx extends this critique from the previous thesis, saying that Feuerbach fails to see that the religious sentiment he ascribes to this theoretical human is itself a product of definite circumstances, and is not a universal phenomenon common to all people in the same way. 

# Eight
Marx claims that "all social life is essentially practical." He also puts forward the idea that the mysteries which philosophy are unable to understand, and cause philosophy to turn towards mysticism, can be explained by investigating the social forces that exist around these mysteries. 

> [!question]
> Q: What is an example of one of these mysteries?

# Nine
> The highest point reached by contemplative materialism... is contemplation of single individuals and of civil society.

> [!note]
> By this, I think Marx means that materialism which fails to investigate the unique social forces that differentiate humans from one another cannot understand society *as a dynamic organism,* and can only investigate the hypothetical person and society that they suppose is universal and static.

# Ten
> The standpoint of the old materialism is civil society; the standpoint of the new is human society, or social humanity.

> [!note]
> The distinction between civil society and human society is that civil society is the static, unchanging structures that surround humans, while social humanity is the human race that moves between forms over time. Marx is counterposing the materialism of Feuerbach, which could analyze one static version of humanity, with his new materialism, which can analyze humanity in its dynamism.

# Eleven
A classic quote that demands printing in full:

> The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.

> [!note]
> Epic mic drop moment. Marxism sets out not to merely understand the world, but to understand the world in order to change it.
