## Chart recommendations
We can easily insert various kinds of charts based on the data that we have. If we don't know what kind of chart to use, we can use the "recommended charts" feature. 

If we want to fine-tune charts, we can do so by clicking the chart and adding elements (using the plus), changing chart style and color (using the brush), or adding a filter.

## New functions
Excel functions are categorized by their functionality. Inside the formulas tab, there are various groups of functions. There are lots of functions that we can use for various purposes. There are datetime functions, engineering functions, financial functions, information functions (that return the sheet number or number of sheets in a reference), logic statement functions, lookup functions, math and trig functions, statistical functions, and text functions. 

We can also create user-defined functions. There are even web functions, such as `ENCODEURL`, where we can return a url encoded string.
