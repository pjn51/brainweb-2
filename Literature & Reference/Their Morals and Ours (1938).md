> [!Abstract]
> In this short pamphlet, [[Trotsky]] analyzes [[ethics]] from a perspective of [[dialectical materialism]] and the workers' movement. A central idea is that [[Morality is historically contingent]], and contingent upon class perspective as well. 

# Moral effluvia
Trotsky says that "a moralizing philistine's" favorite strategy to criticize revolutionaries is to lump them in with reactionaries, and notes that this has been done with Tsarism and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]], as well as [[Trotskyism]] and [[Stalinism]].  (Kindle, loc 16). 

He criticizes this approach, saying that the historical process of class struggle is the real driver, not the methods used by this or that class. He notes that armies in a battle are more or less symmetrical but represent opposing forces (loc 25). 

# Marxist amoralism and eternal truths
Trotsky turns to those who counterpose the 'amoral' behavior of the revolutioaries with supposed eternal criteria that exist outside the historical process. However, he continues, where can we find such critieria? He follows this logical argument to its conclusion, that only God can provide such critieria that have existed since before the human race (loc 42). 

# "The end justifies the means"
Trotsky analyzes the morality of the Jesuits, and then turning back to the workers' movement, says that Social Democrats and centrists appear as quack doctors besides the Bolshevik as physician - he says that the former are unwilling to think things through to the end and seek to replace determination and struggle with a miracle. The Bolsheviks are warriors, he thunders, while the others are meek shopkeepers of socialism (loc 78). 

# Jesuitism and utilitarianism
Turning back to the question of ends justifying means, Trotksy explains that that poses another question: what justifies the end? Introducing a [[dialectics|dialectic]], he says that in life the ends and means continually trade places - democracy was the "end" of the class struggle (the aim), and then became the means of the class struggle (loc 105). 

In the author's view, the ruling class of every epoch forces *its* ends onto society, and uses official morality to defend and justify these ends, classifying all means which contradict these ends as immoral (loc 114). 

# "Moral precepts obligatory upon all"
Trotsky proclaims that anyone who wants to move beyond religion and superstition must accelt that morality is a product of historical development, and that it serves social interests. In a society with contradictory interests, he continues, morality must be contradictory based on the class character of that morality (loc 114). 

He gives an example, that of war - in normal times, he says, a murderer is punished, but in wartime, murder is rewarded and is even obligatory (loc 132). 

Criticizing the [[Kant proposed the categorical imperative|categorical imperative of Kant]], Trotsky says that it's merely a "shell without content" because any norm obligatory upon all ignores class - and to Trotsky, class surpasses humanity in terms of solidarity. He says that "the solidarity of workers... is incomparably more "categoric" than human solidarity in general" (loc 139).

Summarizing his view so far, the author says that the bourgeoisie is much more conscious of its class than the proletariat, and feels deeply the need to impress its own morality upon the rest of society in order to survive. The appeal to abstract norms, he says, is a deliberate attempt at deception by a class who knows its subjects have nothing in common with them (loc 139). 

# The crisis in democratic morality
Trotsky investigates the relationship between the context of the [[Germany|German]] social democratic movement, and the morality of its leaders. He says that as the movement grew during a time of plenty, the outward relations between the classes softened, and an ethic of collaboration had space to develop. He explains that this influenced the "common sense" of the period (loc 150). 

# "Common sense"
Trotsky argues that under certain limitations, common sense (the amalgomation of experiences one has directly had, or been told, that define our perception of how things work) can be an adequate way to get around the world. However, he specifies, when this common sense goes beyond its limits and attempts to grasp more complex things, it utterly fails and transforms into total stupidity (loc 172). [[Common sense has limitations]]. 

Explaining the reason for this, Trotsky says that common sense operates only on unchanging magnitudes, while in reality, [[Change is omnipresent]]. On the other hand, he continues, dialectics is able to analyze phenomena in their *development* rather than their stable existance. He exclaims that there is nothing more "flat, stale, self-satisfied, and cynical" than the unchanging rules and regulations of common sense (loc 194).
