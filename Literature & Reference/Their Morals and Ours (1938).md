> [!Abstract]
> In this short pamphlet, [[Trotsky]] analyzes [[ethics]] from a perspective of [[dialectical materialism]] and the workers' movement. A central idea is that [[Morality is historically contingent]], and contingent upon class perspective as well. 

# Moral effluvia
Trotsky says that "a moralizing philistine's" favorite strategy to criticize revolutionaries is to lump them in with reactionaries, and notes that this has been done with Tsarism and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]], as well as [[Trotskyism]] and [[Stalinism]].  (Kindle, loc 16). 

He criticizes this approach, saying that the historical process of class struggle is the real driver, not the methods used by this or that class. He notes that armies in a battle are more or less symmetrical but represent opposing forces (loc 25). 

# Marxist amoralism and eternal truths
Trotsky turns to those who counterpose the 'amoral' behavior of the revolutioaries with supposed eternal criteria that exist outside the historical process. However, he continues, where can we find such critieria? He follows this logical argument to its conclusion, that only God can provide such critieria that have existed since before the human race (loc 42). 

# "The end justifies the means"
Trotsky analyzes the morality of the Jesuits, and then turning back to the workers' movement, says that Social Democrats and centrists appear as quack doctors besides the Bolshevik as physician - he says that the former are unwilling to think things through to the end and seek to replace determination and struggle with a miracle. The Bolsheviks are warriors, he thunders, while the others are meek shopkeepers of socialism (loc 78). 

# Jesuitism and utilitarianism
Turning back to the question of ends justifying means, Trotksy explains that that poses another question: what justifies the end? Introducing a [[dialectics|dialectic]], he says that in life the ends and means continually trade places - democracy was the "end" of the class struggle (the aim), and then became the means of the class struggle (loc 105). 

In the author's view, the ruling class of every epoch forces *its* ends onto society, and uses official morality to defend and justify these ends, classifying all means which contradict these ends as immoral (loc 114). 

# "Moral precepts obligatory upon all"
Trotsky proclaims that anyone who wants to move beyond religion and superstition must accelt that morality is a product of historical development, and that it serves social interests. In a society with contradictory interests, he continues, morality must be contradictory based on the class character of that morality (loc 114). 

He gives an example, that of war - in normal times, he says, a murderer is punished, but in wartime, murder is rewarded and is even obligatory (loc 132). 

Criticizing the [[Kant proposed the categorical imperative|categorical imperative of Kant]], Trotsky says that it's merely a "shell without content" because any norm obligatory upon all ignores class - and to Trotsky, class surpasses humanity in terms of solidarity. He says that "the solidarity of workers... is incomparably more "categoric" than human solidarity in general" (loc 139).

Summarizing his view so far, the author says that the bourgeoisie is much more conscious of its class than the proletariat, and feels deeply the need to impress its own morality upon the rest of society in order to survive. The appeal to abstract norms, he says, is a deliberate attempt at deception by a class who knows its subjects have nothing in common with them (loc 139). 

# The crisis in democratic morality
Trotsky investigates the relationship between the context of the [[Germany|German]] social democratic movement, and the morality of its leaders. He says that as the movement grew during a time of plenty, the outward relations between the classes softened, and an ethic of collaboration had space to develop. He explains that this influenced the "common sense" of the period (loc 150). 

# "Common sense"
Trotsky argues that under certain limitations, common sense (the amalgomation of experiences one has directly had, or been told, that define our perception of how things work) can be an adequate way to get around the world. However, he specifies, when this common sense goes beyond its limits and attempts to grasp more complex things, it utterly fails and transforms into total stupidity (loc 172). [[Common sense has limitations]]. 

Explaining the reason for this, Trotsky says that common sense operates only on unchanging magnitudes, while in reality, [[Change is omnipresent]]. On the other hand, he continues, dialectics is able to analyze phenomena in their *development* rather than their stable existance. He exclaims that there is nothing more "flat, stale, self-satisfied, and cynical" than the unchanging rules and regulations of common sense (loc 194). 

# Moralists and the GPU
Trotsky blasts the "friends of the [[Russia|USSR]]" for covering up the Moscow Trials (loc 212). 

# The disposition of political chessmen
Continuing his attack on the hypocrites, Trotsky says that their retreat to the world of abstract values, expressed in the criticism of the Left Opposition as well as Stalin, still aids the work of the bureaucracy in crushing the former (loc 235). 

While the Stalinists have a very flimsy adherence to the rule of law, Trotsky continues, this merely frightens the liberals in easy times, and the petty bourgeois elements in the west will still line up behind the Stalinists when they fear the workers (loc 242). 

Turning to the Anarchists, Trotsky criticizes them for siding with the Stalinists in the [[Spain|Spanish]] civil war under the pretext that the Trotskyists are identical to the Stalinists. He explains that the more honest Anarchists admit that they're being bribed with weapons. The end, in this case, he says, is not revolution, but the salvaging of a bourgeois state under attack (loc 258). 

# Stalinism - a product of the old society
Trotsky argues that when attacking the USSR, critics compare the concrete historical circumstance of Soviet development to some kind of abstact democracy that has never existed. The author says that bourgeois democracy did not come into the world through the democratic road, but the road of [[Bonapartism]], and thus has no moral advantage over the Soviet Union (loc 272). 

Continuing this argument, he says that contrasting a specific historical period with an idealized democratic system is like comparing the pain of childbirth to the pleasures of life (loc 280). 

He attacks attempts to lump Bolshevism and Stalinism together, saying that neither can be removed from their historical contexts (loc 288). 

Turning to an analysis of reaction, he says that reactions tend to nourish and strengthen the reactionary elements that the revolution couldn't kill outright. For the USSR, that meant the bureaucratic apparatus (loc 295). 

He says that the task of a Marxist, the creation of a revolutionary party, is impossible if one is trapped within the bounds of bourgeois morality (loc 302). 

Trotsky lambasts the centrists between reformism and revolutionism, saying that these people recognize the need for revolution as Kant recognizes the categorical imperative - in theory, but not in real life (loc 317). 

He says that of course, we should aim for a society where lies, violence, and murder are not necessary. However, he continues, this is only possible through revolution, a messy process that requires all three. To Trotsky, the fact that therefore all revolution is immoral from the standpoint  of the bourgeois morality merely means that the latter is inherently counter-revolutionary (loc 333).

# Revolution and the institution of hostages
Trotsky discusses Lincoln in passing, saying that his significance lies in his willingness to do what needed to be done in order to satisfy the needs of historical progress during the Civil War (loc 356). 

# "Morality of the Kaffirs"
After a discussion of the morality of the Kaffirs, apparently referring to Africans, Trotsky says that the whole weight of reaction is bearing down on the shoulders of the [[Fourth International]] (loc 409). 

# The 'amoralism' of Lenin
Trotsky attacks critics who attempt to argue that since Lenin advised the Bolsheviks to use subterfuge to remain in the unions, that means Stalinism and Leninism are identical. The author claims that instead, subterfuge in this case was a valid defense against a reformist bureaucracy (loc 424).

Trotsky says that bourgeois "socialists" can't understand the relationship between a Bolshevik and the party. He says that to a Bolshevik, the party is everything, whereas to a petty bourgeois, it is nothing. This causes, he continues, the petty bourgeois to look down upon the Bolshevik when the latter places the interests of the party as the highest moral criterion (loc 446). 

> Lenin refused to recognize moral norms established by slave-owners for their slaves and never observed by the slave-owners themselves; he called upon the proletariat to extend the class struggle into the moral sphere too. Whoever fawns before precents established bty the enemy will never vanquish that enemy (loc 461)!

# An instructive episode
...

# Dialectic interdependence of ends and means
Trotsky says that a means can only be justified by its end, but that the end must also be justified. He argues that from the standpoint of the proletariat, an end is only justified if it increases the power of humanity over nature, and leads to the abolition of the power of man over man (loc 499). 

He argues that means are only permissible if they *really* lead to these things. Therefore, to Trotsky, only means that unite the proletariat, teach them their power, fill them with contempt of the old order, including the old morality, and prepare them for revolution are morally acceptable in the world of politics (loc 506). 

Of course, he says, there is no mechanical formula to tell the moral features of this or that action - we must use our brains to determine if a means accords with the above ends (loc 514). 

Examining individual terror, Trotsky says that under pre-revolutionary conditions it is impermissable, since it alienates the workers and causes them to shrink back. Howerver, he adds, under conditions of civil war, it can be a useful tool to aid in the smashing of reaction (loc 528). 

> The liberation of the workers can come only through the workers themselves. There is, therefore, no greater crime than deceiving the masses, palming off defeats as victories, friends as enemies, bribing workers' leaders, fabricating legends, staging false trials, in a word, doing what the Stalinists do (loc 536). 

Trotsky concludes with a discussion on the moral satisfaction of participating in the struggle for [[socialism]]: 

> Not all who will reach that shore, many will drown. But to participate in this movement with open eyes and with an intense will - only this can give the highest moral satisfaction to a thinking being (loc 551)!
