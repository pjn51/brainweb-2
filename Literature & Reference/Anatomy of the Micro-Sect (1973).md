# Introduction
The author, [[Draper]], says that in order to discuss sects, we must first define the term. The author criticizes the left for often using "sect" as an insult, just meaning a group that one doesn't like. The author says that many people refer to something that doesn't exist in an organized form as a "movement," when the author says the "[[USA|American]] socialist movement" doesn't "move" at all, and shouldn't be called a movement. 

[[Draper defines a sect via three characteristics]]. The author defines a sect as a group that claims to embody the socialist movement, is a membership organization, and whose boundary is set rigidly by the points in its political program rather than by its relation to the social struggle. 

Contrasting this formation to a [[workers' party]], the author asserts that the latter is not simply an electoral organization, but an organization that really is the political arm of decisive sectors of the working class" in motion as it is."

> I think this definition of a sect is flawed. By this definition, were [[the Bolsheviks]] a sect? Perhaps not because they didn't claim to "embody the socialist movement." But their membership was certainly rigidly defined by agreement with the party program. 
> The issue I have with this definition of a sect is it doesn't take [[dialectics]] into account. I think that a sect is a group that isn't using a dialectical, dynamic approach to the class struggle, and will therefore be hopelesssly victim to either [[ultraleftism]] or [[opportunism]] as the workers move. 

# About the road to an American socialist movement
The author notes that seeing as there are socialists in the [[USA]] but no socialist movement, that many would have the urge to go and create one. But the author claims that historical fact tells us that nobody can simply 'create' a revolution. 

The author argues that any attempt to create a movement by fiat would simply turn into another sect alongside all the others. 

The author admits that they have no secret solution to this problem, but say that they have some ideas about the direction in which we should search for a solution.

# 1. The road forward
The author asserts that a socialist movement will only become a possibility in the US when "its bases are matured by social-political conditions." The author calls for the development of active socialist elements that could help the movement to crystalize when it is ready to organically emerge. 

The author claims that every socialist movement "has been the outcome of the fusion of spontaneity and leadership, of naturally developed elements and conscious organization."

To the author, this means that we cannot simply wish a movement into existance, but we also cannot sit idly by and wait for it to appear. The author wants us to ensure that we are not "sterilizing the ground on which the seeds of the movement might germinate" by engaging in the formation of sects. 

# 2. Fragmentation
The author observes that there are more sects today (1973) than ever before, and they are splitting and increasing in number all the time. The author outlines two main trends that they see in these sects: [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] splinter groups, and "Maoist-Castroite" grouuplets.

The author characterizes the Trotskyist variety as tending towards "super sophistication in Marxism and futility in practice." 

As for the Maoist-Castroite variety, the author says that they tend to have "amnesia regarding the Marxist tradition, ignorance of the socialist experience, and extreme primitivism." The author says that as these organizations' 'socialism' is basically bureaucratic dictatorship, they also don't really want a class movement, preferring the formation of "a band of Maximum Leaders" that seeks to bestow its own rule over the masses. 

Contunuing in his critiques, the author says that since these neo-[[Stalinism|stalinists]] want to bridle the upsurge of the movement and ride it into a despotic rule, they prefer to orient towards the [[peasantry]] as this class has less initiative and capacity for making its own decisions. 

# 3. The classic sect
The author says that the classic sects (as opposed to the neo-stalinist ones) break down into one of two archetypes: Trotskyist or social-democratic. 

The author quotes [[Marx]] on the defining characteristics of these sects, that the sect "counterposes its sect criterion of programmatic points against the real movement of the workers in the class struggle, which may not measure up to its high demands." 

The author counterposes this approach with what he says is Marx's preferred approach: to look to the lines of struggle calculated to move decisive sectors of the [[proletariat]] into action. The author claims that it was Marx's persepective that this clash between the workers and the [[bourgeoisie]] (as well as the latter's servants) that would elevate the [[class consciousness]] of the workers to the level of the socialist revolutionary program. 

The author argues that the most important test for sectarians in the US is their relationship with the [[unions]], as this is the only working class movement in existence. 

# 4. Sects and trade unions
The author comments that the sect-soclalist has always felt a "soul-torn difficulty" when it comes to the trade unions, since the members of these organizations usually reject socialism. 

The author says that socialist history can be divided beween the [[reformism|reformists]], who supported unionism since it was in line with their limited demand worldview, and the "would-be revolutionaries" who the author says came up with all sorts of arguments for why the unions were bad. 

The author argues that the basic Marxist strategy for movement building is to weld together the class movement for immediate demands, and to permeate this movement with educational propaganda for social revolution.

Arguing that this lesson was all but forgotten in "the best days of the Marxist movement," the author says the Sixties in the US totally abandoned this knowledge. 

The author outlines a few examples of the sectarian approach to movement building, which I can summarize as just being individualist, full of [[moralism]], and inneffective.

# 5. The rut we are in
The author turns to possible ways out of the sectarian crisis of the 70s. First, he criticizes the idea that all the sects should just unite, saying that this would 1) be impossible, 2) waste everyones' time, and 3) turn into one giant sect at the end. 

The second possibility that the author dismantles is the idea that a new party, without programmatic demands, is needed. The author criticizes this because he says at the first sign of trouble, the party would implode as everyone disagrees on what to do. 

# 6. What then?
The author describes the "sect mentality:" that the sect will grow and grow because of the correctness of its ideas, and then it will gradually become a mass party and be able to lead the workers to victory. The author argues that this has never happened. 

The author turns to history, arguing that [[Bolsheviks]] were not a sect that grew by accretion. He says that when [[Lenin]] went abroad in 1900, he never sought to set up an ideological grouplet of his own, he sought to set up a Marxist "political center," in the form of the *Iskra* publication. 

The author says that *Iskra* wrote about "full revolutionary Marxism," but called for an all-inclusive socialist party that it would be merely one tendency within. 

The author quotes Lenin: "Before we can unite, and in order that we may unite, we must firmly draw the lines of demarcation between the various groups [tendencies]." The author says that while Lenin wanted lines of demarcation, he didn't want these lines drawn with organizational walls bounding them. 

> [!note]
> Would this author have been in favor of the Bolsheviks staying separate from the Mensheviks? Seems doubtful. 

Turning to *Iskra,* the author explains the political function of the publication, and how workers who agreed with the views of *Iskra* became political centers of their own, working in their own social circles. 

The author says that Lenin's course was always to maintain a uncompromising revolutionary Marxist political center that could operate within a broad, multi-tendency movement and win a majority there on the basis of its ideas and the events of the struggle. 

# 7. The political center
The author now turns towards recommendations, first to the "individual socialist." They recommend that an isolated socialist, rather than joining whichever sect is active in their area, should simply develop a socialist circle around themselves wherever they are, particularly in their workplace.

The author says that this is needed because the American workers movement needs the crystallization of an organized militant opposition within the trade unions. The author cautions us not to think of this opposition as a radical or socialist one, because labeling ourselves as such will turn many workers away, even those who would develop a socialist consciousness through struggle in this opposition. 

The author also argues that this oppostion must be clear on its loyalty to trade unionism overall, since the sectarians have made such a show of discrediting themselves by sabotaging unions. 

The author asserts that what the movement needs right now is a network of informal or formal socialist circles which have an integral relation to the real struggles that people are carrying on in their daily lives. 

Elaborating on their advice, the author says that once such a circle is established, it may look around to find support and guidance from some sort of political center, one that can supply it with literature or guidance. The author gives some examples of these political centers, including *Iskra.*

The author stresses that a political center doesn't have to be a sect, but it certainly can be. If it is a sect that you rely on, the author advises, don't join, but rely on them for advice, and feel free to choose to rely on more than one political center. 

The author argues that there is a better foundation for the American socialist movement to arise out of a network of informal circles rather than the current sect system. 

> [!note]
> Overall this seems to be very interesting. I think their definition of a sect lacks the clarity that I'm looking for, but it seems that an organic network of circles that they describe would indeed allow the organic formation of a movement to take root within it, and it would be flexible to the ebbs and flows of the movement as consciousness changes. 
> 
> It seems that this organizational framework isn't rooted in [[idealism]] since it accepts that the greater movement will arise due to a multitude of factors, and that this organizational structure is merely the conscious portion of those factors. 
> 
> I would think that the [[IMT]] does sort of fit into this conception. We argue for the creation of a multi-tendency workers party, and we function in the way that the author describes a political center to function.
