# Review
This masterwork deals with an in-depth history of [[Russia]] from [[trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theorist, [[Alan Woods]]. He seamlessly weaves together the historical narrative with the lessons that he argues we should learn from each turn of events in seeking to re-create a Bolshevik tendency today. Out of any political theory I've read, none illustrates its arguments or explains them in as much depth as this one. 

Overall, this is simultaneously an excellent history and an excellent guide to action in building the forces of [[Marxism]] in the modern world.

# Introduction
## Why study the history of Bolshevism?
The Russian revolution is really important. It was similar, yet distinct from previous bourgeois revolutions. 

## Is a party needed?
Yes. Without [[Bolsheviks]], the fury of the Russian working class would likely have dissipated in a series of ineffective and sporadic outbursts, as other working class furies have in the past.

## About the present work
Alan Woods is a committed Marxist who declares his bias openly. This bias does not prevent him from being objective, as he seeks to expose the flaws of the Bolsheviks so that we won’t repeat them. 

This book seeks to use non-Bolshevik sources wherever possible, as well as relying heavily on the extensive writings of [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]]. Even bourgeois sources are used, when they are objective. 

## How the Bourgeois ‘Explain’ October
Whether bourgeois historians call it a coup, or say that the masses were too stupid to realize what was happening to them, they have no real explanation for how this  event came to pass. They are too scared to admit that their real project is not historical analysis, but to act as a warning against revolution, against any sort of rebellion against the capitalists system. This admission would make their position more clear, but good luck getting them to come clean. 

## The Stalin School of Falsification
Stalinists seek to conflate [[Stalinism]] and Bolshevism, as do some bourgeois detractors of the revolution. If Stalinism is Bolshevism, why did [[Stalin]] need to execute so many Bolsheviks to retain power?

The purpose of history under the bureaucracy was to glorify the ruling caste and cement their narrative that Stalin’s clique was the authentic descendant of the Bolshevik party and the ideas of Lenin.

# Part One: The Birth of Russian Marxism
## The Death of an Autocrat
The Russian Czar was assassinated by [[Narodniks|Narodniks]] in 1881. They were ‘populists’ who thought that the peasantry could be a revolutionary force against the decaying autocracy, while avoiding the immature Russian [[bourgeoisie]]. 

The Russian [[peasantry]] had recently been freed from slavery, but like sharecroppers in the South, this was not a great arrangement. In some ways, it was actually worse than being tied directly to the land. The peasantry was freed in order to stave off further peasant revolts that had convulsed Russia periodically.

However, the peasantry didn’t have enough class [[class consciousness]] to play an independent role. The urban intelligentsia was also unable to play an independent role, but were sensitive to the growing discontent. They were the foundation of the Narodniks, who wanted to “go to the people” and spark revolution. 

## Going to the People 
The narodniks thought that the peasantry was naturally revolutionary, and would rally around them if they went to the villages and propagandized. In fact, they thought that the proletariat could never be revolutionary! However, the intellectual youths arrived and found that nobody wanted to listen. They were reported to the authorities and arrested or worse.

The peasantry is not naturally revolutionary, seeking mainly to own their own land and become petit bourgeois. This was demonstrated by the inability of wide-ranging peasant revolts to really do anything besides redistribute land. They were never able to make common cause with the urban proletariat.

However, the narodniks set the stage for a new wave of activism, and their selflessness and dedication set an example for later Russian Marxists to follow. 

As their movement fizzled, the peasants were 'emancipated' in a brutal acceleration of capitalism. Many peasants sought jobs in the cities. This laid the foundations for the first unions, smashed by the tsar, whose leaders were arrested or killed. A class of urban revolutionaries was emerging. 

## 'Land and Freedom'
The narodniks began to reconstitute themselves in a more formal organization, called *Zemlya i Volya*. They had more structure and central direction. While still based on a peasant revolution, they started conducting more urban work. The workers section was led by [[Plekhanov]].

This urban work proved more successful, but the organization didn’t really know what to make of this, and were still bogged down with their centering of the peasants. 

A split emerged between those who wanted to peacefully propagandize the peasants and those who believed in “propaganda of the deed” and veered in the direction of clandestine [[terrorism]]. They formed a new organization, called Narodnaya Volya. 

The individualistic terrorism of this group didn’t have a real theoretical base, it just sought to accelerate history and accelerate the struggle for demands raised by liberals. It was condemned by Marxists, who called these terrorists “liberals with bombs.”

Marxists see revolution as a conscious act by the working class itself, acting in its own interest. Therefore, action is only progressive if it raises the working class’ opinion of its own role, and regressive if it lowers the workers’ opinion of their place in the struggle. Terrorism causes the workers to feel farther from the struggle than ever before, and that’s why terrorism is ultimately closer to [[liberalism]] than Marxism. 

## The Birth of Russian Marxism
Those who broke with the terrorist sect of the Narodniks formed the *Cherny Peredel*. They tried to organize factory workers in the cities, but even the advanced workers were leaning more towards terrorism. Then, the police arrested basically the whole organization, ending the non-terrorist Narodnik movement once and for all. 

Meanwhile, *Narodnaya Volya* seemed to make great gains. Their tiny organization had succeeded in virtually imprisoning the Tsar in his palace, and their platform now included more political demands, which was a step forward. However, they didn’t connect these demands with socialism. 

The more successful assasinations and bombings the Narodniks carried out, the stronger the repression of the Russian state became. A whole generation of revolutionary youths were executed or sent to Siberia, while the state simply replaced each police chief with a new one who was even more violent. 

Even though Plekhanov was “a Narodnik to the fingertips,” he began to engage more seriously with the works of Marx and Engels while he was in exile in the 1880s. When he returned, his new ideas were seen as a threat by the leadership of the Narodniks, who prevented his group from joining as a formal tendency within the movement. 

Casted out by the Narodniks, the Marxists formed the Group for the Emancipation of Russian Labor. They only had 5 members, and soon shrank to 3. They had no allies in Russia, and even the Marxists in Europe thought that the Russian group had no hope of building socialism in such a backwards country. 

## The Emancipation of Labor Group
This group was tiny, and followed a [[cadre]] building strategy of hammering home the fundamental ideas of Marxism while gaining members by the ones and twos. The Narodniks accused them of being more interested in challenging other activists than fighting the state, a complaint we hear about cadre organizations to this day. 

For 20 years, the Group basically suffered in silence, and this suffering would get in the way of them expanding their work beyond narrow propaganda activities later. But they did eventually have an effect on the Narodniks. The leaders of the Narodniks had moved back to the right, and some of them even declared openly that they weren’t revolutionaries anymore. There were many members looking for an alternative, and the Marxists provided one. By the 1890s, Plekhanov’s name and ideas became well-known throughout the Russian activist world. 

## Combined and Uneven Development
Russia was rapidly developing towards capitalism, under the domination of European [[capital]], along the lines Lenin describes in [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]]. Side by side with pre-feudal and feudal social relations, there sprang up modern factories financed by British and French investors. Patterns and routines of life that had been unchanged for generations were being obliterated in the blink of an eye. 

The peasantry, once freed from serfdom, began to stratify into semi-proletarians and [[kulak]]s. 

The new proletariat began to flex its muscles, as a series of strikes rippled across the country in the 1880s. These strikes resulted in concessions, as the state saw the potential power of the workers. 

These strikes revealed that the army of the proletariat was ready to fight. However, they also revealed that there was no professional leadership ready to direct their efforts. The most advanced layer of the workers realized this and began to prepare.

## The Period of Small Circles
Marxist groups emerged across the country, with the goal of educating the workers under the cover of ‘adult education classes’ where they were supposedly teaching basic math and reading, writing, etc. These groups were tiny and would regularly be broken up, but they would always pop up again and again. 

Then, in the 1890s, a famine swept the country at the same time as an upturn in the industrial economy (paradoxically) led to a massive strike wave and clashes with police across Russia. 

Liberals called for a representative body to be elected, and Plekhanov and other Marxists used this call as a slogan to rally the working class, turning the reformist ideas of the liberals into a more militant and combative idea. 

Far from Stalinist “people’s fronts” which subordinate the demands of the working class to those of the liberal bourgeoisie, this tactic was to “march separately, strike together” in order to maximize impact while maintaining ideological clarity, and never ceasing to attack the liberals for their flaws and missteps. 

## From Propaganda to Agitation
Plekhanov saw that the time was right to move from an orientation towards propagandizing small study groups, to a campaign of agitation among the masses. Many disagreed, having gotten too accustomed to their old secretive habits. 

Marxists do not push aside the struggle for reforms under capitalism. The difference between Marxists and the reformists is that Marxists acknowledge that the gains of workers can only be made by mobilizing the working class as its own actor, and these gains can only be cemented by going all the way, by breaking the power of the ruling class. 

The working class in St. Petersburg (mainly steel workers) and Moscow (textiles) were very downtrodden. During upswings in the economy, strike actions would buy them some concessions, but these would be reversed at the next economic contraction. During this time, oppression based on nationality and [[religion]] also intensified. Lenin called Tsarist Russia a “prison-house of nations.”

The workers movement in the western regions of the Russian empire (Poland, Lithuania) was complicated by the national question. 

## The Jewish Workers Movement
Polish workers formed a new party, Proletariat. They set off a wave of strikes ending in the suppression of the party and the execution of the leaders. 

During this time, the Jewish population was doubly oppressed. Pogroms were organized by the state against them, and they were barred from many occupations and most forms of education. 

This oppression led to Jewish workers being open to socialist ideas. Many leaders of the workers movement were Jewish. Many Jews were organized into mutual aid networks that now used their funds not to buy copies of the Torah, but to help with strikes and labor disputes. 

## The Petersburg League of Struggle
In 1893, the Petersburg Social Dems were recovering from the arrest of their leader, and were basically focused on education. 

[[Lenin]] arrived in '93 and began teaching in this network of study circles. The way he operated was to explain theory to the members for the first half, then to answer questions about their lives and workplace issues for the second half. In this way, he connected the theoretical with the practical. 

These study circles were valuable, but also tended to emphasize theoretical education over practical work, which turned some workers off, who wanted to get to the action. 

As the transition was made towards agitation, activists tried their best to link specific workers’ struggles and demands with broader political questions. 

## ‘Legal Marxism’
Nicholas II ascended to the throne in 1894. He promised to continue the path of autocracy just like his father, dismaying liberals who hoped he would be a reformer. 

As Marxist ideas began to circulate more widely, a section of the bourgeois intellectuals grabbed ahold of them. They were fascinated with Marxism in an academic way, failing to grasp its revolutionary content, and liked how it could serve as a justification for the acceleration towards capitalism. 

This strange adoption of certain parts of Marxism allowed revolutionaries a certain degree of legal protection. They could now publish in the legal journals, as long as they didn't go too far. These new intellectuals also gave significant funding to the movement. 

The Legal Marxists failed to see, just as [[Mensheviks]] and [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] later failed to see, how even though conditions to create socialism were absent in Russia, a socialist revolution there could usher in revolution in Europe. This European revolution would lay the foundation for socialism, which would in turn allow Russia to proceed past capitalism entirely. 

## Lenin and the Group for the Emancipation of Labor
Lenin travelled to go invite the Emancipation of Labor group back from exile, telling them that Russia was ready for Marxist ideas. Unfortunately, right as they were about to start their new Marxist journal, they all got arrested. 

The arrest of all the “old-timers” of the movement lowered the political educational level overall. The new leaders started to be swept away by recent successes, and started to think that instead of leading the workers, the role of a revolutionary party should be to just help them out from behind. They started to think that maybe politics were too complicated for the average worker to figure out, and they should focus on economic issues alone. 

## The Economist Controversy
The mood of “[[Economism]]” was emerging among the new layers of Russian youth entering the movement. They wanted to cater to the common denominator of the Russian workers. This was fundamentally opportunistic, seeking a shortcut to building a movement. They wanted to divorce the political struggle against the Czar and capitalism in general, and the individual strike movements that were emerging. 

## *Rabochaya Mysl*
This was the name of a new journal that showed the ideas of the Economists. The vetran Marxists were really worried about this opportunistic trend that threatened to get rid of the revolutionary party altogether. Instead, the Economists wanted to totally forget about theory, and lower their political level to that of the average worker. Lenin wanted the revolutionary party to be a force made up of the most politically advanced workers, not the average!

Further discrediting the Economists, the workers themselves were more advanced than the Economists would admit. Many strikers wanted to fight the government directly, seeing the connection between the state and their own daily oppression in the workplace. 

The theoretical flaws in the Economist movement meant that they weren't really able to guide or accelerate the class struggle. Instead, they began to tail-end the movement, following it wherever it was going on its own. Because of this, they were able to grow as the class struggle intensified on its own throughout Russia. 

## Bernstein's Revisionism
Because of a prolonged calm period in European capitalism, and the development of a case of well off labor leaders, revisionism had gained traction in the German Social Democrats, led by Bernstein. Capitalism seemed to be doing great, and they thought maybe Marx was wrong about an inevitable collapse.

Plekhanov and the Russian Marxists were outraged by this trend. They looked to [[Kautsky]], a well respected orthodox Marxist in Germany, to fight back. Instead, Kautsky didn't seem that angry. Kautsky was more of a scholar than a revolutionary, and saw Bernstein as a mistaken friend rather than a threat. 
Economists in Russia seized this revisionism to justify their opportunism.

## The First Congress of the [[RSDLP]]
The first meeting of the leaders of the various Social Democratic groups was 9 people in a Minsk apartment in 1898. They agreed to form a unified newspaper. 

The reason that the meeting was held in Minsk was that the Jewish workers organization, the Bund, was strong there. The Bund wasn't set up along Marxist lines, and was more of a trade union. But it had way more resources than the other groups. 

National and ehthic divisions we're becoming an issue in the movement. The Bund refused to organize among non-jews, and most social Democratic orgs refused to work across borders. 

Unfortunately, the new Congress was smashed only a week into its infancy by the police in Kiev. This caused the local committees to sink back into their routines, with little communication between them. 

## *Rabocheye Dyelo*
As repression smashed the Marxist orgs within Russia, the center of gravity of the movement was shifting to the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad, an organization of exiled Marxists in Europe. 

In 1898, the Economists had a majority at the convening of this Union, and used it to seize control from the veterans of the Group for the Emancipation of Russian Labor. 

The Economists started a new newspaper for the Union, which was pretty shitty. It was based in Paris and Geneva. 

The Economists invented the now notorious theory of stages of revolutionary development. This theory said that before the workers were ready for revolution, they had to go through a stage of economic agitation, then agitation linking economic with political demands, and then a final political agitation stage. This theory was used by the Stalinists later. 

Finally sensing the danger that the Economists posed, Plehkanov awakened from a daze and began to attack their ideas ruthlessly. Lenin and the others in exile followed the events closely, and were concerned with how much the Economists had corrupted the party. 

The economists were going full "[[class independence|class collaboration]]" mode. Not good. The working class must develop organizations that follow working class interests alone.

The organization at the time was very centralized and not so democratic. This was necessary in order to keep things secretive. However, economist ideas were poisoning the workers against the intellectual members. 

By 1900, Economism dominated the movement. However, due to the waves of arrests, workers had moved up the ranks and in the process learned to trust their own instincts. Some study circles began to come out against Economism. 

## The Birth of *Iskra*
Lenin and some other exiles traveled to Switzerland to meet Plekhanov. They found that he was really bitter and suspicious of them. 

Their new newspaper, *Iskra*, and philosophical journal, *Zarya*, came out strongly against Economism and all other tendencies of the Russian left.

While Plekhanov was a firebrand, Lenin was much more flexible when dealing with people. He always wanted to make use of people's talents to build the movement, even if they disagreed. However, if he thought that someone was an irreconcilable enemy of Marxism, he never hesitated to cast them out. 

*Iskra* became very popular. The workers loved to hear updates about regional struggles from all across Russia, often months delayed as agents smuggled news to Europe. 

## [[What is to be Done (1902)|What is to be Done?]]
Lenin published this work as a refutation of the Economist ideas of the time. However, Alan Woods thinks he went a little too far when he said that workers can only develop "trade union consciousness" without external prodding by Marxist intellectuals. This is more of a two sided, dialectical relationship. At this time, Lenin was still quoting Kautsky, who he thought was the best defender of orthodox Marxism. 

The essential message called for the training of cadre. These professionals can raise the level of consciousness of the workers during key moments, when the working class is looking for answers. 

## A New Awakening
At the turn of the century, the working class was strengthened by an influx of workers into the factories. This was part of the cause for an upsurge in strikes, which were taking on a more political character. 

In 1902 and into 1903, a crisis began. A general strike rippled across southern Russia, and the dissent spread from there to the peasants. It took 10,000 soldiers to pacify the region. The peasants burned the homes of landlords all across the region. This attitude spread into the mostly liberal student population, who were becoming more radical in their outlook, and more willing to ally with the workers. Even the well-off students’ movement was crushed and many were sentenced to army conscription and hard labor. 

The Economists didn’t like to engage with any movement outside the factories, and ones that didn't make purely economic demands. However, Lenin viewed the students as a possible auxiliary force for the working class. 

The [[Socialist Revolutionaries|Socialist Revolutionary]] party was created. This was the new organization of the revolutionary petty bourgeois, reconstituted from the ashes of the Narodniks. They began to engage in a campaign of individual terrorism. Lenin and others welcomed their support of the struggle, but never hesitated to criticize the “blind alley” of terrorist tactics. One representative of the state, once assassinated, will easily be replaced. 

This era also marked the first formal organizations of the new Russian bourgeoisie. They started their own illegal publication, *Liberation*, which called for the introduction of a limited monarchy and a new constitution. However, the state didn't believe that the liberals could pacify the masses, and usually chose to use repression instead of reforms to do so. 

## Tensions on the Editorial Board
Lenin’s aggressive attitude towards the liberals revealed tensions within *Iskra*. There was a growing need to change tactics and some members were stuck in the past. At this time, *Iskra* was a growing organization of agents who were nomadic and moved across Russia, organized around the newspaper. These agents had the difficult task of evading the secret police while simultaneously distributing their ideas to the population, all while trying to outmaneuver the Economists who would bar them from attending workers’ committees where the Economists still had a majority. 

## The Economists in Retreat
The remaining economists, in alliance with the Bund who wanted more power independent of the party, tried to outmaneuver *Iskra* but failed.

Iskra was facing communication challenges and tension within the editorial board. Lenin wanted to be more practical and concrete,while Plekhanov was more vague and academic. 
Lenin wanted to get Trotsky on the Board, but Plekhanov said no. 

The RSDLP met for a congress to decide the organizations future. Iskra-ites were one faction, and there was a right wing of the party. This is the congress where the split between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks started to take shape. 

## The real meaning of the 1903 split
It was purely organizational and very minor at first. Only much later would this moment be seen as the first inkling of a larger division in the RSDLP. 

The board of Iskra was disbanded, and Lenin voted for the new board to have only the more practical and dedicated members (him, Plekhanov, and [[Martov]]) on the board. The other three hadn't really been contributing that much anyway. The bolsheviks and mensheviks were again split on this. 

# Part Two: The First Russian Revolution
## January 9, 1905
The 1905 revolution would be a 'dress rehearsal' for the events of 1917. At the start of the scenario, the Bolsheviks were in a sorry state. The committeemen were too hesitant to involve new layers in the leadership of the organization, leading to widespread calls for more full-timers from abroad. 

## 'Zubatovism'
The head of the secret police, Zubatov, had the great idea of redirecting revolutionary energy into legal 'police unions' that would serve to trap revolutionaries. He even visited Marxists in prison to encourage them to lead such efforts.

However, the flexibility of the Bolsheviks let them use this development to their advantage. Revolutionaries entered these highly reactionary institutions and used them to pose radical demands. In the end, Zubatov had to shut down his own unions by force. 

## Father Gapon
Gapon, a priest, began to organize workers. His organization grew huge, but he was very confused in his perspective. Nevertheless, he played a progressive role for a time. The Marxists had no direct influence within his Assembly, but many workers had heard the ideas of the Social Democrats, and naturally began to raise those kinds of demands. 

## The Putilov Strike
Despite the confusion of Father Gapon, the situation was heading towards a politically motivated general strike. Gapon floated the naive idea of presenting the Tsar with a petition, and many Social Democratic ideas found their way into the petition because of the workers. They decided to simply go give this petition to the Tsar directly. 

## Bloody Sunday
Predictably, the Tsar didn't take kindly to thousands marching to his palace, and ordered the military and police to fire on them, killing or wounding thousands. Father Gapon overnight turned from a lover of 'The Little Father' to a revolutionary, calling for an armed uprising. 

The revolutionaries who were before ignored or even harassed by the workers suddenly found an eager audience with workers who had learned more in 12 hours than the preceding 12 years. 

## Revolution Begins
Across all of the Russian Empire, strikes were declared and cities rose up. The RSDLP was still in a bad position to take advantage of the momentum. The committeemen, more used to secretive propaganda circles than mass work, didn't trust the fresh layers surging into their organizations. Fighting against this perspective, Lenin said that revolutionary events themselves would teach these newly minted revolutionaries how to be Bolsheviks.

## Reunification
While the events of the revolution had moved the base of the Mensheviks far to the left, the top Mensheviks began moving back to the right almost immediatley. The RSDLP had re-combined, but there was now a serious internal division between reformist and revolutionary wings. The Mensheviks won control of most of the organization at the Fourth Party Congress because many Bolsheviks had been arrested en route to the Congress. 

## The Debate on the Land Question
Some were in favor of dividing up the land among the peasants, while Lenin was in favor of direct nationalization. He said that while the conditions for socialism in Russia were absent, the vanguard should take up the task of attempting a socialist transformation of society, and rely on a socialist revolution in Europe to carry them to the finish line. 

## Bolshevism and Menshevism
The RSDLP had grown quite large, but paradoxically its influence among the masses had decreased. The revolution had brought together all the advanced workers and youth and they were now consolidated in the party. However, the masses were disengaging from politics, and settling into a mood of apathy. 

Inside the party, the Mensheviks had control, but the Bolsheviks scored some points here and there, like the adoption of democratic centralism as a principle. 

## The Peasants' Revolt
While the peasant revolts spread like wildfire, the RSDLP argued back and forth about how best to use the peasantry as a spark to re-ignite the struggle in the towns, while the Tsar tried his best to create a new social base among the conservative peasants. He invited them into the Duma with more of a voice than the workers had, while making sure the Duma was anything but a representative democratic body. 

## To Boycott, or Not to Boycott?
The mood of the vanguard was united in calling for a boycott of the Duma. However, they had become disconnected from the mood of the masses, a phenomenon Lenin would explain in detail in [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]]. 

Meanwhile, the Cadets (the liberal bourgeois party) was showing their true colors by calling hypocritically for the Tsar to grant reforms in order to squelch the revolutionary movement. 

## Parliamentary Illusions
The Cadets and the peasant deputies controlled the Duma totally. The Cadets kept trying to make a deal with the Tsar to increase their power, trying desperatley to save the regime from its own stupidity. On the other hand, the peasants were consumed with the question of land redistribution. Far from being a stabilizing factor, as the arisocracy had thought they would be, the peasants raised the question of seizing the landlords' estates directly. This shocked the Tsar, and he decided to put a stop to what he saw as a circus. 

## The Duma Dissolved
The Tsar recruited Stolypin, a wealthy landlord, to be his new Interior Minister, and later the Chairman of the Council of Ministers in his imperial government. This guy was very repressive and loved to hang dissidents. He helped the Tsar dissolve the Duma, which was squelched with little resistance from the liberal majority. The Cadets initially called for civil disobediance, such as the refusal to pay taxes, but then backed off this idea. The Mensheviks called for strike action, but the workers ignored their cries. 

Lenin said that the workers ought to fight against Tsarist reaction, and not for bourgeois democracy. He advocated for a bloc with the peasant representatives, and they agreed to call for an armed uprising. 

## The Question of Guerella War
During 1905 and 1906, there was a lot of sporadic fighting between the state and armed workers' detachments. These fighting units were closely connected with the political organs of the workers and the workers' organizations. They usually acted to defend workers' meetings from the police and fascists, but sometimes went on the offensive to free political prisoners and attack fascists and strikebreakers. 

These fighting groups often attracted shady elements, and sometimes degenerated into organized crime bands when isolated from the movement. Other times, they were infiltrated by agent provacetours who were able to slip inside the undisciplined squads. 

During the upsurge of the movement, these fighting squads played a positive role, but now on the downswing, they were degenerating more and more. Lenin called for their dissolution when it became clear the movement was declining. 

The issue of financing remained. After the liberals saw that the workers were serious, they stopped donating [[currency|money]] to the organizations. Inspiring revolutionary figures robbed banks to pay for organizing, like Kamo. 

Kamo was a valiant figher in the 1905 revolution, he turned to this activity. He and his band of fighers robbed multiple banks in daring raids, until he was arrested in Berlin, betrayed by a police spy. He was sent to prison, where he faked insanity for months on end, even while he was tortured to produce a confession. Withstanding everything, he was sent to a mental asylum, where he promptly escaped. 

## Lenin's Attitude to Guerellaism
Lenin viewed guerella struggle as the weapon of the peasantry, not of the working class. Guerella struggle really only works in inacessible areas such as jungle or mountains where it is hard to deploy regular troops, and where the rural population can provide cover for the fighters. In this way, guerella struggle was a useful auxillary to support the workers' movement in the towns, but wouldn't be able to replace the struggle of the working class as the main mode of class struggle, for the same reasons that the peasantry was unable to play a leading role in the socialist revolution. 

Eventually, the tactic of guerella struggle and bank robbery became hinderances instead of useful tools. The RSDLP eventually ruled them to be against party discipline and forbid them. When the labor movement was reborn, it rebounded slowest in those areas where the robberies and guerellaism was most abundant. 

## The Stolypin Reaction
Stolypin pushed land reform meant to smash the communal system in favor of the strengthening of the [[kulak]] class of peasants. Most peasants hated this, and it inflamed tensions among them, while creating a new base of support for the state in the newly-expanded kulak class. 

All the parties of the left were in despair, running out of money, and splitting all over the place. Reunited in the RSDLP, the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were at each others' throats again. The right wing of the Mensheviks even wanted to fuse with the Cadets and SRs into a 'constitutional' party. 

The Tsar convened a new Duma, in which participation by the RSDLP was heavily debated. Lenin was the only one who thought they should participate at first. 

> As a general rule, you only boycott a parliament when there is a realistic prospect of replacing it with something better, as was the case in November 1917. But where this is not the case, to boycott elections *means only that the workers' party is boycotting itself*.
> - Alan Woods

The RSDLP eventually decided to participate, and had good results in the election. However, the deputies to the new Duma were mainly Mensheviks and SRs. 

Divisions began to surface between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks almost instantly. The Mensheviks supported a Cadet for speaker, while the Bolsheviks supported a Trudovik (revolutionary wing of the peasants' movement). 

## The Fifth (London) Congress
The Party met in London, having been denied permission by Denmark and Sweden to hold a meeting. The meeting lasted three weeks, and was critically important to the future of the Russian revolution.

This was the most representative meeting of European social democracy ever. There were 303 delegates, one for every 500 party members. The parties involved numbered 145 organizations! 

While most were still in their 20s or 30s, there were few who hadn't served time in prison for their beliefs. 

While the previous Congress had been dominated by the Mensheviks, this one was dominated by the Bolsheviks who had been growing in esteem among the advanced workers very fast. 

Many larger-than-life figures attended, as well as Stalin, who was still totally unknown in 1906. These included the Russian giants of course, as well as Rosa Luxemburg, and other European leaders of the various leftist organizations. 

This was the first time that there was clear-cut debate over tactics and strategy between the fully-formed Menshevik and Bolshevik camps. Up until this point, the battle had been more or less in the shadows. 

## The Debate on the Bourgeois Parties
Lenin explained that while a bourgeois revolution was on the agenda in Russia, the bourgeoisie is never a motor force of revolution. Whether the revolution is performing bourgeois tasks or proletarian tasks, the masses are *always* the force behind any revolution.

Furthermore, the bourgeoisie are even *counter-revolutionary,* even when it comes to a bourgeois revolution. They will oppose at every turn the idea of the masses taking matters into their own hands. 

Rosa sided with Lenin in this matter. Trotsky also came in on the side of the Bolsheviks here, and his short speech was commended by Lenin. However, Trotsky persisted in his mistaken belief that a split between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks could be prevented. He called for the delegates "not to get ahead of events" in their talks of splitting up. 

Political questions began to express themselves in terms of organizational ones. Faced with the forces of reaction on the march, the Mensheviks wanted to disband the illegal organizations of the Party and instead form a legal Labor Congress, similar to the Labour Party in the [[UK]]. However, the conditions facing the Labour Party were totally different than the conditions in 1907 Russia. 

Fortunatley, this was rejected by the Congress. This was not a rejection of the need to create a mass party of the working class. The role of the Party was to unite the advanced layers of the working class, and then try to find a road to the masses. To try and form a mass party by dissolving the advanced layers into the masses would be a disaster. 

The Party also insisted that the representatives in the Duma be controlled by the Central Committee, against the wishes of the Mensheviks. 

A 12-member CC was elected, consisting of 5 Bolsheviks, 4 Mensheviks, 2 Poles, and one Latvian representative 

## The Permanent Revolution
This section is an outline of the main tendencies in the Russian workers' movement before 1914 on the question of the tasks of the Russian revolution. 

The most important theory that emerged out of this question was that of the [[permanent revolution]], formalized by Trotsky and Parvus.

This theory explained that in the epoch of imperialism, the national bourgeoisie of Russia was bound too tightly to the remains of feudalism on one side, and to the interests of the imperialists on the other to accomplish any of its historical tasks in the bourgeois revolution. 

Marx had already explained that this sort of thing could happen when he talked about the German bourgeoisie. The German bourgeoisie developed much later than the French bourgeoisie. This meant that when the showdown between feudalism and the capitalists came to Germany, the German bourgeoisie didn't still speak for the masses like the French bourgeoisie could claim during the French revolution. 

Trotsky generalized this idea and applied it to the Russian context. The proletariat in Russia had developed to the point where the Russian bourgeoisie saw it as an enemy just as dangerous as the Tsar. This paralyzed them, and prevented them from playing even the mildly progressive role that the bourgeoisie had played in other bourgeois revolutions. 

We can see that the bourgeois even followed a similar path in the French and English revolutions. At first, the bourgeoisie tries to rally the masses through revolutionary-sounding ideas. Then, once power is secured, the counter-revolution arrives to crush all those who actually pursued those ideas. The success of these bourgeois revolutions wasn't because of the leading role of the bourgeoisie, it was despite of it. 

Trotsky was the first to really apply this theory to the Russian situation, and was the first to predict that workers in Russia could seize power *before* a workers' revolution in Europe. 

This was in stark contrast to the Menshevik idea of the revolution. They viewed the Russian revolution as having two stages - one bourgeois, and the second proletarian. Since the first stage was bourgeois, the bourgeoisie must lead the first stage.

Trotsky's position was that the proletariat was the force that should be (and the only force that really could be) at the head of the revolutionary movement, even if the goals to be accomplished were bourgeois-democratic. However, once in power, the proletariat would continue past the bourgeois goals onto socialist ones. Of course, these goals would be impossible to accomplish in a single country, especially one as backwards as Russia. Therefore Trotsky hoped that this turn of events would be the spark for the socialist revolution in Europe. 

Lenin largely agreed with Trotsky about the need for the proletariat to lead the revolution, but didn't yet agree that the workers could come to power in Russia before a European revolution. Instead, Lenin thought that the workers in Russia would carry out a bourgeois-democratic revolution, and would inspire the workers in western Europe to carry out a socialist revolution there. Then, the socialist bloc in Europe could help the Russian workers move past their bourgeois-democratic phase into a socialist one. 

Lenin and the Bolsheviks mainly thought the socialist revolution was impossible in Russia due to the low level of productivity and the counter-revolutionary role that would be played by the peasantry. 

After the Stalinist degeneration of the USSR, every effort was made to split Lenin's position from Trotsky's on this question, but the two were of the same mind after February 1917 on the matter. Lenin never believed in 'socialism in one country,' as we can see from his writings on internationalism. If anything, he was overly pessimistic about the ability of the Russian workers to even advance towards socialist goals!

## The June 3 Coup
The 1905 revolution had, in reality, lasted until the summer of 1907. By then, the peasant insurrection had devolved into a series of sporadic, unconnected uprisings that the state could put down one by one. 

Sensing that the time was ripe to end the whole affair, Stolypin dismissed the Second Duma, and arrested the Social Democratic faction within it. 

He introduced new electoral laws that were even more restrictive than before, to the point that the Third Duma was almost entirely reactionary. Out of 442 seats, the reactionaries had 409, and the Social Democrats had only 19. 

The Octobrists, the party of the big bourgeoisie, was led by Guchkov. They deemed it expedient to distance themselves from the Tsar directly, and aimed to shore up the weaknesses of the imperial state through legislation. However, they still supported Stolypin as the lesser-evil against the other reactionaries in the court. 

Due to their fawning over the Russian state, the Third Duma was the first one permitted to live out its full 5-year term until the election of the Fourth Duma in 1912. 

Despite his plans, Stolypin was still without a firm base of support. His 'reforms' were seen as too radical by the right, and were easily seen as a scam by the left. He was eventually assasinated by a SR-turned police informer in 1912. Many suspected that it had been a plot by the secret police. 

During this period, the workers' movement was reduced to dangerous illegal work. Waves of arrests decimated the ranks of the RSDLP. For the period of 1908-1910, blow after blow was dealt to the revolutionary organizations. 

The only advantage to this situation was that it made the composition of the party more proletarian. As the work became more dangerous and hopeless, the intellectual layer fell away and was replaced by the advanced workers themselves. 

This was the period where Stalin first rose to make a name for himself. With the total lack of experienced Party men, Lenin eagerly pounced on Stalin, who was a talented organizer but had a very narrow outlook and a low political level. This low level was shown earlier when he continued to organize expropriations past the point where it was a useful tactic, and even when it was hurting the party in the long run.

The mood was very bleak among the revolutionaries. All the most experienced and intelligent leaders were in prison or exile, if not executed. Suicide was not uncommon among the youth, who felt totally hopeless under the boot of reaction. 

Lenin was in a difficult position as well. While the RSDLP was formally united, the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were operating independently. Since the Mensheviks were in favor of liquidating all illegal work, the task fell to the Bolsheviks to maintain that sphere. 

Recognizing the need for more political independence, Lenin began publishing a Bolshevik newspaper, *Proletary.* 

## Liquidationism and Otzovism
Among the petit bourgeois layers, a mood of intense pessimism began to form. Many thought the cause of socialism was totally hopeless. 

On the Menshevik wing, this manifested itself in the idea of 'liquidationism.' Many wanted to end the illegal work, and some wanted to give up on the idea of an armed uprising altogether, and confine their work to the Duma, where they could make an alliance with the liberals. 

In the grand view, such people really just wanted to give up on the idea of socialism in Russia. They wanted to muster all the forces of Social Democracy to push through a bourgeois revolution, and thought that after 100 years or so of capitalist development, maybe revolution would be on the table. 

In the spring of 1908, the Mensheviks openly called for the dissolution of all the underground operations, and the Central Committee itself. 

Lenin often said that ultra-leftism is the price paid for opportunism. This situation was no different. At the same time that the liquidationist attitude was taking shape in the Mensheviks, another attitude was forming among the ranks of the Bolsheviks: *Otzovism.*

Some began to put forward the idea of recalling the Duma representatives and boycotting the Duma entirely. This inner dispute grew larger and larger, until it was the main topic of every meeting. 

Lenin was sucessfully arguing in favor of using the Duma as a platform for revolutionary demands, when all the Bolsheviks in the Bureau were suddenly arrested. This sent all the work in Russia into disarray, and the Mensheviks used this as an opportunity to push through the dissolution of the CC as mentioned above. 

In addition, the otzovists wanted to boycott all legal work, in addition to the Duma. Lenin called this trend "liquidationism turned inside out."

In his attempts to keep the Party on track, Lenin waged an intense struggle in support of [[dialectical materialism]] and the basics of Marxist philosophy. This is seen as strange by bourgeois historians, but Marxist philosophy is the foundation for tactics and all political analysis. The best way to prevent mistakes in action was theoretical education. 

## Mood of the Intelligentsia
The working class doesn't exist in a vaccum. The mood of other layers of society can infect the working class. 

Sections of the intellectual strata were so demoralized by the failure of the revolution that they retreated within themselves. This manifested in hedonism, mysticism, and other anti-materialist ideas. 

Many revolutionary members of the petit bourgeois retreated back to their class positions, or drowned themselves in academic studying. 

A de-facto division of [[labor]] emerged between the opponents of the revolution. Open reactionaries took up the work of justifying the Tsar's repression, while dismayed intellectual ex-revolutionaries took up the task of distorting Marxism in order to excuse their betrayal of the cause. 

These ex-Marxists singled out dialectics as their main target. As the theoretical basis of Marxist analysis, the isolation of Marxism from this concept would deal a death-blow to the revolutionary philosophy. 

These ideas began to worm their way into the RSDLP, and the Bolsheviks weren't immune. They appealed to the desire for new ideas, and new explanations. But as is so often true, they contained at their heart very old ideas, that dated back to the history of the movement. 

Lenin had the task of holding the torch of authentic Marxism in this situation. In public, he hammered these ideas brutally, but in private he went to great lengths to patiently attempt to bring along his comrades and prevent them from going astray. 

Despite Lenin's efforts, the Bolsheviks were developing big philisophical differences within the leadership. Bogdanov led the march away from dialectical materialism. 

Lenin and Plekhanov began an open war against the deviators within the Bolsheviks in 1909.

## The Bolsheviks Split
The Bolsheviks' editorial board met and openly debated the issues. Bogdanov was isolated on the board, and a majority voted with Lenin. Of course, all the votes had oppositions and abstentions, but this was relatively normal, and is acceptable in democratic proceedings. It is only [[Stalinism]] that demands unanimous public support for every Party decision. 

However in this case, the abstentions were significant. Many party members viewed these philisophical debates as hopelessly out of touch with the conditions on the ground. Stalin was a great example of someone who saw no use in philosophy. As a personification of the *practico* party member, he was totally indiferrent to all questions of theory. 

This mood swept the Bolshevik faction, and Lenin found himself in a minority. Lenin, [[Krupskaya]], [[Zinoviev]], and [[Kamenev]] were compelled to emigrate to Switzerland to regroup. 

Lenin, always an optimist, was showing signs of strain. The Russian exile community in Switzerland was in dire straits. There was no money to go around, and most people had debilitating physical or mental issues due to the struggle. 

When Lenin & co. moved to Paris, the scene was even worse. Many in the exile community there were killing themselves or going insane. 

Even in Russia, the situation was dire. Bolshevik membership stood at 6,700 in 1907, but by 1910 there were a mere 506 remaining, without any unifying organizational structure to connect them. 

Lenin was somehow able to find the silver lining in this situation. Because of the flight of the petit bourgeois and intellectuals from the party, the leadership of party organizations was passing firmly into proletarian hands. 

During all this, networks of secret police were infiltrating every party organization. An agent of the Okhrana even became the head of the Moscow district organization. 

## The Pro-Party Mensheviks
The Mensheviks had their own problems. The liquidationists were posing more and more of a threat, and this was beginning to be realized by more and more rank-and-file Mensheviks. 

A new faction of Mensheviks emerged to face down the liquidationists. These 'Pro-Party' Mensheviks were led by Plekhanov, and gradually gravitated towards the Bolsheviks. 

The Bolsheviks began to negotiate a unification with this faction, and Lenin was careful to make sure that the pact with Plekhanov would last. 

This was Plekhanov's last true service to the workers' movement. He helped Lenin and the Bolsheviks fight off the otzovists to the left and the liquidators to the right. However, he proved unwilling to make a final break with the Menshevik mainstream. 

## Tensions in *Proletary*
The first task was to resolve the conflict with the otzovists. In June 1909, the enlarged board of *Proletary* met in Paris. This was a meeting of the center of Bolshevism, and it gave a space for all the debates that were brewing.

Bogdanov called for the Bolsheviks to split from the RSDLP. This totally undialectical desire for the independence of the revolutionary party is a hallmark of ultra-leftism. It ignores the need to connect with the masses. 

Fortunately, the meeting threw out the idea of a split with the RSDLP, and underlined the need for working with the pro-party Mensheviks. Soviet historians have reported that the Bogdanovites were expelled in this meeting, but that's false. The Bolsheviks marely proclaimed that they would not take responsibility for the actions of these people. 

The meeting also voted that all members of *Proletary*'s board should take a definitive stance towards dialectial materialism. 

After the meeting, Bogdanov showed no intention of following the decision on the split. He began to publish a factional leaflet, and was expelled as a result. The Bolsheviks' structure was shuddering under the weight of internal divisions, but remained more-or-less intact. 

The minority factions in the Bolsheviks- the Otzovists and the Bogdanovites- began to organize an offensive inside the organization. Unable to defeat Lenin in open debate, the Otzovites organized a factional school in Italy to recruit more supporters. The Bogdanovites began to publish a newspaper, *Vperyod*. 

Due to these squabbles, the workers were growing angry at the Vperyodists, and impatient with all factions for fighting about things the workers didn't care about. 

Lenin was totally inplacable about questions of principle, but had a lot of faith that those he disagreed with could change their positions. He applied this spirit well with the members of the factions whose ideas he ruthlessly critiqued. 

## Trotsky and Conciliationism
Trotsky thought that it was possible to unite the Bolsheviks with the left wing of the Mensheviks, and he wasn't alone. He hoped that the right wing of the Mensheviks could be thrown off, along with the ultraleft elements of the Bolsheviks. The only thing preventing Trotsky from joining the Bolsheviks at this point, whose ideas he agreed with generally, was what he saw as an attitude of 'factionalism.' 

Trotsky began to publish a paper called *Pravda* in 1908. It was sucessful because instead of talking only about other organizations on the left, which was a common theme, it talked about issues that the workers in Russia were facing, and tried to find common ground between organizations. This irritated Lenin, who viewed the factional struggle as one of utmost importance, and wanted Trotsky to come down firmly on his side. 

It was during this time that the biggest clashes between Lenin and Trotsky were to be found. Lenin even heatedly denounced [[Trotskyism]], but for him Trotskyism was Trotsky's position on the organizational question, and not much else. Lenin also used the idea of Trotskyism to direct fire on conciliationist tendencies in the Bolsheviks. 

In fact, Trotsky was close to beating Lenin in this battle for a long time. Many Bolshevik leaders agreed with Trotsky on the organizational question, which was actually the weakest part of his position. *Pravda* was motioned to become the official Bolshevik publication, against the wishes of Lenin. In the end, this didn't happen, but it shows how deep the conciliationist tendencies were in the Bolsheviks. 

As can be seen over and over, the mood of 'practical politics' was clouding the judgment of the conciliators. They viewed themselves as far more clever than those like Lenin, who seemed to be unable to look past theoretical questions and see the bigger picture of organizational work. In fact, the opposite situation was unfolding. It was only those like Lenin who were able to see past the immediate conditions and understand that the party needed to be preparing not for the present, but the future. 

In later years, Trotsky admitted that Lenin had been right all along on the organizational question, and said he had fallen victim to a kind of social-revolutionary fatalism about how the revolution would force the Mensheviks to take a revolutionary path. However, it would take the events of 1917 to show Trotsky the error of his ways. 

## The January Plenum
The horrible working conditions in Russia were a driving force behind those desiring unity. One attempt at this was the convention of a special Plenum designed to kick out the liquidators and otzovists, allowing for a reconciliation between the Bolsheviks and left-Mensheviks. 

Lenin was cynical about the prospects of such a reconciliation. He said that Trotsky was in a bloc with people "with whom he agrees on nothing theoretically but in everyrthing practically." He was against any unprincipled bloc in which there was no theoretical agreement. 

Lenin's protests were in vain, and the Plenum convened in January 1910. This was to be the last time the factions would meet and attempt to resolve their disputes. All the leaders were there except Plekhanov, who was sick. The abscence of the leader of the pro-party Mensheviks was a blow to Lenin in his efforts to rally the pro-party faction. 

Since there was no possibility of bridging the gaps, the outcome of the conference was unavoidable. For a move towards unity to work, there has to be actual theoretical agreement on at least the main issues. Otherwise, such an attempt is doomed to fail. 

The conference caused an immediate blow-up. The real issues relating to otzovism and liquidationism were postponed to a Party Conference at a later date. Lenin only agreed to this because he was assured that lots of workers in the illegal organizations would be able to attend. 

There was also a dispute about money. The Mensheviks caused a fuss about how the Bolsheviks still had access to funds raised through expropriation, and that a wealthy industrialist, Morozov, had left a large sum of money to the Bolsheviks after his nephew was killed by the Tsarist authorities during the reaction. 

The Bolsheviks made sacrifices for the sake of unity. They agreed to stop publishing *Proletary* and handed over their funds to a committee organized by the Socialist International. The main obstacle to unity was the Menshevik demands. They weren't prepared to expell the liquidationists, because that was a huge part of their organization. 

Finally, as a hollow gesture, Lenin and Plekhanov were elected as delegates to the upcoming Congress of the Socialist International. The real winners of the meeting were the Mensheviks, who didn't wind up their factional apparatus like the Bolsheviks did, and the money sent to the Socialist International would later be used for the German military effort in WW1. 

## 'Unity' Breaks Down
Lenin was skeptical of how long the unity could last, but was willing to go along with it. Right after the Plenum concluded, Lenin summoned a meeting of the Bolshevik faction. This showed that the same exact factions were operating just like before, and the Plenum solved nothing. 

The growth of the revolutionary movement led to sharpening of tensions between the factions. As the masses moved to the left, the Menshevik liquidators moved to the right. In every way, the Bolsheviks were worse off than they had been before the Plenum. 

Luckily, the Bolsheviks could rely on what was happenin at the grass-roots level of their organization to make up for the higher level issues. The pro-party Mensheviks throughout Russia were working with the Bolsheviks more and more. Another benefit of the Plenum was that it opened Lenin's mind to the idea of [[opportunism]] as an international phenomenon. He had always considered himself an orthodox Kautskyite, but had seen that Kautsky had played a negative, vaccilating role at the Plenum, and wondered if Kautsky was so cool after all. 

Lenin's tone in this period is very sharp. He was in the minority in the Bolsheviks, but he clearly saw that the Mensheviks were dead weight on the revolutionary movement. The rest of the party would figure this out a little over two years later.

## On the Eve
The saying goes that it's always darkest just before the dawn. While this is false astronomically, it was true for the forces of the RSDLP. The party, and especially Lenin's faction, were in a hopeless position. They were barely able to maintain regular meetings in the Russian cities, much less have a real fighting organization. 

When the workers began to move left once more, they naturally gravitated towards the familiar banner of the RSDLP. This breathed new life into the organizations. This vindicated Lenin's opposition to splitting from the larger party, which would have isolated the Bolsheviks. 

# Part Four: The Revival
## A Brief Interregnum
Lenin established a party school to teach Bolsheviks theory. This was to act as a counterweight to the other party schools, which were controlled by Bogdanov's allies. Unbeknownst to the Bolsheviks, a Tsarist police spy also attended, taking meticulous notes. 

Lenin's goals with this school were to establish a defined Bolshevik tendency. While there were non-Bolshevik instructors at the school, there were no liquidationists. 

Lenin was happy that, in general, the RSDLP was purging its liquidationist and otzovist elements. But there were still opposing forces in the party, which were rowing in opposite directions. 

The divisions in the RSDLP came roaring back. At a meeting of the CC in Paris, the Mensheviks stormed out and refused to acknowledge the validity of the gathering. Bolsheviks and Mensheviks would never work together in the same organ of the RSDLP. 

Lenin understood the need for a decisive break with the Mensheviks. The Pro-Party wing of the Mensheviks had already largely gone over to the Bolsheviks at the rank-and-file level, and the remaining Mensheviks were trending rightward. 

## Mass Work Under Conditions of Reaction
The [[unions]] were an important site of struggle. The Mensheviks said that the unions should be politically neutral, and should only agitate for economic demands. In this way, they echoed the economists. 

The Bolshevik position was that while unions should include as wide a swath of the working class as possible, the Marxists should still fight passionately within the unions to win a majority, and bring the unions into the political struggle. [[Martov]] opposed this on the grounds that it wasn't right for "Russian conditions" for the Marxists to seek union leadership. 

The Mensheviks would maintain their domination of the trade unions right up until 1917, but the Bolsheviks made steady gains in their work among the unions and among other workers' organizations such as clubs and insurance societies. 

The Bolsheviks would intervene in any forum that had *any* possibility of strengthening their links with the masses. From anti-alcoholism conferences to meetings of doctors or university faculties, the Bolsheviks would advance resolutions calling for the restructuring of society along working class lines. 

However, this was still in the context of a depressed and sleepy working class. But by 1910, things were beginning to turn around.

## The Prague Conference
Lenin was convinced of a need to decisively break with the Mensheviks. He pushed hard for a new conference for the RSDLP, which was held in January 1912. The attendees were mostly Bolsheviks. 

There wasn't total unity within the Bolsheviks either. Lenin didn't want any liquidators to be invited, but they were. 

This conference marked the beginning of an independent Bolshevik party. 

## The Provocateur Malinovsky
Despite taking precautions, there were agents of the secret police at the Prague Conference. Luckily, the identities of the new Central Committee members were still unknown to them, since everyone wrote their chosen candidate down and handed the slips to Lenin, who didn't publicly announce the elected slate to the CC. 

The agents of the Tsarist state were quite good at getting their agents into key positions in the RSDLP and its associated groups on the Russian left. One of these agents was Roman Malinovsky. 

He was once a genune member of the movement, and was the president of the St. Petersburg Metal Workers' Union at one point. However, in 1910 he became a police spy. He even became one of the Bolshevik candidates for the Duma before he was caught. He was eventually executed after the October Revolution. 

Despite all the efforts at repression, the Tsarist state was simply brushed away by the working class when the time came. This demonstrates that the power of the state is nothing but a paper tiger once the workers wake up to reality and accept their revolutionary task. 

The integrity of the Bolsheviks also blunted the effect of the agents. By being so disciplined, even the numerous spies were compelled to do the daily work of the organization in order to stay in their cover. 

## After the Conference
The Mensheviks organized their own conference too, confirming the split. Trotsky was still on the warpath in his attempt to unify the party, but he was spending all his time talking to 'allies' that he had absolutely nothing in common with anymore. 

This bloc of anti-Bolsheviks eventually disintegrated into its component factions, because they had nothing in common besides their hatered of Lenin. 

## A New Awakening
Out of nowhere in 1912, there was a *huge* clash at a protest in the Lena gold mine in Siberia. The miners went on strike over wages and conditions, led by a Bolshevik. The state sent in the army, who shot into the crowd, killing 270 and wounding 250 more. 

This massacre electrified the country. Within weeks, there were hundereds of thousands of workers on strike throughout the cities. The slogan right from the start was "Down with the tsarist government!"

The Bolsheviks found themselves as the decisive force. They began to direct the workers and issue slogans through all their legal avenues of publication. Lenin moved from Paris to Krakow, in order to be closer to the action. 

## Lenin and *Pravda*
The party began to make strides in growth. By 1913 there were 22 workers' cells in Moscow alone, and the Party was able to get things done much more efficiently without the influence of the Mensheviks or Liquidators. 

However, the growth came with challenges. The need was evident for a Bolshevik daily paper to counter bourgeois sources. They called it *Pravda,* totally stealing Trotsky's paper name (lol). 

Lenin insisted on using the paper for talking about factional disagreements, to the frustration of others on the editorial board. 

> It is harmful, destructive, ridiculous to conceal differences from the workers (as _Pravda_ is doing)… If you remain silent, you have abstained. And a paper which abstains, has perished. (V.I. Lenin, _Collected Works_, in Russian, vol. 48, p. 71.)

## Elections to the Fourth Duma
On the eve of the 1912 Duma elections, the Mensheviks had a lot of advantages. They had lots of money from well-off supporters, and had even more money from the SPD. They had a daily legal paper that called for unity and non-factional candidates to be run in the RSDLP ticket. 

The Cadets and Mensheviks called for unity, while the Bolsheviks argued about whether that was correct, or if they should just run Bolshevik candidates instead. 

They ended up running Bolshevik candidates in safe districts where there was no chance of Black Hundreds candidates being elected. 

The Bolsheviks ended up doing great, even though the deck was stacked against them in many ways. 

## Bolsheviks in the Duma
While the Bolshevik fraction in the Duma represented about 80% of the workers, there were just as many Mensheviks as Bolsheviks, and the more experienced Mensheviks were able to dominate the Bolsheviks at first, because the latter had never been in that kind of environment. They were mainly steel workers before they were elected. 

The Mensheviks strove to free the RSDLP Duma fraction from the will of the party. Under immense pressure by the Bolsheviks, the Bolshevik representatives began to distance themselves from the Mensheviks in the Duma. 

Since there was little room for agitation in Russia at the time, the work in the Duma was important. The Bolshevik reps were able to raise all sorts of important issues, above all the land question. This provided a wide scope for developing agitation and propaganda. 

As always, legal work was combined with illegal work. The deputies in the Duma would go right up to the line of legality in terms of what they called for, and then the underground Bolshevik papers would supplement their words. 

The Social Democrats in the Duma allied with the representatives of the progressive layers of the petty bourgeois peasantry, the Trudoviks. This allowed them to gain the ear of the peasantry in a new way. 

The Bolshevik deputies also did extensive work outside the Duma, visiting factories and giving speeches to workers. 

## Tactics in the Duma
The overarching goal of the Bolshevik deputies was to expose the inner workings of the state. However, they often found themselves in sticky situations when the liberals would put forward reform bills that would fail without Bolshevik support. Is it permissible to vote with the liberals?

To vote against every liberal proposal would be to turn the Bolsheviks into a sect. The deputies would support parts of bills that would lead to genuine improvements for the workers, but vote against them if the improvements were not noticeable. 

## Revolutionary Upswing
The Duma elections took place amid a revolutionary surge. Workers were striking more an more in 1912 and 1913. Bolsheviks were often playing a leading role in these strikes. 

The Bolsheviks were testing their political line on the masses, and were getting a very positive response. The Party was also putting forward a serious effort to control the Duma deputies, who tended to be concilliatory towards the Mensheviks, even as the split was widening and deepening. 

## 'The Masses Have Now Grown Up'
It was unclear how many Bolsheviks there were in 1913, but Lenin estimated the number to be 30-50 thousand. However, the influence of the Bolsheviks was growing far faster than their formal membership. 

In light of these conditions, where workers' organizations were spontaneously springing up without any formal Bolshevik integration, Lenin moved to consider any regular reader of *Pravda* as a member. This demonstrates his flexibility when it came to matters of tactics. The situation had changed. The Bolsheviks were moving from a small, embryonic party of cadre to a mass workers' party. 

## Split in the Duma Group
The Bolsheviks in the Duma were still stalling when it came to declaring a clean break with the Menshevik deputies. Lenin was very critical of this. The Mensheviks sensed their support among the workers drying up and turned to the Socialist International to try and retain control. 

Even during the revolutionary upswing, the Bolsheviks never ceased to agitate for small reforms and the demands of the workers, as a means of welding their party ever closer to the proletariat. 

This invalidates the narriative of reformists vs revolutionary Marxists. Revolutionary Marxists are actually the most dedicated to reforms, while reformists tend to easily move from reform to counter-reform once in power, under the pressure of the capitalists. 

## The National Question
The national question was of decisive importance in Russia, where 57% of the population were marginalized nationalities who suffered greatly at the hands of the 43% who were of Russian ethnicity. Additionally, anti-Semitism was rampant. 

These divisions in the working class were taken full advantage of by the Tsarist state. 

The Bolsheviks recognized that the only way to fight against racism and anti-Semitism was through teaching the workers that such divisions were being used against them, and to advocate unity of the class against its' true enemies. Of course, this also assumed that action would be taken to protect minorities from attack. 

In this way, the Bolsheviks were able to cut across all differences of nationality, race, and [[religion]], weakening these tools in the hands of the state. 

This was totally different from the approach taken by the Bund, who wanted to split the workers along national and religious lines. They demanded to act as the sole representative of the Jewish people, a tactic that in effect isolated the Jews from the rest of the movement. 

## Lenin on the National Question
Lenin said that "The slogan of workers' democracy is not 'national culture' but the international culture of democracy and the working-class movement." He was opposed to the elevation of any national culture, including any special privledges in terms of language. 

Lenin also recognized that the 'national cultures' of even marginalized and oppressed groups were the cultures of the bourgeoisies of those groups. 

Lenin was firmly against the setting up of seperate schools, groups, or organizations for the different nationalities and minorities. 

Instead, Lenin advociated for the *right* to self-determination. However, he didn't think that Marxists should always support seperatism. In fact, he said that "For a Marxist, of course, _all other conditions being equal_, big states are always preferable to small ones."

As a Marxist, Lenin viewed the nation-state as an obsolete institution that hampers the unity of the working class and holds back society. However, in reference to the quote above, *all else is not equal.* 

Marxists must support the cause of all oppressed minorities, and must take up a working class position on all matters of oppression. This position must put the class struggle to the forefront. 

This is why Lenin made such a big deal about including the rights of nations to self-determination in the Bolshevik platform. He wanted to ensure that the Bolsheviks were seen as an ally to oppressed groups, and that the Bolsheviks (who were mainly of Russian ethnicity) were known to have no interest in keeping the other nationalities in chains. 

He hoped that after the revolution these nationalities would see that the Russian working class had no interest in exploiting them and would choose to remain united. 

> If a Ukrainian Marxist allows himself to be swayed by his _quite legitimate and natural_ hatred of the Great-Russian oppressors to _such a degree_ that he transfers even a particle of this hatred, even if it be only estrangement, to the proletarian culture and proletarian cause of the Great-Russian workers, then such a Marxist will get bogged down in bourgeois nationalism. Similarly, the Great-Russian Marxist will be bogged down, not only in bourgeois, but also in Black-Hundred nationalism, if he loses sight, even for a moment, of the demand for complete equality for the Ukrainians, or of their _right_ to form an independent state. (Ibid., p. 33.)

Lenin and the Bolsheviks opposed nationalism of the oppressor, and also the nationalism of the oppressed, when it came to the mood among the working class. 

## The Balkan Wars
The national question is really tricky since it can seem totally progressive on the surface for marginalized communities to seek liberation for their nation. However, reactionary interests can lurk behind it. 

Indeed, even the Tsarist state tried to use the rhetoric of national liberation for the Slavs to gain a foothold in the Balkans. 

This is why Lenin always insisted that the question of class come first, before the national question. He also emphasized that the position Marxists should take on individual nationalist movements is dependent on lots of factors unique to each situation. 

Lenin's position can be seen in light of the Balkan Wars. He didn't take sides in a conflict in which each side claimed that it was the victim and that its right to self determination was being violated. 

> Never and in no place has 'freedom' been won by the oppressed peoples by means of war of one people against another... Real freedom of the Slav peasants of the Balkans, and also of the Turkish peasant can be won only by complete freedom within each country... (V.I. Lenin, _Collected Works_, in Russian, vol. 22, pp. 151-52.)

The Balkans Wars were caused by the intensifying contradictions among the great powers of Europe. The Ottoman Empire was slowly dying, and the Balkan nations seized the opportunity to free themselves of Turkish rule. As Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria won their freedom, they were immediatley turned into the puppets of various European powers, like Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia. 

The Tsar was attempting to use a cynical banner of pan-Slavism to ally the various nations in the Balkans against Turkey, because Russia really wanted access to the warm-water port of Constantinople. 

Within Russia, the hypocricy of the liberals was exposed by how readily they supported the Tsar in this mission. The Cadets condemned the government for *not* going to war over the Balkans, saying that the Tsar was betraying the Slavs in the region. Behind the profesed love for the Slavs stood the interests of the Russian bourgeoisie who saw profit in the taking of more territory. 

The Ottoman Empire was defeated in 1913. The yoke of repression was lifted from the various nations, only to be immediately replaced by the yoke of capitalist oppression and subjugation by the great powers of Europe. The newly independent countries immediately started attacking each other. 

This shows the need for a dialectical approach to national oppression. The oppressed nations immediately became oppressor nations upon their liberation. 

The position of Lenin, Trotsky, and other authentic Marxists was that the only way to secure the end to oppression would be for a united working class revolution in the Balkans, leading to the establishment of a federated workers' state across the region. 

## The Gathering Storm
After the Balkan Wars, the Social Democrats knew a world war was on the horizon. Thinkers like Lenin and Luxemburg took the position that the only way to avoid one was the revolutionary movement of the working class. 

On the surface, the international socialist movement appeared very strong. In 1914, the Second Internation had 41 parties with a total membership of 12 million. 

In the Second International, pacifism was the predominant trend. All the leaders of the various parties claimed that they would never support war, and even unanimously approved Lenin's amendment stating that if a war broke out, the proletariat would use the opportunity to overthrow capitalism. This was pure smoke and mirrors on their part, they had no intention of doing anything like that. 

In Russia, Lenin and the Bolsheviks always approached their anti-war agitation from a class perspective. Instead of the whimpering pacifist line, they formed an agressive, 'no war but class war' position. 

## The Bolsheviks' Influence Grows
In 1913, one strike wave followed another. Russia was plunging into another revolutionary period. The Bolsheviks were growing quickly throughout this period. 

The party apparatus in St. Petersburg functioned through party nuclei in each factory or workshop, which elected (in secret) executive committees to manage their affairs. Such committees reported to the Petersburg Committee. 

*Pravda* was the main weapon for spreading Bolshevik influence. Its circulation grew to 40,000 a day, whereas the Menshevik paper was selling only 16,000. 

The work among women workers was also substantial. Lenin attached great importance to this question. 

The work among the trade unions was a big question for the Bolsheviks. The Mensheviks had traditionally relied on the unions for their base. Despite this, and the fact that the unions represented only a small fraction of the total working class, the Bolsheviks still engaged in patient work within the unions to win over the workers there. 

The work of the Bolsheviks finally paid off in 1914, when the Bolsheviks had won majorities in the Moscow and St. Petersburg unions. The Mensheviks had totally lost connection with the working class in their quest to gain allies in the liberal bourgeoisie. 

## The Bolsheviks on the Eve of the War
As the earth quaked under the Tsarist state, the liberals tried to use the chaos to push for reforms. Their battle cry was "reforms before it's too late!" Cracks began to show at the upper levels of the state. Decision-makers began to vaccilate between granting reforms and repressing protests. 

The liberals and Mensheviks created an opposition committee, and invited the Bolsheviks. Lenin decided to agree, just to see if they could get any money out of the spineless liberals before they inevitable broke down under the pressure of the reactionaries who now controlled the state. 

Even while the Bolsheviks grew and grew, Lenin worried about consolidation and the state of the CC and the editorial board of *Pravda.* He saw the need for fresh blood in both organs. 

Meanwhile, the Mensheviks were desperatley calling for unity, despite the fact that the Bolsheviks had achieved unity of the working class under their banner alone. The Mensheviks called on the Socialist International to act as a mediator, and because of the high standing of the SI in the eyes of the workers, Lenin agreed to the meeting. 

The meeting was a total joke. The Social Democrats tried to enforce unity through bureaucratic means, where no real unity existed on the basic questions. 

Russia's position in the world economy, with the national bourgeoisie weak and dependent on foreign [[capital]], made it inevitable that Russian foreign policy would lead towards war. There was a desperate need for expansion, and Russia was sucked into an alliance with Britain and [[France]] in search of conquest. 

The Russian workers movement was stronger than it had been, even in 1905. The workers consciousness was on a much higher level, as evidenced by the majorities the Bolsheviks had achieved among the workers seats in the Duma and in the union leaderships. By multiple metrics, the Bolsheviks could count at least 75% of the workers among their supporters. 

The Bolshevik CC called a three-day general strike to test their strength. The strike grew to over 130,000 workers. 

The state struck back against this growing threat. *Pravda* was closed by the police. Bolshevik organizers were arrested everywhere, as union headquarters and workers clubs were raided. 

While the movement was heightened in the major cities, it was less intense than it had been in 1905 when it came to the outlying areas of Russia. This demonstrated that there was a wide gap between the proletariat and the peasantry. 

There were many among the Bolsheviks who wanted to push confrontation, knowing that they would likely be able to topple the government. However, Lenin urged caution, believing that the attitudes of the peasantry would be decisive when it came to the ineveitable counter-attack by the Russian army. 

In the middle of all this, historical events cut across the action. On July 18th, 1914, [[WW1]] began.

# The War Years
## The Collapse of the Second International
Shamefully, the German, French, British, and Austrian parties of the Second International immediatley abandoned the workers movement to ally with their sections of the bourgeoisie. Their left [[reformism]] was shown to be a total sham. Despite their radical phrases, they were fundamentally on the side of the bourgeoisie and class society.

These parties began to call on the workers to defend their countries, and not strike for the duration of the war. In France, the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]] had been calling for a general strike to prevent war. This was an adventuristic notion, because it is on the eve of war that the state feels itself to be the strongest, and the population is the most likely to go along with what the state says. The truth of this was realized when the day after the war began, these anarchists dropped their demand for a general strike and began to play ball with the ruling coalition. 

With the help of the Social Democratic leadership, the ruling classes of Europe were able to mislead and intoxicate significant portions of their working classes when it came to the war. 

## The Social Roots of Chauvinism
Such a situation couldn't possibly be explained by individual betrayal alone. Because the major Social Democratic parties in Europe, notably the German one, had developed during a long upswing in capitalism, they had developed a politics of "class peace." With climbing living standards and full employment, this was a natural development. 

This led to a tendency of the labor leaders to become separate from the working class. Through privledge and association with the representatives of the bourgeoisie, they succumbed to alien class influences. The theoretical expression of this trend was the rise of revisionism in terms of Marx and Engels' ideas. 

In addition to the right-wing leaders in these parties, we have the centrists. People like [[Kautsky]], who vacillated between opportunism and a proletarian perspective. The theoretical expression of this uncertainty was toothless pacifism. Lenin directed his fire at these people most of all, calling them "left in words, right in deeds." 

Of course, the authentic Marxist leaders which could still be found in these parties didn't go down without a fight. People like [[Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and [[Connolly]] in Ireland split with the social chauvinists. They began to organize their supporters to oppose the war. 

However, the forces of revolution tended to be very weak, and often [[ultraleftism]] prevailed as a reaction to the [[opportunism]] of the mainstream. 

## Tendencies in Russian Social Democracy
The only good thing about war is that it pitilessly tears apart weak programs and exposes all the lies in politics and society. The total hypocrisy of people like [[Peter Kropotkin]] were exposed as they rallied around the Tsar's state. Tragically, the once revolutionary [[Plekhanov]] became an ultra-nationalist, and was isolated even among the right wing in the Mensheviks becuase of how rabid he was.

Russia had similar phenomenae at play as did Europe - with one crucial difference. The revolutionary current was much stronger due to the work that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had perservered in for decades. Lenin was especially to thank for putting a quick end to the confusion and vacillations that even the Bolsheviks underwent at the start of the war. 

However the Bolsheviks were in a far better internal position than the Mensheviks. Due to their unpreparedness, they immediatley fractured into multiple factions as they debated the war question. 

Lenin was astonished by the turn Plekhanov had taken, but was more concerned with the chauvinists-in-disguise who sounded revolutionary and could trick the workers more easily. Most Mensheviks were closer to Kautsky's centrism than to Plekhanov's insanity. Due to the pressure of the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks actually stood to the left of most of the Socialist International. 

The voice of the left current in the Mensheviks was [[Martov]]. He opposed the war outright, and actually opposed forming a block with the liberals, which was unusual for a Menshevik. Lenin even wondered if he was moving towards Bolshevism. But he stopped halfway, as Martov was oft to do. 

Trotsky, for his part, took up a staunch internationalist stance. He still wasn't a member of any faction. His main contribution was publishing a daily paper from France, which no other Marxist was able to get done during this time. 

As usual, the only question separating Trotsky and Lenin during this time was that of party unity. Trotsky considered it more important than ever to unite all the internationalists of the movement. This meant he was pushing harder than ever to get the left-Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks onto the same team. 

## Lenin's Position
Lenin stood on the far left, even in the Bolsheviks. Many Bolsheviks even thought he was taking an ultraleft stance on war. Lenin was taken by surprise by the actions of the Socialist International. Once he realized his mistaken view of them, he was in favor of a break - as quickly and decisively as possible. He wanted to create as much distance between the revolutionary and reformist currents as he could, and begin to win the working class to their position.

However, the work was in a bad state. The forces of revolutionary internationalism were mainly confined to consolidating cadre, and were isolated from the masses. 

Lenin's desire to break completely with the whole International was a hard pill to swallow, and it took a lot of convincing to get the rest of the Bolsheviks to go along with it. However, Lenin never backed down from the historical task that he faced:

> This is an international task. It devolves on us, there is no one else. We must not retreat from it. It is wrong to put forward the watchword of the ‘simple’ restoration of the International... The watchword of ‘peace’ is wrong: the watchword should be transformation of the national war into a civil war.

Lenin's style was always polemical. He sought to drive home his point so deep, so concretely, that it would shatter the audience's preconceptions. He would even go to the point of exaggeration, as he did when he claimed that the workers could only develop a "trade union consciousness" without a vanguard party. In the same way, a slogan of "turn the war into a civil war" wouldn't have been able to find an echo among the masses. It's a bit ultraleft, but Lenin's purpose was to overcorrect a little bit so that the Bolsheviks would stiffen up on the war question, where they were starting to wobble a little bit. 

Fundamentally, Lenin was writing for the cadres, *not for the masses* when he said these sorts of things. We have to understand this or else we risk veering in an ultraleftist direction. This is complicated by the fact that Lenin's positions were often oversimplified by his own supporters, who would claim that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were in favor of a Russian defeat, since that would hasten revolution. This claim was true, but to go in front of the masses and support the victory of Germany would have been suicidal. 

## The Mood of the Working Class
The art of creating a revolutionary party consists in connecting the finished program of Marxism with the unfinished, confused, and contradictory mood of the working class. In this case, this meant steeling the cadre against chauvinism while at the same time emphasizing that the Bolsheviks were ready to fight against the German imperialists, just not to fight *for* the Russian state. 

While the majority of the working class opposed the war and held an internationalist attitude, there were enough petty bourgeois and peasant supporters that the development of a protest movement against the war was impossible. 

As for the army, the composition was overwhelmingly peasant. The Bolsheviks who had been drafted found themselves islands in a sea of political backwardness. 

## The Party Decimated
This was an extremely isolating time for the Bolsheviks. They lost their ability to run Party organizations, and even to communicate back and forth. Waves of arrests decimated their organization, and the backward layers of the workers acted as a bucket of water on the sparks that were building in the factories. 

In exile in Switzerland, Lenin was unable to even communicate with anyone in Russia to see what was going on. 

## The Duma Fraction
The Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Trudoviks in the Duma were under immense pressure to support the war. The Trudoviks caved immediately, since their peasant base was generally supportive of the war. 

As for the Bolsheviks, they vaccilated on their initially anti-war stance. Feeling isolated, they moved closer to the Mensheviks, to Lenin's dismay. 

However, the fraction soon regained its footing, and came out against the war. Their speeches at factories and rallies were the highlight of the work the Bolsheviks were doing for a time. 

Unfortunately, the entire Boshevik Duma group were arrested after attending a small meeting with the regional leadership. This was a major blow for the Party, especially since the lack of mass protests in response indicated the true situation among the working class.

## Vacillations Among the Bolsheviks
The Bolsheviks weren't immune to the rightward-shifting mood. Some Bolsheviks in exile in France even volunteered for the French army! However, this was an extreme case. More often, the drifting was towards [[pacifism]]. 

Lenin criticized the slogans of "Long live peace" and "Down with the war," preferring instead calls for class war and a peoples' militia. 

However, Lenin was kind of on his own in his views. Other leading Bolsheviks like [[Kamenev]] really didn't agree with how [[Lenin advocated revolutionary defeatism]]. 

## The 'Left' Bolsheviks
If Kamenev represented the drift towards [[opportunism]], then [[Bukharin]] represented the tendency towards [[ultraleftism]], especially on the national question, which was very important to be clear on during wartime, where annexations might happen. 

Bukharin and those like him believed that since the world was now in the epoch of [[imperialism]], there was no need to advocate for 'democratic' demands (the demands made by a bourgeois revolution), including the right of nations to self determination. 

Lenin finally decided to call a Congress of the groups of Bolsheviks spread across Europe in exile. There was argument about the war question, but they decided to agree with Lenin's position unanimously. 

## Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism
Lenin now set out on a large project studying imperialism. He did so in response to new ideas about the automatic collapse of capitalism, coming from [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and the idea that imperialism could lead to a globally planned economy on the basis of finance [[capital]]. 

This was during a period of deep setbacks among the working class in terms of class consciousness. The most advanced workers tended to be sent to the front, and the replacements came from the more backwards layers. This expressed itself in the far fewer strikes that happened during this period. 

## The Trial of Bolshevik Duma Deputies
Lenin thought that the trial would be a great place to publicly show the strength and courage of the Bolsheviks. However, the performance of the Duma deputies (and Kamenev, who was arrested about the same time) was uneven. Some didn't even admit to being Bolsheviks, and Kamenev denied being against the war in general. Nevertheless, they were all exiled to Siberia for life, and this did raise the reputation of the Bolsheviks in the eyes of the workers, who saw that the deputies were going to prison for their principles. 

In 1915, the underground work started to bottom out and make a bit of a comeback. The factory cells increased in number and membership for the first time, but they were still filled by inexperienced comrades who were new to the struggle. 

These cells had to operate in utmost secrecy, and elections were generally not possible. In general, leadership was determined by co-option onto regional committees in secret. 

## Closed Frontiers
The work in exile was extremely slow. It was really hard to get any literature into Russia, and trustworthy people were hard to come by. Lenin could only really rely on [[Krupskaya]] and was asking his two sisters to carry contraband. 

Bukharin was being ultraleft again, and started publishing his own paper, *Kommunist.* 

## German Intrigues
The Great Powers attempted to inspire domestic revolt in their enemies. The ex-revolutionary Parvus was working with Germany to try and ensnare revolutionaries into collaboration. 

The German general staff offered funding and support to the Bolsheviks, but Lenin refused. Much effort by enemies of the revolution has been made to make Lenin into a German agent, but this is simply false. While Lenin sought to play the great powers against one another, he clearly saw the danger in falling into a web of intrigue. 

## How Did the Party Survive?
The party was in terrible shape at the start of the war. Stalinist historians have tried to paint a rosy picture of this time period, but it was really quite rough. There was little actual organizational structure between the small and isolated factory cells that still existed. 

However, the iron core of cadre at the center of the Bolsheviks meant that they were doing better than the Mensheviks, who had basically disappeared. Also, the fact remained that four fifths of the workers supported the Bolsheviks. This fact is what allowed the Bolsheviks to be nearly destroyed and pushed into the shadows, and yet surge back with a vengance when conditions changed. 

## Catastrophe at the Front
The war was going really badly. The only thing going for the Russian Army was the number of troops it had. It didn't have enough equipment to supply them. By the end of 1914, Russia had taken over 1.8 million casualties against the Germans with little progress to show for it. 

The working class was generally not patriotic, and even the patriotic peasants weren't patriotic anymore after seeing such carnage for a war which they didn't understand. The Army composed a microcosm of Russian society. Those in the trenches suffered, while those who gave orders made huge mistakes and shrugged off the thousands of lives they threw away. 

Most army mutinies are lead by NCOs. These soldiers are selected from the most intelligent and energetic layers of the conscripted soldiers. Their experiences running the actual day-to-day operations tends to breed a disdain for the upper echelons, whose depravity and foolishness these officers see first hand. 

In four months, the Russian Army was forced to retreat 300 miles, ceding a territory larger than France. By this point, between 7.2 and 8.5 million Russians had been either killed or wounded, *amounting to 45-53% of the entire Army.*

## Bolsheviks in the Armed Forces
The Bolsheviks never had a policy of refusing to serve in the army. They preferred to go where the working class was going, to work alongside them and spread Marxism. However, the peasant dominated army was a difficult place to work. Bolsheviks found better luck in the Russian navy, which had more of a working class composition. 

While we can't know how many Bolsheviks were working among the navy, we can see reverberations of strike movements echoing through the Baltic fleet, evidence of the growing radicalization of the sailors. This radicalization was certainly egged on by the Bolshevik agitators, but appeared to grow mainly due to the horrible conditions that the sailors faced.

Cells would spontaneously appear aboard ship after ship, and they would try and get in touch with the central apparatus of the Bolsheviks, who they viewed as genuine leaders of their class. 

The leadership of these Social Democratic cells tried to prevent violent outbursts from the sailors, but were sometimes unable. These outbursts led to severe repression and executions of those involved. 

## The Liberals Begin to Stir
Seeing the weakness of the regime, the liberals began to pressure the Tsar to reconvene the Duma, which he did in 1915. The liberals entered a coalition with the Nationalists, calling for a change to the execution of the war. In their weakness, the Mensheviks and Trudoviks supported this bloc. 

The Tsar had no intention of allowing the Liberals any more power in the government, but played along with reforms for now. Meanwhile, he was reaching out to Germany to begin negotiations. 

Later that year, the Tsar dissolved the Duma for a few months. Oh well, nice try liberals.  The workers struck in response to this, but their slogan was "down with the government," not "reconvene the Duma." This demonstrated to the liberals that there was no way to make a deal with the Crown, and the only way forward was a social revolution, which they were more afraid of than anything. Fundamentally, the liberals were terrified that the Tsar seemed totally unwilling to do anything to save himself from the rage of the masses. 

## The Turn of the Tide
Gradually, contacts between sections of the Party were strengthening. Strikes became more intense, with clashes between workers and soldiers leaving hundreds dead. The proletariat was awakening once more. 

The bourgeoisie set up war industry committees with the goal of making the war industry more efficient, and channeling some working class anger towards a 'productive' outlet. The Mensheviks and SRs supported participating, while the Bolsheviks didn't, viewing these organizations as bourgeois institutions, set up to aid in the imperialist war effort. However, they did use the elections to these committees as tools for agitation. 

In the first round of elections, the Bolshevik deputies won a majority on the committees. Furious, the bourgeois organizers demanded another round of elections, which the Mensheviks and SRs cynically went along with. The second round was marked by police oppression on all levels. The authorities were determined not to let the Bolsheviks win. In response, the Bolsheviks denounced the committees and walked out of the factory meetings. The boycott that the Bolsheviks called for worked, and most large factories ended up not electing anyone to the committees, which eventually sputtered out. 

Due to the intense conditions, the Bolsheviks began trying to find allies on the Russian left. They approached various non-aligned groups to form a front with them. They retained freedom of criticism at all times, which was very important. 

## Crisis of Tsarism
Due to the many interlinked factors facing the regime, a massive wave of discontent was brewing. An unprecedented number of strikes - both economic and political in their demands - gripped the country in 1915 and 1916. The army began to have small mutinies, and the peasants began to stir as well. The army began to take the side of the workers when sent to disperse protests, and even the Cossacks refused to fire on the demonstrators in a few cases. 

Raputin was almost a comic personification of the corruption at the heart of the regime. A section of the aristocracy had him killed, hoping to stave off imminent disaster. They also wanted to place the Tsarina in a mental institution, idealistically thinking that by removing the sources of bad advice, the Tsar would be transformed into a competent ruler! 

The crisis never ceased to intensify. The huge debts of the regime compelled it to begin printing money, causing dramatic inflation. The cost of a pair of boots went up 334% in a few years. On the eve of the February revolution, the average working woman in Petrograd spent 40 hours per week waiting in line for rations. 

## Change of Mood
As the mood was changing in Russia, this inevitably seeped into the revolutionary organizations. The Party at this point had virtually no central organization, and the scattered cells were hanging on for dear life, with no money to speak of and few real organizers. 

The Party was able to take advantage of the upswing in the consciousness of the workers, publishing millions of leaflets against all odds. They worked wherever they could, seeing as most unions and workers organizations were illegal at this time. 

## Work Among Women
Women in Russia had been drawn more and more into the workforce as the war effort sucked up more and more men. The Bolsheviks adressed these women, tying their unique struggle to the struggle for liberation generally. 

These women were learning a horrible lesson about the world very quickly. Their husbands, either serving at the front or dead. They were drafted themselves into the factories, where the conditions were horrible. They weren't paid enough to feed their children, and soon came to occupy the front lines in the class struggle. 

The Party began to publish a newspaper for women, called *Rabotnitsa* (*Woman Worker*). 

## Pacifist Gestures
*Rabotnitsa* called for an international conference of socialist women, and they got a big echo. The Social Democrats in Germany and Austria also began planning a conference. 

Unfortunately, the main current at this conference was that of toothless pacifism. 

## The Zimmerwald Conference
Lenin was always trying to get another international going. All Bolsheviks living abroad were supposed to set up internationalist clubs to connect with local socialists. There had been attempts here and there after 1914, but they were always polluted by pacifism and an unwillingness to really break with the German Social Democrats. 

The Zimmerwald Conference was held in September 1915 in Switzerland. This was one of the first real meetings of the antiwar socialists in a long time. Even at this meeting, Lenin was in the minority. The truly internationalist wing was only 8 out of 38 delegates. 

Despite the shortcomings of the Zimmerwald Left, as it became known, the newfound spirit of international connection was useful. Things began to move across Europe, as antiwar sections saw that there were potential allies out there. 

## The Kienthal Conference
The old International, which had basically been in a coma since the war started, came to life again. Another conference was called. The left was stronger here than at Zimmerwald, but the mood of the majority was still vaccilating and centrist. 

The bloc that the Party had temporarily made with some centrist elements was bound to burst eventually. During wartime, all vaccilation is going to disappear eventually. Lenin just helped speed this up by forcing clarification. 

Above all else, Lenin hated those who were revolutionary in words, but reformist in action. Many centrists were like that. 

In January 1917, Lenin gave a speech in Switzerland, saying "We of the older generation may not live to see the decisive battles of this coming revolution." One month later, the Tsar would be overthrown. One year later, the Bolsheviks would be in power. 

# The Year of Revolution
## The February Revolution
1917 was ushered in by the largest strike wave that Russia had ever seen. The mood of the masses had reached a boiling point. Each strike wave now seemed like a dress rehersal for revolution, with mass meetings and calls for the overthrow of the Tsar. 

On February 22nd, the Putilov arms plant locked out 30,000 workers who were demanding higher wages. This was a huge mistake, as it sent all of them into the streets, where they linked up with the thousands of women waiting in bread lines. 

The next day was International Womens' Day. 200,000 workers went on strike in Petrograd, more than half of the working class in total. The tide was simply too strong to hold back. Massive crowds simply swept the police and soldiers away as they marched towards the city center. 

Agitators and orators appeared on every corner. Many were Bolsheviks, but many were ordinary workers who, for the first time in their lives, refused to stay quiet. 

On Feb 25th, around 30 workers leaders met in Petrograd to set up a soviet. Although about half were arrested the same day, the soviet was established. This prompted the Tsar to order the forces of reaction to clamp down. 

The police opened fire into the crowds that were everywhere in the city, but even this wasn't enough to disperse the crowds for more than a few minutes. 

Even now, the Bolsheviks didn't truly realize what was happening. Party organizers thought that the situation would disappear any moment. But the masses had other ideas. 

Despite the Tsar's forces firing live rounds into the crowds day after day, the crowds wouldn't disperse. This open brutality had a decisive effect on the consciousness of the soldiers. The Pavlovsk regiment of soldiers was ordered to fire on demonstrators on Feb 26. *Instead, they turned their guns on the police!*

On paper, the Tsar had millions of soldiers at his disposal. In reality, he didn't even have enough loyal men to guard the train stations or telephone network in the capital city. 

After Feb 27, the majority of the city was in the hands of the workers and soldiers. And with Petrograd went the whole country. This demonstrates the power of the working class when it moves. No force on earth can stop it once that happens. 

The workers had power in their hands, but weren't organized enough or conscious enough to really wield it. The demands of the revolution were fundamentally bourgeois-democratic. However, as we know from [[The Permanent Revolution (1931)]], the bourgeoisie had played a totally reactionary role. 

It was the bourgeoisie that now jumped into action. Sensing the impossibility of drowning the revolution in blood, they now desperately attempted to steer events in their favor. A Provisional Government was set up by the speaker of the Duma. 

This Provisional Govt had no real base of support. It only lived as long as it was propped up by the Mensheviks and the SRs. These organizations held enough sway to get the workers to allow the formation of this new government, even if many still didn't trust it. 

Enter [[Kerensky]]. He was a middle-class careerist lawyer who had a flair for the dramatic. His 'left image' and fiery rhetoric perfectly embodied the confused, naive stage that the awakening of the workers was at. 

On March 2nd, the PG was formally formed. This was a through-and-through government of the bourgeoisie, for the bourgeoisie. Their main goal was to conserve as much of the regime as possible. To this end, they sought to give to the workers only what the workers had already taken, and then stop their advance. 

## The Bolsheviks in February
The Bolsheviks had only 2,000 formal members in Petrograd when the revolution happened. Out of 400,000 workers, you can see this wasn't a lot of people. But their cadre was the most well-trained out of any organization. 

However, the leadership of the Bolsheviks in Petrograd was pretty bad. They had a tendency to fail to grasp the moment. They were career party practicos, who were more suited to the day-to-day operations. 

The Party was caught off-guard by the whole series of events, and had even tried to talk down the women workers from their initial actions on Womens' Day. However, they soon regained their footing, and moved into action.

Arsenals were raided, and a Bolshevik organized a fighting squad out of the Putilov strikers who attacked the police and seized their weapons. The order was given to attempt to use their influence to transform the general strike into an armed insurrection. The workers didn't need much urging. 

Bourgeois historians say that the February revolution was spontaneous. It was, insofar as no party declared its official beginning or anything. However, any strike has leaders, those who walk through the managers door to present demands. This revolution might not have been called by the Bolsheviks, but across the city, most of the events of the revolution were led by Bolshevik workers who the others looked towards due to their political clarity. 

However, the leadership was outpaced by events. The rank-and-file proved to be more revolutionary than this leadership. 

## The Mensheviks and the February Revolution
In the elections to the Soviet, there were lots more soldiers' deputies than workers' ones due to a skewed voting system. The soldiers were usually peasants, who tended to elect intellectuals and those who were more educated from among their ranks. These people tended to gravitate towards the Mensheviks and SRs. 

The majority of the Menshevik leaders were defencists (those who supported a defensive war against Germany) but there were some internationalists like Martov. These figures were centrists, in that they stood between Marxism and reformism. 

While the Bolsheviks had a lot of support from the workers, the Mensheviks had an advantage. They offered an easy way out for the masses who were just now beginning to ponder the more abstract political questions. No need to continue fighting, we could just relax and let the bourgeoisie take power, under the watchful eye of these Menshevik representatives of course. 

The Petrograd Soviet had an executive committee made up of representatives from the workers and peasants. It had its own paper, and it was the *de facto* power across Russia. If the workers and peasants were conscious of their power, they could have immediately began the re-organization of society. Unfortunately, this consciousness didn't yet exist. 

The united front of Mensheviks and SRs who controlled the Soviets were terrified of spooking the capitalists into the camp of reaction. Therefore, they refused to challenge property in the major economic sectors and finance, and refused to end the war. Instead, they marked time and tried to calm the masses down. 

While the workers and soldiers asked the Soviet to seize power, the Mensheviks and SRs were deciding whether to enter a formal alliance with the capitalists directly, or to "control the Provisional Government from outside" via the Soviet. 

## The Bolsheviks and the Provisional Government
While the leadership of the Bolsheviks tended to vaccilate when Lenin wasn't around, the rank-and-file in Petrograd were pretty in-tune with events. They issued a manifesto that put them on a collision course with those who were trying to halt the revolution. 

This all stopped when the exiles Kamenev and Stalin arrived. They immediately set the Party on a rightward course correction, closer to the Mensheviks. They were unable to withstand the petty bourgeois sentiments of victory and unity that swirled around them in those days. Across the country, many Bolshevik and Menshevik committees merged spontaneously, as people were taken in with a short-sighted spirit of conciliationism. 

Kamenev outright renounced Lenin's anti-war policy in a *Pravda* editorial, and Stalin agreed, albeit more cautiously. 

In March, the Party held their first All-Russian conference since the overthrow of the Tsar. They discussed the orientation towards the war, and towards the PG. All the leadership was there except for Lenin, who was still stuck in Switzerland. 

Stalin gave a speech on the Party's orientation towards the PG. His position was that the Party should remain outside the government, but should support it with some reservations. This was antithetical to Lenin's line, which was that the Party needed to distance itself from all bourgeois parties and governments. Stalin's position wasn't unanimously supported, and the resolution eventually adopted by the Conference made some points about the inability of the PG to solve the contradictions in Russia. 

Stalin's position was that the Soviets could coexist with the PG, and that the Bolsheviks could put their program into effect without directly challenging the PG. The Stalin-Kamenev line even flirted with fusion with the Mensheviks. Stalin really didn't see that much of a difference between Bolshevism and Menshevism, stemmin from his narrow-minded existance as a party practico. 

## Lenin and Trotsky in 1917
Lenin watched the events of February with anxiety. He immediatley telegraphed his position to Petrograd:

> Our tactic: no trust in and no support of the new government; Kerensky is particularly suspect; arming of the proletariat is the only guarantee; immediate elections to the Petrograd City Council; no rapprochement with other parties.

Lenin began to send his famous *Letters from Afar* for publishment in *Pravda.* Their tone fell like a bombshell on the Bolsheviks, who were mired in vaccilation. However, their content and tone was censored by Stalin and Kamenev, who always prefered taking the line of least resistance when it came to politics. Since Lenin wasn't around, they could simply censor Lenin to prevent an internal conflict.

Lenin also came over to a position on the nature of the revolution quite similar to the one Trotsky put forward much earlier: 

> Ours is a bourgeois revolution, _therefore_ the workers must open the eyes of the people to the deception practiced by the bourgeois politicians, teach them to put no faith in words, to depend entirely on their _own_ strength, their _own_ organisation, their _own_ unity, and their own _weapons_.

Trotsky was really the only other leading figure that was saying the same thing as Lenin during this time. Trotsky, when he heard of the February Revolution, immediately started writing articles quite similar to the ones Lenin was authoring. 

Much effort has been made by the Stalinists to hide this fact, but Lenin and Trotsky were of one mind, halfway across the world from one another, standing against the horrible decisions being made by Stalin and Kamenev, along with the Mensheviks. 

## Lenin Rearms the Party
In April, Lenin finally arrived in Petrograd. He was forced to fight a sharp internal battle to undo the damage done by Kamenev and Stalin. Luckily, the rank and file (and the working class even more so) was more revolutionary than the leading layers of the Bolsheviks. Some sections of the city even called for the expulsion of Kamenev and Stalin. 

He attempted to start a total about-face in the tone of the Party towards the PG. This shocked many, since it was such a different message than the rest of the leadership had been saying. 

The factional struggle culminated in the April Conference, a meeting of delegates representing 79,000 Bolsheviks from across the country. Lenin faced off against many of the 'Old Bolsheviks' who were stubbornly clinging to Lenin's old slogan "for the democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants," even as Lenin himself said this slogan was now redundant in the face of a bourgeois government. 

Fortunately, while Lenin was in the minority of the leadership, the membership was behind him. Lenin firmly made the case that while socialism was materially impossible in Russia, the working class of Russia still had a historical role to play in the world socialist revolution.  

Lenin also maintained that the Bolsheviks needed to maintain independence from all other parties, despite the concilliatory mood. Stalin disgreed, seeing the differences in theory as trivial, and thinking of everything from a bureaucratic, organizational perspective. Why not take some ideological shortcuts if it meant more members and a wider reach?

Lenin was always for unity *on the basis of actual agreement*, not on the basis of compromise on the key questions. 

## The First Coalition
The masses of discontented soldiers had a powerful drive to make their voices heard during and after the events of February. From their ranks emerged a document titled Order Number One, which listed their demands for a democratic organization of the Army and the extension of freedoms to the soldiers. 

Of course, this was bad news in the ears of the Provisional Government. They tried to stop news of this Order from spreading, with help from the SRs and Mensheviks who were eager to 'restore order.' But it was no use. The situation was becoming explosive. 

In a general formula of r evolution, as the period of intoxicated illusions in the bourgeois gains ends, and the masses begin to sense that nothing has really changed, the advanced layer (who sense this change most intensly) instinctively lashes out, and tries to call the rest of the class to action. But the more backwards layers still have faith in the new system, and aren't ready to fight. If the advanced layer pushes ahead without mass support, they will be cut down by reaction. It is the revolutionary party's duty to restrain them until the masses are in a position to fight again. This exact situation was happening. 

Demonstrations against the continuation of the war erupted in Petrograd. These workers only dispersed under the instruction of the Soviet, after defying the Provisional Government. 

Finally, sensing the need for a real coalition to maintain order, the 'socialist' ministers entered the Provisional Government. These Mensheviks and SRs took up positions within the PG such as the ministry of labor and agriculture. This was a turning point. Now the soldiers and workers could "compare words and deeds" of these so-called socialists.

Crucial to the Bolsheviks success was that they stayed out of this coalition. Now they could provide a real alternative to the rest of the Russian 'left.' However, there was still an uphill battle. The masses were still quite ready to believe the tales that the reformists were spinning, since they had just defeated the Tsar and Russia had supposedly already been liberated. 

While the advanced layer of the workers and soldiers in Petrograd were ready to break with the Provisional Government, Lenin maintained that the Bolsheviks needed to hold their horses. It was important to wait until the more backwards layers of the working class and the advanced peasants had time to see that the Provisional Govt and the reformists were frauds. It would have been suicide to take up the banner of insurrection at a time where many still supported the state. 

Between January and April, the Bolsheviks had gone from 8,000 to 16,000 members. These new recruits knew very little if anything about Marxism, but knew that they wanted revolution, and they wanted it now.

## 'All Power to the Soviets'
Lenin has been defamed as a conspirator who wanted to seize power with a small revolutionary minority. This is totally false! Lenin was insistent that the masses needed to be won to the cause before a revolution could take place, even as many new members of the Party called for immediate action. 

The slogan 'Down with the provisional government' was making the rounds. Lenin called this ultra-left, saying that the masses still supported the PG. Lenin knew the task facing the Bolsheviks was not the conquest of power, but *the conquest of the masses*. 

Lenin understood that 90% of the work of a revolutionary is to win over the masses by propaganda, agitation, explanation, and organization. This is why he denied that the Bolsheviks stood for civil war or violence. He placed the onus for violence on the ruling class which had chance after chance to avoid it. To do otherwise would be [[Blanquism]], or the tactic of seizing power through a coup led by a clique of revolutionaries. Lenin said as much:

> To speak of civil war before people have come to realise the need for it is undoubtedly to lapse into Blanquism.” (LCW, The 7th (April) All-Russia Conference of the RSDLP(B), vol. 24, p. 236)

In order to prevent local leaders from running ahead of events, the Central Committee of the Bolsheviks passed a resolution on April 21 stating that no propagandist or speaker should say that the Bolsheviks support civil war, or violence. 

The most famous slogan of the Bolsheviks during 1917 was "All power to the soviets!" Even though the Bolsheviks were a minority in them at the time, they knew the task was to win over the masses who still had illusions in reformism. Therefore, by making [[Marxists should use positive demands]] on the reformist leaders of the soviets, they could reveal these reformists to be frauds while setting themselves up to lead the masses in revolution. They knew that the reformists would never take power from the Provisional Government, and if they did, then the Bolsheviks could struggle peacefully within them, as the reformists would have ushered in the beginnings of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] anyway. 

Lenin advocated for a peaceful revolution, and this could have been achieved if the reformists leading the soviet only said the word. Such a majority supported them that there could have been no counterattack by the Provisional Government. However, the reformists prevented such an outcome, guaranteeing the convulsions that would strike Russia later. 

This stands in stark contrast with the lies painted about Lenin, both from bourgeois snakes who want you to think he was a blood-crazed maniac, and the ultra-leftists who want you to think he advocated immediate warfare against class society regardless of the context!

## The June Days
One of the central demands of the Bolsheviks was the arming of the workers, and the workers were carrying this out themselves without waiting to be told. Workers militia were forming in working class neighborhoods to keep order, and even go on the offensive against reactionaries and unpopular managers and bosses. 

Under the Marxist definition of state power, the Petrograd working class already constitued a state power. It had 85 militia centers that totally controlled the city by March. On April 28, the Left Mensheviks organized a conference to set up the Red Guard. This organization was open to any worker who could prove membership to a socialist party or union, and who had been approved by an election in their workplace. They moved in squads of 10, and elected their officers. The whole apparatus would be controlled by a district soviet, which were mainly held by the Bolsheviks. 

On the eve of October, the Red Guards had 100,000 members across the country. From the point of the creation of the Red Guard onwards, the Bolsheviks could order the transfer of state power whenever they wanted. Now the real trick was deciding when the masses had learned enough lessons from the conduct of the reformists in the soviets and the capitalists in the Provisional Government. 

The real issue in Lenin's mind was how to *prevent* the workers in Petrograd from taking power too soon. If that happened, and it could have happened any time after June, the rural masses would probably have rushed to the defense of the Provisional Government, drowning the revolution in blood. 

The Bolsheviks planned to stage an armed demonstration coinciding with the first All-Russian Congress of Soviets. This was both to pressure the reformists to take power, but also to vent some of the building presure of the Petrograd workers. The Soviet leaders were terrified Lenin was using this as cover to take power, and began attacking the idea viciously. The Bolsheviks called it off, and the reformists decided to hold their own rally.

To their shock, the workers who attended this rally carried signs with Bolshevik slogans on them, calling for a break with the bourgeoisie and the taking of power. This terrified the reformists, and was even surprising to the Bolsheviks. It demonstrated the true mood of the Petrograd workers. 

## The July Days
On July 1st, Kerensky announced a new offensive in the war. This brought forth pro-Tsarist demonstrations by the reactionaries, who sensed that initiative had passed to them in the struggle. 

At the Congress of Soviets, the Bolsheviks argued against the offensive, saying that it would strengthen the reactionary tendency in the armed forces and place the revolution in danger. If the offensive succeded, it could lure a layer of the petty bourgeois over to the camp of reaction. If it failed, it could demoralize the who army, demobilizing the masses. The latter event is what happened in the end. 

The mood of the soldiers was very explosive. In Petrograd, a regiment of machine gunners decided that it was time to overthrow the PG. Sections of the Bolsheviks agreed, but the Central Committee firmly opposed any attempt to seize power. However, the Bolsheviks couldn't hold back the anger this time. On July 3rd, a directionless flood of soldiers poured onto the streets of Petrograd. The Bolsheviks attempted to calm the situation, while anarchists and Black Hundred agents attempted to get the crowd to arrest the leaders of the Soviet. 

By July 4th, the Bolsheviks decided to participate in events to give the protest a more organized, peaceful character. It was extremely difficult to talk down the crowd, especially the soldiers and sailors. Trotsky went to Kronstadt to ask the sailors to release Chernov, who they had arrested. He was berated and yelled at, and feared for his life at one point. The sailors were at the ends of their wits, demanding that the Soviet take power. 

A crowd of workers broke into the room where the leaders of the Soviet were meeting, and demanded that they seize power from the Provisional Government. Kerensky ordered troops from the front to return to the city, and the leaders of the Soviet began a counterattck, hand in hand with the Provisional Government. This attack was carried out against the masses, and against the Bolsheviks, despite the fact that the latter had tried to restrain events. There was a wave of arrests, beatings, and murders throughout the city. The offices of *Pravda* were destroyed, and the Bolsheviks had to go into hiding. 

## After the July Events
The Provisional Government reconstitued itself, in the Second Coalition. Kerensky was in charge again. The PG saw that this was their opportunity to restore order and crush the left wing, the Bolsheviks. Lenin was portrayed as a German agent in the press, all the papers of which called for the destruction of the Bolsheviks. 

Demonstrating their character, the Mensheviks and SRs stood meekly by, and even called for Lenin and the other leaders to hand themselves over to "justice" at the hands of the state. On July 6th, the PG issued warrants for the arrest of Lenin, Kamenev, and Zinoviev. 

Lenin wanted to give himself up and use the trial as a platform to agitate, but was convinced out of it by the members of the CC. Instead, he went into hiding. 

After the Bolsheviks appeared to have been crushed, the reactionaries turned their fury on the workers movement in general. The Duma demanded the dissolution of the Soviets, the reintroduction of the death penalty, and the re-establishment of bourgeois order at all levels.

Trotsky issued an open letter to the Provisional Government, calling them out for their bullshit excuses for the arrest of the Bolshevik leaders, and was himself arrested. 

## Lenin Changes His Mind
In hiding in a small Finnish village, Lenin was pessimistic. He over-estimated the strength of the counter-revolution and worried about being killed. He wrote to Kamenev asking that the latter publish Lenin's notebook, 'Marxism on the State' if Lenin was killed. This was to become [[The State and Revolution (1917)]]. 

Lenin believed that the July Events had done away with the Soviets as a revolutionary force, and that a peaceful route for the Russian revolution had been closed. He said that now the Bolsheviks ought to prepare for an insurrection, based on the factory committees instead of the Soviet. This was premature, but reasonable to conclude at the time.

Through thick and thin, Lenin's eyes were trained on the classes *behind* the organizational forms such as the soviets. He never fetishized them or sought to manuver within them in backroom deals. He gave the Sovet importance based on the fact that the workers were looking to the soviet for guidance. 

Despsite everything, and counter to Lenin's prediction, the July events didn't impact the Bolsheviks that much. Within a few weeks, they were growing in number and influence again. Their ideas began to get more traction within the soviets. There was a steady rise in the power of the left flank of both the SRs and the Mensheviks within the lower soviets, even as the top representatives moved to the right. 

## Trotsky and the Bolshevik Party
Marx said that theory becomes a material force when it grips the minds of the masses. Correct revolutionary theory should allow a party to anticipate the main course of events, and correctly orient their forces and anticipate these events. 

The theory that most accurately predicted the course of events in 1917 was Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]].  The Menshevik theory of the bourgeois-democratic stage of revolution was put to the test, and found wanting. It was used to justify repression and counter-revolution in July. 

The differences between Lenin and Trotsky had totally evaporated by this point. As soon as he joined the Bolsheviks at the Sixth Congress in August, he was elected to the Central Committee. Trotsky brought with him an important group of his supporters, the Mezhraiontsy. Trotsky had waited so long to formally join the Bolsheviks in the interest of bringing this group along with him with its 3-4,000 revolutionaries.

Lenin was eager to get fresh blood into the Bolsheviks, in order to dilute the conservatism of the Old Bolsheviks at the top. This new group was especially good since they were experienced theoreticians, propagandists, and writers. 

## The Kornilov Rebellion
The counter-revolution was still proceeding on shaky ground. They were compelled to hide their reaction behind "defense of the Soviet." This meant they weren't totally able to crush all resistance. In August, the Bolsheviks were able to resume publication. 

The Bolsheviks met and decided to not go through with the change in tactics that Lenin had proposed. This alarmed him, and he predicted that a military clique would soon try and take power if the Soviet refused it. These words proved to be prophetic.

Despite his prophetic words, Lenin was for once the one in the wrong on the Bolshevik CC. The Soviets were still a revolutionary organ of the working class, despite the rightward drift of its leadership. 

On the surface, the pendulum was still swinging to the right. [[Kornilov]] was installed as the leader of the Russian Army. He was a narrowminded son of a Cossack who saw every problem through the sights of a rifle. He insisted on the reintroduction of the death penalty at the front. He had a larger program for counterrevolution, but had to negotiate with Kerensky, who still ruled the state in name.

On August 25th, Kornilov's troops began advancing on Petrograd, claiming that they were going to "save the Provisional Government from a Bolshevik coup" that was entirely fictional. The real plot was to overthrow the Provisional Government and institue a military dictatorship. 

The workers and the Bolsheviks understood the need to defend the bourgeois Provisional Government against the open forces of reaction. At the same time, the Bolsheviks refused to support Kerensky's government in words. 

This was Lenin's essential tactic in 1917: to outflank the reformists instead of attacking them directly. He would attack the main enemy, the bourgeois reactionaries and landlords, and in doing so demonstrate the inability of the reformists and vaccilators to do such a thing. 

The Bolsheviks used their Military Organization to create a Committee of Struggle to organize the defense against Kornilov. It united the whole Soviet movement, but relied on the Bolsheviks' determination to fight and professional structure. 

Using revolutionary means, the Bolsheviks called for the railroad workers to strike and derail the trains moving troops towards the [[capital]]. Then, agitators convinced most soldiers to stop fighting, and arrest their officers. The coup was stopped by the working class in its tracks.

## The Struggle for the Masses
The decisive area for struggle was within the Soviets. This is where the Bolsheviks turned all of their attention. The leadership of these organizations was still decidedly reformist, and supported the Provisional Government "insofar as it did this or that." While the Soviets were a good barometer of the mood of the masses, they still lagged behind events by a few days. The Bolsheviks were stronger in the factory committees, where the will of the masses was closer to the leadership. 

Between August and September, the makeup of the Soviets shifted leftward dramatically. On September 9th, the session of the Congress of the Soviets was especially heated. The question on the table was a straight vote on if the soviet should take power. The leading speaker for the Bolsheviks was Trotsky, who directed fire at the bourgeoisie and Kerensky, rather than the reformists. The final votes were 414 in support of the Soviet - PG coalition, and 519 against. 

The tide was now flowing in favor of the Bolsheviks. They began to win majorities all across Russian soviets. However, their gains in the unions were slower. The machinery of bureaucracy moved slowly, and the leaders of the unions reflected the sentiment of previous months and years. Despite this inherent tendency towards Menshevism. the Bolsheviks also made strides in the unions, particularly among the newly unionizing industries where the workers were fresh. 

Up until August, the Bolsheviks were a small part of the working class. They were the smallest faction in the Soviets before August, as well as in the trade unions and local councils. 

The skillful opposition to Kornilov catapulted the Bolsheviks into prominence. The working class really saw who the real defenders of the working class were. 

The Bolsheviks fought for the leadership of the working class everywhere, in the trade unions, the soviets, in the military organizations, in the factory committees. And they were winning. 

## Tactics of the Insurrection
Lenin, from his hiding place in Finland, studied every fact he could find on the question of when the party ought to strike. While the SRs still had majorities outside of the major cities and industrial areas, a left current was developing within the organization, and the Bolsheviks were making major strides all across the country. 

Because the Bolsheviks were the decisive force in the majority of the soviets, he thought the time was ripe and the Party should not delay in announcing the seizure of power. 

Lenin bombarded the Central Committee with letters demanding that the Bolsheviks begin organizing the insurrection. After the others kept delaying and delaying responses to his arguments, he even threatened to resign from the Central Committee and agitate for insurrection among the rank-and-file directly!

## Crisis of Leadership
Lenin was anxious that the CC would vaccilate at the key moment, and wanted to really lock them into insurrection by beginning preparations immediately. 

The Mensheviks, seeing power slip from their hands, called a Democratic Conference, at which "experts" would discuss the idea of taking power. They tilted representation away from the workers and towards petty bourgeois elements. To Lenin's disgust, the Bolshevk CC voted to participate. 

At this conference, the reformists set up a 'pre-parliament' which the Bolsheviks also agreed to participate in. This was a huge blunder. This organization was designed to give the impression that Russia already had a parliamentary democracy, and served to confuse the masses. In fact, the pre-parliament was an appendage of the Provisional Government, and had only consultave rights. 

After a struggle, Lenin got the CC to withdraw from the pre-parliament. 

Lenin travelled in disguise to Petrograd to meet with the CC to discuss insurrection. He tore them a new one. It is not uncommon for the leadership of the revolutionary party to begin to vaccilate when the date of insurrection approaches. They feel more and more pressure, and there are always lots of unknowns. This stretches nerves to the breaking point and exposes all weakness. 

## The Question of the Soviet Congress
We can contrast bourgeois strategy in war with revolutionary strategy. A bourgeois state's primary task is military, and the secondary task is rallying morale and public opinion. A revolutionary party's role is reversed. The working class is so strong that the military question is already answered. The real task is to convince the workers of their own strength and rally them to the cause. 

In order to do this, it is necessary to begin with a defensive struggle, merge it with offensive struggle, all while placing all the responsibility for violence on the shoulders of the ruling class. Only in this way can we win over the masses, who value peace. 

Lenin wanted to move forward with the insurrection immediately, while Trotsky wanted to wait until the Congress of the Soviets so that the Bolsheviks would have more legitimacy to speak for the whole working class. 

Kamenev and Zinoviev were pessimistic, thinking that the government would crush the insurrection and that soldiers and workers loyal to the Bolsheviks would flee. They had no faith in the working class, having been infected by bourgeois public opinion.

Lenin tried to get the Bolsheviks to declare insurrection immediately, but they wavered, demonstrating excessive caution after July. This meant that the insurrection would be timed with the Congress of Soviets after all.

## The Final Chapter
Ninety percent of the work had been accomplished before the insurrection began, and that's why it was relatively peaceful. The Bolsheviks had patiently won over the workers to their perspective, and this fact was reflected in their majorities in the Soviets. 

Lenin's fears that the Bolsheviks were moving too slowly were reasonable, but partially due to his isolation from the ground. Trotsky, on the other hand, could move more freely among the masses, and supported the correct stance, of timing the insurrection with the Congress of the Soviets. Lenin was worried it would be postponed by the reformists. 

At this point, the Bolsheviks were growing so fast that the party apparatus was breaking. In two months, the membership had gone from 240,000 to 400,000 at least. 

But even with 400,000 Bolsheviks, the masses still looked to the Soviets as the legitimate authority. This meant that without the Soviets, the Bolsheviks were bound to be defeated. But without Bolshevik policies, the Soviets were being used as tools of reaction (in the final analysis) by the reformists. 

## The Seizure of Power
On October 19th, a secret meeting of the amplified CC took place. Only two people voted against insurrection - Kamenev and Zinoviev. These two even went to the lengths of publishing their position in a non-party newspaper! This gave away key information to the enemy, and was a serious breach of democratic centralism. 

Lenin denounced these two and, uncharacteristically, called for their removal from the party. However, this didn't happen, and the two were accepted back into the party after the insurrection with not much harm done. This was before the Stalinist tactics of forced confession and trials. 

When the tide is flowing with the leadership, good decisions are amplified and mistakes are forgiven. This was true for the Bolsheviks, and the opposite was true for the leadership of the reactionaries. Mistakes were amplified, and it was just such a mistake the Provisional Government made when it ordered two thirds of the Petrograd garrison to the front. 

This enraged the soldiers and workers, and made it clear that the government was going to move against the revolution. It wanted to get rid of the revolutionary soldiers so that it could act. 

The Soviet refused to give its signature to this action, and began a chain of events. The Bolsheviks led the agitation campaign against this action, and advocated setting up a Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee. This MRC appointed commisars to every store and arms depot, controlling the flow of weapons and ammo. 

Trotsky ordered a small arms factory to issue 5,000 rifles to the Red Guard, provoking terror among the bourgeoisie about a coming massacre. However, no massacre was needed. The Bolsheviks had done the political work that made the military work redundant. 

For example, when taking over the Peter and Paul fortress. The soldiers had refused to recognice the MRC, and some wanted to attack the fortress. However, instead Bolsheviks entered unarmed and held a mass meeting of the soldiers, where they convinced them to arrest their own commander and open the gates.

> - Lenin

## Was October a Coup?
No. If anything, the revolutionaries went too easy on the forces of reaction. They often let their enemies go home if they promised not to fight any more. Even when the civil war began to spark up, when a White general was captured, he was allowed to go free on the condition that he not return to the fight. Of course, he immediately did so. 

The awakeing and active participation of the masses lies at the heart of every revolution. They moved to change society. 

> The awakening of the masses, their active participation, their initiative and creative power, lies at the heart of every great revolution. It was displayed in a truly spectacular fashion in the nine months that separated the February from the October Revolution. Time and time again, in February, in May, in June, in July, in September, the masses moved to transform society. If they did not immediately succeed, that was not for lack of trying, but because every time they were thrown back by their leaders, who stubbornly refused to take the power when it was presented to them on a plate. How many times since then have we seen the same thing? In Germany in 1918, 1920, and 1923; in Britain in 1926 and 1945; in Spain in 1936; in France in 1936 and again in 1968; in Portugal in 1974–75; in Italy in 1919–20, in 1943 and in 1969, and throughout the 1970s; in [[Pakistan]] in 1968–69; in [[Chile]] in 1970–73, and in many other countries throughout the world. In every case, after the leadership has thrown away the possibility of changing society even by peaceful means and prepared the victory of reaction, the same cynics wheel out the same tired old arguments: that the objective situation was not ripe; that the balance of forces was unfavourable; that the masses were not ready; that the state was too strong, and so on and so forth. The blame for defeat is always placed at the feet of the soldiers who fought, but never on the generals who refused to lead. And if, instead of Lenin and Trotsky, the leadership of the Bolshevik Party had been in the hands of Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev, these same ladies and gentlemen would now be writing, with an impressive battery of facts, how the Russian Revolution was doomed to defeat from the beginning, on account of the hopelessness of the objective situation, the unfavourable class balance of forces, and the ‘immaturity’ of the masses.

## The Triumph of Bolshevism
The seizure of power went so smoothly that opponents didn't realize it was happening until it was over. It went smoothly because of the meticulously planned military preparations, and the political work that had been done beforehand. The Bolsheviks had spent time ensuring that there were no opponents to this seizure of power. 

On the evening of October 24th, the Red Guards began to occupy bourgeois newspapers and use their machinery to print revolutionary propaganda. Soldiers ordered to stop them refused. Overnight, Red Guards occupied key points in the city - telegraphs, railroad stations, post offices. By 10am, the Winter Palace was surrounded. 

## The Struggle at the Congress
The Congress of the Soviets took place while the seige of the Winter Palace was still ongoing. Out of 670 delegates, there were 300 Bolsheviks, 193 SRs (about half were left SRs), and 82 Mensheviks. 

The Bolsheviks still had a pestering problem with conciliationism right until the end and beyond. Some wanted a coalition with the right wing "to prevent civil war." Such a coalition would have amounted to throwing the whole revolution away. 

The victory of the insurrection wasn't the final challenge of the revolution. The enemies of the Bolsheviks would mount a counter-attack, aided by 21 foreign armies. The civil war would last four long years. 

Trotsky fashioned the Red Army out of the broken corpse of the Tsarist military. Lenin and Trotsky used the Communist International ([[Comintern]]) to rally the workers of the world against the threats to the Russian revolution.
