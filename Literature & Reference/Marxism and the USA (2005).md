# Introduction
It is a common misconception, Woods begins, to say that the US is nothing but a basiton of "the evil empire" that has provided nothing useful in the way of revolutionary ideas or movements. False! 

## The USA and the world
Woods says 9/11 caused a general sense of insecurity to grip the nation. This totally ended the streak of isolationism which often rears it head in American politics. 

According to the author, the [[USA]] finds itself playing the role that the [[UK]] once played - that of world policeman. But while the [[UK]] played this role during [[capitalism]]'s ascent, the US now polices a diseased and degrading world. 

The author says that the phenomenon of anti-Americanism is strongest in the poor countries of South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. These feelings are a result of the economic [[imperialism]] and resource extraction that the American [[bourgeoisie]] carries out there. 

This exploitation is being carried out quite effectivley, he says, indicated by the low cost of raw materials these days. 

## Europe and America
Some in Europe also have anti-American feelings, Woods explains. They resent the second-fiddle position that Europe now plays, and feel inferior economically to the US. This is warranted, as the last 100 years have been the history of the decline of Europe and the rise of the [[USA]]. The 'center of the world' has now shifted from the Medeterranean, to the Atlantic, to the Pacific. 

Woods reminds us that just as Tsarist [[Russia]] was the world center of reaction just before 1917, so too could America make a [[dialectics|dialectical]] turn from center of world [[capitalism]] to the impetus for a world revolution.

# 1. Blood from every pore
## A 'un-American' idea?
Most Americans, just like most around the world, only think of the caricature of [[Stalinism]] when they hear the words [[Marxism]] or [[communism]]. This is why there has been difficulty spreading these ideas among Americans so far. 

The American bourgeoisie would like us to think of communism as a foreign import, that has no place in our country. Instead, the truth is that communism has deeper roots in North America than capitalism does. The indigenous population that lived here before colonization had no concept of private property in land, had no prison system, and were totally removed from class society in general. 

If anything, it was capitalism which was foribly imported to the continent, through genocide, slavery, and war. This system replaced the deeply democratic system that governed most native tribes, where communal democracies determined all decisions for the tribal group. 

## Genocide of the first Americans
At the first contact of the Europeans with the indigenous population, the naivite of the natives was rewardes with enslavement and eventually genocide of whole populations in the name of profit. 

Capitalism always destroys the old social system whenever it is imported. We can see similar examples in the expansion of capitalism through Europe. However, the American example is unique in its brutality and its racial component, where natives were treated as sub-human. 

## "Custer's last stand"
The heroic battles fought in defense of their civilization by the natives against the colonists are portrayed as brutal acts of agression against peaceful whites. This could not be further from the truth. From Custer's defeat, rewritten as a heroic last stand, to Wounded Knee, we can see the truth of the conflict if we peel back the layer of imperialist and racist propaganda. 

## Forgotten aspects of American history
We need some context to analyze the arrival of the Pilgrims. They were [[religion|religious]] refugees, fleeing Britain just after the death of Cromwell. During this period, the English bourgeoisie made a compromise with reaction and invited the Catholic rule of Charles II from [[France]]. 

During this period in Europe, [[religion]] was tied together with politics, and thus with the perspectives of specific classes or sub-classes. The Catholics represented reaction, the Protestants represented the growing bourgeoisie in the cities. [[Levellers]] and [[Diggers]] represented the lower classes, and even questioned the idea of private property. 

After the failed revolution of Cromwell, the Mayflower set off carrying 102 members of the English lower classes to the New World. 

Those on the Mayflower were Seperatists. This meant that they advocated both religious and secular reform of British society. They wanted property to be held in common and the products of [[labor]] shared. 

The first colony they set up had no private property for the first seven years. The system eventually broke down, because as we know from our basis in Marxism, you cannot will [[socialism]] into existance on the basis of poverty. 

The Pilgrims instituted madatory, free education for all. Of course, they framed this education in religious terms, but it was still a progressive development. 

## Class struggle and slavery
From the beginning, class differences began to develop. This process accelerated with the large amounts of poor Europeans that were coming to the continent. They were imported by the landowners to work the land, but they often succeeded in securing small plots of land for themselves. 

The new class divide necessitated a restriction in democracy by the ruling class. First, voting rights were restricted to church members, then membership in the church became much more exclusive. 

The wages paid to this infant working class were very low. This created problems because many workers decided to set off for the fronteir and try their hand at becoming [[petty bourgeoisie]] themselves. 

The Virginia Colony was based on the cultivation of tobacco by slaves. These slaves were accompanied by indentured servants, Europeans who were basically temporary slaves. They did this either to pay for the voyage, or as punishment for a crime in Europe. 

The first sign of class revolt was Bacon's Rebellion in 1676. Led by Nathaniel Bacon, the revolt of indentured servants burned down the colony of Jamestown. After this, the landowners sought a less rebellious labor source - African slaves.

In South Carolina, the number of black slaves outnumbered the white population after 1700. While slavery played a horrible but economically useful role for a certain time, it soon began to be a weight on the development of American capitalism. The existance of slavery depressed wages for free laborers, and slaveowners were resistance to change and innovation, preferring to stick to old methods. 

# 2. The American revolution
Revolution is supposed to be a foreign concept to the US, just like communism. However, the US was founded by a genuine revolution. 

The American bourgeoisie was chafing under the rule of the British crown, which was imposing taxes and other restrictions on the colonies. While the bourgeoisie are of course a tiny fraction of society, any revolution only succeeds to the degree that it involves the whole of the population. This led the bourgeoisie to call on the masses to help cast off the tyranny of Britain. 

At first, this mainly meant the petit bourgeoisie, who can be rallied to revolution on the basis of their precarious position. But this rallying of the population inevitably made its way down to the lower classes. With a focal point, a banner, and a cause to organize around, these folks became capable of more than their usual disturbances. 

The British military command was well aware of the strategy being used by the American bourgeoisie, although they thought this rabble-rousing was purely the work of 'agitators,' not understanding the material conditions for anger in the lower classes. 

## Role of the masses
Of course, the bourgeois history of the revolution concentrates on the role played by the leadership, the landowners such as Washington. However, it's obvious that the biggest role was played by the masses. It wasn't Washington or Franklin who burned down the homes of tax collectors, nor threw the tea into Boston harbor. The masses are always needed to translate the speeches of the leadership into action.

While the bourgeoisie had a narrow minded power grab in mind, that idea certainly wasn't enough to fire up the masses. A better slogan was needed. Just as Robespierre proclaimed that [[France]] was to be ruled by 'reason, fraternity, and equality,' the Founders were also compelled to create a sparkling veneer on the front of their movement. They did this in the form we know all too well. 

When the revolutionary movement really took off after the Boston Tea Party, the revolutionaries set up Liberty clubs and Committees of Correspondence that were analagous to the soviets later set up in the Russian revolution. They were organs of working-class democracy.

*Note: this seems like a stretch.*

However, these masses were still fighting for reforms that would benefit the owners, not the workers. The outrage against the Stamp Act was felt by those who would never put a tax stamp on a box of [[commodities]] in their lives. 

## The declaration of independence
Delegates to the Continental Congress assembled. They were members of the upper class, who were not really in favor of declaring independence, but the masses had so much revolutionary energy that these delegates felt that they had no way to avoid a direct confrontation with Britain. Therefore, they wrote their Declaration. 

At the time, the Declaration was as radical as [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]] would be 100 years later. Democracy was a novel and mostly untested idea. 

The most glaring hole in the Declaration is the abscence of the question of slavery. The document had been agreed to by all 13 colonies, including the southern slave-owning ones. 

## First shots of the revolution
The movement from below continually forced the leadership of the revolution to take step after step against Britain. After a certain point, the revolution was inevitable, and couldn't have been prevented by any policy or leader. 

The first Continental Congress really aimed to use the threat of independence as a bargaining chip to get the Crown to repeal the taxation. But it found itself strapped into a rocket fueled by the discontent of the lower classes. 

Events themselves forced the situation to develop into open war. The British attempted the arrest of the revolutionary leadership and the confiscation of weapons at Lexington, sparking the first battle of the revolutionary war. 

While the British won the battle at Lexington, they were suddenly beset on all sided by the petit bourgeoisie and the working class, who attacked them out of the shadows at every turn, valiantly putting their lives on the line against the most powerful military on the planet. 

Even in this period, Congress insisted that the temporary governments they were setting up would exist only for the duration of "the present unhappy and unnatural conflict." They were still desperate to halt the revolutionary mobilization of the lower classes. 

## Expropriation of property
The classic liberal refrain was "life, liberty, and property." The Declaration instead included "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This was due to Jefferson. The lower classes were exerting a pressure on the leadership to move in an egalitarian direction.

This pressure even forced some land redistribution in the conflict. The revolutionaries seized the estates of pro-English landowners (without compensation!), and broke them up to be sold to small farmers. This reform was one of the main gains of the revolution overall. 

## George Washington restores 'order'
Before the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Continental Congress assumed direct control over the militias throughout the colonies, and promoted George Washington to lead this new military. 

He immediatley set to work eradicating the revolutionary mood among those who were now soldiers. He enacted court martials, both against insubordinate soldiers and against officers who sought to treat their soldiers as equals. 

Washington was fond of saying that discipline was the soul of an army. This is true, but discipline under class society is far from revolutionary discipline. Under class society, the army will replicate the patterns of the larger social order. Just as class society is held together by force, so is the hierarchy and order of the army. But under revolutionary conditions, the discipline of the fighters is voluntary. Since they all truly have the same interests, repressive methods are not needed to maintain fighting form. 

This is how a revolutionary military like the Red Army was able to do away with the formalities common to other militaries. Officers were treated just like any other soldier, eating, sleeping, and fighting together. Discipline was maintained on the battlefield not out of fear, but out of a genuine desire of the soldiers to fight for their future. 

This was an utterly foreign concept in Washington's army. The heavy hand of discipline on the ranks actually worsened their ability to fight. Washington tried to turn the naturally guerrela force into a standing army, leading to defeat after defeat. 

The real issue was a political one. Congress still wasn't really in favor of independence, and was continually trying to make a deal with Britain. As for Washington, he was far more adept at outmanuvering other wannabe generals in Congress than he was at fighting the British. 

The only thing that really tipped the balance was the involvement of [[France]]. Motivated by hatered of the English, they intervened. No thanks to Washington's military, which had a terrible track record of defeats. 

With the English desire to keep fighting low, and the involvement of France, the British troops pulled out. 

## The new oligarchy
After the British left, the class divisions in the newly-independent US became more severe. The ruling class was torn between the Whigs, who had supported the revolution, and the Tories, who hadn't. The Tories had no choice but to throw in their lot with the winning side of the war. 

The franchise was extended, but was still very strict. While the Americans who had shed their blood for the revolution were still celebrating, the ruling class was furiously attempting to recreate the government model of Britain, designed to exclude as many common people from involvement in the government as possible. 

Another split emerged in the ruling class. The Federalists favored a strong centralized state, and the anti-Federalists rose to meet them. This was really an argument about how best to subjugate the masses, and make sure the state would follow the interests of the bourgeoisie. 

## Shay's rebellion
All revolutions follow general stages. In the first stage, the upswing, the revolutionary edge of the movement leads, as the masses firmly enter the political arena. However, the masses can't stay involved forever. Eventually they feel that they have won, or become apathetic and tired of fighting. It is in this second stage, the downswing, where the conservative edge of the movement gains control. Usually, the revolutionaries can feel this coming and a desperate minority attempts to take control, and is crushed by the forces of reaction. The same process happened in the American revolution.

When the war was over, the petit bourgeois felt that it had given its lives, and gained nothing. Their economic situation, which had compelled them to fight in the first place, was virtually unchanged. 

Serious uprisings gripped Massachusetts and New England in general. An armed mob marched to the NH legislature demanding the crisis be solved by printing [[currency|money]] and lowering taxes on the masses. This demand, while confused as to the real issue, showed the desperate situation of the petit bourgeoisie and lower class. Many were in debtors prisons, up to 90% of the prison population in fact. 

This movement, led by Captain Daniel Shays, a former officer during the revolution and now a broke farmer, culminated in 1,000 armed farmers and workers seizing the courthouse and defending it for several months. 

After the defeat of this uprising by troops paid directly by rich donors due to lack of state funds, the ruling class saw the need to re-organize. 

## The constitution
The 55 delegates that revised the Articles of Confederation all came from the bourgeoisie, to a man. Even the prominent revolutionaries among the ruling class were excluded, such as Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams. Jefferson was away in France as ambassador. 

The Constitution was literally drawn up in secret, behind closed doors, and announced as a suprise to most Americans. 

## America and the French revolution
The international effects of the American revolution were pretty wide. They affected the later French Revolution as well as the infant workers' movement in Britain. 

As for the revolution in [[France]], it also had an effect inside the US. It increased the division between left and right inside Washington's cabinet. Jefferson welcomed it, but the conservative wing was terrified. 

This issue also divided the Federalists and anti-Federalists. Jefferson and the other anti-Federalists supported the French revolution, while the Federalists looked more to England as a model. 

Jefferson, Madison, and Burr combined forces in the Democratic-Republican party. They wanted to go to war against England in support of France, while the Federalists supported a war against France instead. Washington insisted on neutrality. 

## Federalists and Anti-Federalists
This struggle was really the expression of the general struggle between the forces of counter-revolution and those who still believed in the original aims of the revolution. Jefferson even spoke about the need for a second revolution, which wouldn't come until the Civil War. 

When Jefferson was elected president, he attempted to take measures to counteract the Federalist attempt to move the US towards the English model. He banned the use of his face on coins, forbid the celebration of his birthday, and allowed visitors at the White House. 

# 3. Rich and poor
Of course, Jefferson was contradictory. He firmly believed in a more egalitarian vision for the US, with most Americans being small farmers. However, he sought to fulfill this vision by expropriating the land from the native population. 

This vision, which basically amounted to a pre-capitalist society, was impossible. The development of capitalism began to surge forth, made possible by the revolution. This brought all the usual problems along. 

## In a few hands
The gains made by the revolution did not address the plight of the majority, not at all. If anything, they served as a reinforcement of the class society in the US. 

The working conditions throughout the country was abysmal for free workers, to say nothing of the millions of slaves laboring in the south. 

Along with this terror, the class struggle was developing. Even in 1778, unions were already forming in the major cities. The first recorded strike was in 1786 for a minimum wage in the printer's shop. 

## Andrew Jackson
Jackson was born to a poor family, rising to political power on the back of the masses' growing discontent. On his inaguration day, he opened the White House to the public to consume a feast. 

Of course, Jackson was no revolutionary. His party, the [[Democratic Party]] began a strategy of uniting the slave-owners with the political machines in the northern cities. But the people still believed in him despite these machinations. He decried the most obvious excesses of capitalism, such as the bankers and the large corporations. 

This confrontation with the bankers led to what is known as the Bank War. He attempted to abolish the central bank, but this was a utopian concept. A developing capitalist state needed that institution to direct investment and monetary policy. 

Like all previous American leaders, Jackson was a strong proponent of the expansion westward. He intensified and expanded the genocidal campaign to exterminate the natives from the land. 

# 4. The second American revolution
The development of the textile industry in the northeast stimulated the demand for cotton to new heights. This demand, combined with the invention of the cotton gin, caused the slave economy to become a central part of the American economy at large. 

On the surface, there was a divide between the southern capitalists and the northern ones, who liked to think of themselves as more noble. But the capitalists in the north were complicit in the slave trade, and treated their employees almost as bad as the slaves. Additionally, the northern capitalists didn't have to provide housing or make sure their employees were going to show up alive the next day, as there was always another unemployed person to replace them with. 

As a result of their shared class interests, the northern capitalists were lukewarm about abolition, as they didn't want the northern workers to get any ideas about violating the sacred law of property. 

This tenuous ceasefire between the northern and southern capitalists resulted in the various compromises and half-measures that they took towards the solution to this problem. 

At this time, a militant tendency of anti-slavery was growing. John Brown led his militant abolitionist forces in battle against slavers in Kansas, and led the raid on Harper's Ferry, for which he was executed. 

## The Civil War
Similar to the position of the American bourgeoisie during the first revolution, the northern capitalists were in favor of a compromise with the southern side from the beginning. Lincoln was himself in favor of this, and had been a compromise candidate. 

The position of the bourgeoisie was only half the story. The northern working class was largely against slavery, and the abolitionist movement was gaining steam among the lower classes. 

The execution of John Brown was the tipping point. The South began to organize militias that would later make up the base of the Confederate Army, while anti-slavery demonstrations broke out all across the North. It was this pressure that caused the election of Lincoln in 1860. 

Lincoln's election was the spark that caused the secession of one slave state after another. The immediate argument was over tariffs, because the south produced nothing needing tarrif protection, while the north's commodities needed tariffs to protect them from European competition. Instead of growing the domestic economy, the slaveowners were quite content to have the main export of the US be cotton, and were happy to import European goods instead of northern goods. 

Lincoln was compelled by internal division in his party to negotiate with the secessionists. A significant section of the northern capitalists were totally opposed to war, and even the 'abolitionist' capitalists never pursued this agenda with much enthusiasm. Sure, the northern capitalists wanted slavery gone, but they weren't about to go to war over it. 

When war actually broke out, Lincoln assumed a different attitude. He immediatley took charge of the situation, and moved beyond the powers afforded to him in the Constitution to begin war preparations. He suspended habeas corpus, imprisoned thousands without trial, and did away with the independence of [[media]] overnight. He also instituted a tax on the rich to finance the war effort, which was quite a drastic measure at the time. 

These measures lost him a lot of support among the northern bourgeoisie. But these measures were needed to win the war. 

## The problem of leadership
At the start of the war, the South took the offensive. They had better generals, and were willing to go all the way in their push for victory. On the other hand, the North really didn't have its shit together. Its generals were of the same fabric as the northern bourgeoisie, who didn't really have any interest in pushing for victory in the war. They all just wanted to compromise as soon as possible. 

In fact, one of the early Union generals, McClellan, wasn't just a horrible general - he was actively trying to usurp Lincoln. He was in favor of making a deal with the South to end the war behind Lincoln's back. 

Paradoxically, the Northern general Sherman was a supporter of slavery, while Robert E. Lee opposed it while leading the Confederate Army. 

Despite the horrible strategy of the North, the South was doomed by its lack of industry. The Northern fleet was able to easily blockade the South, causing food riots throughout the region, even in Richmond, the [[capital]]. 

## Role of the working class
Profiteers jumped to make a quick buck off the war industries. This meant that despite its revolutionary character, the Civil War led to the centralization of wealth into fewer hands than before. 

Just as in revolution, it is important in a war to have a rallying cry for the masses to participate. Even though those leading the charge may not believe it, they have to agitate the masses to get them to fight. 

The North needed such a rallying cry. It came in the form of the Emancipation Proclaimation. Through this executive order, he appealed directly to the American people to support the war. 

Lincoln also began to allow Black troops to serve in the army, and began to make comments that would make 'progressives' today blush on the topic of labor and unions. 

In the end, the South just couldn't stand up to the industrial power of the North, and they had to surrender. 

> [!Criticism]
> The topic of slave revolts isn't mentioned in this chapter. [[Settlers - The Mythology of the White Proletariat (1983)]] makes these out to seem quite important, and I think it's unlikely that slaves just sat on their hands throughout the South while this was all happening.

## International repercussions of the Civil War
The cotton trade was deeply tied to England, and the English state was supportive of the Southern cause. They would rather America remain a source of cotton rather than compete with England in industry. The only reason that England didn't intervene against the North was in fear of what the working class backlash would have been. 

The International Workingmen's Association (the First International) sided decisively with the North over the South. Marx himself wrote two letters to Lincoln praising his war against slavery. 

## An interesting comparison
It is interesting to compare the Civil War with the French Revolution. In the latter, 7.7% of the population died. But few would argue that the French Revolution was a mistake, or that France would be better off today under a monarchy. 

The Civil War was much bloodier than [[Russia|the October Revolution]], or even the Russian Civil War following it. 

## How capitalism failed African Americans
The Civil War was fundamentally a war won by capitalism. This meant that whatever promises of freedom made to the slaves were doomed to be broken in spirit, if not altogether. The real winners were the northern capitalists, who obtained a new consumer market and a source of dirt-cheap labor. 

Today, we can see in every metric that Black Americans still have a lower standard of living on average. 

The solution to this problem is clear. We need to change the economic basis for the oppression of Black workers, and in order to do that, we need socialism. 

# 5. Labor and [[capital]]
## 'Give me your huddled masses'
After every defeated revolution in Europe, there was an influx of refugees into the United States. 

[[Hegel]] said that if France had the praries of North America, their revolution wouldn't have taken place. This is true, and the West provided a release valve for the tensions of capitalism. The vast amount of uncultivated land in North America gave the economic basis for the "American dream" where anyone could make a life for themselves through hard work. 

Up until the end of the 19th century, the class struggle wasn't very intense in the US and class divisions weren't so noticeable (apart from slavery of course). This allowed the state to be relatively weak, which allowed the US to avoid the burden of bureaucracy and military spending that weighed down European states. 

However, this all began to change when industrial capitalism took off. 

## The golden calf
American capitalism was a progressive force in the 1800s, and the end of the Civil War opened up the path for complete capitalist development. The development of the railroads skyrocketed, with huge state subsidies of course. There was a ton of corruption in this area, with members of Congress profiting 27x their initial investment into the railroad companies that they awarded contracts to. 

The ruling class has always surrounded itself in the 'rags to riches' mythos, but the modern owners of the US are really descended more from criminals and swindlers, who made names for themselves in this era. 

Under Grant, members of his administration recieved huge gifts from lobbyists, that could even include houses and cash payments. 

## Inequality
The monopolization of the American economy was progressing rapidly. Many industries were dominated by 1 or 2 firms. 

The widening gap between rich and poor laid the groundwork for the class struggle. The working class began to organize itself. Due to the severe repression faced by trade union organizers, an underground union developed. It was called the Knights of Labor, founded in 1869. It was open to all workers - including women and Black people. 

The Knights of Labor had a pretty progressive program that included wage increases, the abolition of child labor, and even the public ownership of utilities. 

Against these sprouting organizations, the bourgeoise employed Pinkertons and state forces. 

## The workers' uprising of 1877
In 1876, a downturn gripped the country. Unemployment reached into the millions, adding up to almost 25% in some places. Wages were cut across the board, and meetings of the unemployed were broken up by police. 

Some labor mouthpieces called for a second American revolution. A general strike of the railroad workers broke out in multiple cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and San Francisco. Soldiers were deployed to crush the strike, killing workers in multiple cities. 

The workers responded by torching railroad property. In Baltimore, the situation was so serious that marines were deployed to defend railroad equipment with heavy artillery. 

All across the country, women fought alongside men, Blacks fought alongside Whites. Significantly, there was active participation by the Workers' Party of the United States. 

Marx, who watched these developments with interest, said that it was the first uprising against [[capital]] since the Civil War. He also said that it could mark the birth of a serious workers' party. 

On the second count Marx was premature. The upswing of capitalism following these events proved to be enough to drench the fires of revolt.

## The Chicago Martyrs and May Day
Woods outlines the response to the workers' movement. The bosses met the workers with extreme violence, creating many martyrs. The most significant of these were the martyrs of May Day 1866 in Chicago, which is the reason May 1st is celebrated worldwide.

The author discusses how the American ruling class works to make workers forget their own history. Here in the US, we celebrate "Labor Day" in September, far from the original date that the bosses want us to forget about. We celebrate Labor Day as the last weekend of summer, with grilling and drinking, rather than militant union marches and protests. 

Woods now turns to the events of May 1st, 1866. Albert Parsons (head of the Chicago Knights of Labor) led am 80,000 strong demonstration in Chicago in favor of the eight hour day. They were joined by 350,000 strikers at 1,200 factories in Chicago over the next few days. 

At a rally, Woods continues, the police arrived. While the Chicago police chief was calling for the meeting to disperse, a bomb exploded and killed one cop. In retaliation, the police opened fire, killing seven of their own men along with four workers. Almost 200 were woulded, and the identity of the perpetrator is still unknown. 

Woods describes the consequences. A Red Scare gripped the city, and eight labor leaders including Parsons were tried for the bombing. Even though only two were present at the event, seven were sentenced to execution and one to fifteen years in prison. Fortunately, the sentences were later overturned, but this event fueled the stereotype of radical activists as violent, and contributed to ongoing repression. In November 1886, four [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] leaders were executed. 

Woods ties these events to the present. As the crisis of capitalism deepens, workers must arm themselves with their traditions of struggle, including May Day. The events in Chicago fueled an international movement for the 8-hour day. 

On the international field, Woods explains the effects of the movement. The [[Second International]] was set up in 1889, under the banner of workers' internationalism. It was declared that on May 1 1890 workers worldwide would protest for the 8-hour day, and hundreds of thousands did all across Europe and North America. 

Even [[Engels]], Woods remarks, noted the impact of May Day, saying that a great tradition of international labor was made in the USA.

## Craft unionism
Woods explains the basis for the formation of a new [[labor aristocracy]] in the AFL. The rise of American capitalism as a global force permitted some concessions to the workers. The AFL leaders pursued a craft unionism strategy.

Woods says that in 1881, six unions came together to found the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) which eventually overshadowed the Knights of Labor and was renamed the American Federation of Labor. These leaders expressed a narrow outlook. 

Woods examines the consequences of this new development. These new apolitical craft unions succeeded in turning the labor movement away from socialism. This was a big step back for the movement. 

Citing Lenin, Woods says that apolitical trade unionism is bourgeois trade unionism. It flowed from the economic conditions at the time, where a ascendant American capitalist class could afford to buy off union leaders like Gompers, the president of the AFL. In return, leaders of the AFL preached unity of the classes and sabotaged any attempt at militancy. This was a betrayal of [[class independence]].

The author goes into the paradoxical effects that such a collaborationist attitute has. It actually toughens the resolve of the bosses, who sense weakness on the part of the unions. This is exactly what happened, with the capitalist class implementing more and more union busting techniques even as the AFL leadership made compromises with them. 

Woods argues that this pattern is the eternal paradox of [[reformism]] - weakness and compromise invites agression.

Woods explains the heightening intensity of the class struggle despite the best efforts of the union tops. A strike at the Carnegie steel mills resulted in battles between Pinkertons and workers. [[Eugene Debs]] led a railway strike in 1894 that was only defeated by federal troops. 

## The IWW
Woods outlines the stormy period before and after [[WW1]]. Debs and other leaders helped found the International Workers of the World, or [[IWW]]. Later, Debs would help found the US Socialist Party and run as presidential candidate five times between 1900 and 1920. 

Turning to economic context, Woods describes the rise of the IWW. During the early 1900s, mass production blossomed but the AFL refused to unionize these new industries. The IWW stepped in, and gained prominence in the Colorado mine clashes of 1903 and succeeded in organizing layers of the working class that had never had unions. 

The author says that the leadership included [[Big Bill Haywood]] of the Western Federation of Miners, [[Joe Hill]], and Eugene Debs. Their organization was dynamic, vibrant, and free from routinism. They wanted all workers to be represented in "one big union," as was their slogan. 

Woods explains the heterogeny of their ideas. They had a mix of [[Marxism]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism]]. The preamble to their constitution was stirring:

> “The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things. Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers come together on the political, as well as the industrial, field, and take and hold that which they produce by their labor, through an economic organization of the working class without affiliation with any political party.”

Continuing, Woods says that the IWW believed their unionization activities could form the structure of the new society within the old, and eventually abolish capitalism and run industry through the union. 

Woods agrees that unions are such an embryo of a new society. The IWW united the most advanced and resolute sections of the American proletariat under a banner of open class warfare. 

Woods says that their actions during WW1 unfortunately led to a state crackdown that virtually destroyed the IWW. They were transformed into a small sect. Some of their leaders would later join the American Communist Party. 

Woods explains the reasons for this degeneration into  [[sectarianism]]. It was only partially due to the crackdown. Their attitude towards the AFL was sectarian, which separated them from a large mass of the American proletariat who were organized in that union. Eventually, those workers would split from the AFL and form the CIO. 

## Joe Hill
Woods explains that on November 19, 1915, Joe Hill was executed, having been framed for murder. He was one of the biggest figures in the US labor movement. 

Joe was born in [[Sweden]], Woods elaborates, and immigrated to New York and soon lost his idealism about this new country. He joined the IWW in 1910 and authored dozens of Wobbly songs and poems. 

Woods explains how art and music were weapons of proletarian struggle in the hands of the IWW. Their songs united workers of many nationalities and ethnicities during strikes.

Returning to the story of Joe Hill, Woods says that he arrived in Utah in 1915 and became an enemy of the copper mine owners, who conspired to frame him for a murder. The IWW and allies tried to prevent the execution on flimsy evidence, but failed. One of Hill's final statements was "Don't mourn, organize!" which became a rallying cry across the world. 

## Literature and revolution
Woods says that Joe Hill demonstrated the revolutionary potential of music and poetry. His example was followed by Woody Guthrie and other radical folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger. 

Woods says that it's a shame that most are unaware of the great American tradition of left wing artists. He names the author Jack London, who was an active socialist. In his novel *The Iron Heel,* which both [[Lenin]] and [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] read and liked, London predicted the rise of [[fascism]], long before the rise of [[Hitler]]. Upton Sinclair is also a well known author who was a socialist. 

Woods outlines Sinclair's novel *The Jungle,* and the effects of it. It was an instant best-seller, and actually resulted in legislation that was meant to keep canned meat sales up internationally as disgust spread. 

# 6. Imperialism
Woods outlines the development of [[imperialism]] at the end of the 19th century. The colonial powers fought over markets, territory, and raw material across the globe. The USA, late to the game, was at a disadvantage. The US adopted protectionism, built a strong navy, and established colonial holdings of its own through the war with [[Spain]] in 1898. 

Woods explains that this trend towards empire found its voice in a new generation of politicians. These included Theodore Roosevelt, who advocated an agressive foreign policy. 

The author says that imperialism also played a political role. In Europe, it helped to outsource the class struggle, which was intensifying during the early 1900s. 

Meanwhile in North America, Woods notes, the US adopted the Monroe Doctrine, claiming colonization rights for the Western Hemisphere. 

Woods turns to the Spanish-American war directly. In 1895, the people of [[Cuba]] rose up against their Spanish rulers. The Spanish resorted to rounding up rebels in concentration camps. These events were of great interest to the American capitalists, who had invested over $50 million in the island's industries. 

Due to the American interests at stake, Woods says, a campaign began in the US to involve the American state in "cleaning up the mess" in Cuba. 

Woods relates the efforts to whip up patriotic fervor to the more recent events around the wars in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. In the case of Cuba, the spark was not 9/11 but the sinking of the USS Maine. 

Woods says that it has been said that war is the continuation of politics by other means, and adds that war is also the continuation of business by other means. 

Woods explains that on April 19th, 1898, the US declared war on [[Spain]]. Because of this, the US seized the Spanish colonies of the [[Phillipines]] and Cuba. From the US perspective, the short war was a success with few lives loss and massive territorial gains. 

## The seizure of Panama
Woods describes the fame that the war brought to Teddy Roosevelt. He discovered the power of media spin when it came to war. TR was the face of the American bourgeoisie in its phase of expansion: "crude, vigorous, self-confident, greedy and uncultured." 

Woods contrasts the bourgeoisie in this phase with the leaders of the American bourgeoisie now. Back then, capitalism was in its ascent, and now we see the degradation of the descent of capitalism. We see this in the success of the Spanish-American war, and the total failure of the wars in the Middle East today. Teddy Roosevelt contained the boundless ambition of a bourgeoisie drunk on power, while the leaders of today lack any virtues of their predecessors. 

Woods says that the Spanish-American war was a brief episode in the montage of American success, while for Spain, it was the beginning of a long period of soul-searching that had a revolutionary conclusion. At the peace conference, the USA demanded control over Puerto Rico and the Phillipines. The US paid Spain $20 million to help the latter save face. 

The author says that Roosevelt's hunger now turned towards the passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific - the [[Panama]] canal. Unfortunately, Panama was still controlled by [[Colombia]] at this time, but the US didn't let this stand it its way. The US negotiated to purchase Panama, but when the deal fell through, the US told Panamanian rebels that if they rose up, the US navy would back them. 

Because of this, Woods continues, Panama declared independence in 1903. The newly independent Panamanian leaders handed control of the Panama Canal Zone over to the USA for a song.

## The Phillipine-American War
Woods explains that the value of the Phillipines was in its proximity to East Asia. The US surppressed an armed uprising in the first ten years of the occupation, a short war in which over 4,000 American soldiers died and an estimated one million Filipinos died. 

Woods says that the US imposed many horrific measures on the local population. They herded civilians into concentration camps, burned entire villages, and tortured thousands of people. These tactics would go on to be perfected in the American war on [[Vietnam]].

Woods notes that as in all imperial occupations, racism and nationalism accompanied US intervention. 

## The United States and World War One
Woods says that the entry of the USA into WWI marked a new period of American history. The logic of American foreign policy made such an entry inevitable, just as the logic of global capitalism made the war inevitable. 

Turning to the character of Woodrow Wilson, Woods says this figure was a strange bird. He was no radical, but he was one who sought to reconcile imperialism and capitalism with [[pacifism]].
