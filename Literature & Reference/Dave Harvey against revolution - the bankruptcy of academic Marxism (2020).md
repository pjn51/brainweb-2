> This is an article from *In Defense of Marxism* written about issues with "Marxism" within the [[academy]]. 

The author begins by outlining [[Dave Harvey]]'s background, saying that his series of videos on [[Capital (1867)]] are very popular, and that Harvey recently stated that he is against the revolutionary overthrow of [[capitalism]]. 

Martin notes that there are many possible criticisms of Harvey's ideas, such as the flaws in his theory of "accumulation by disposession." The author accepts that Harvey's lecture series on Das Kapital are a decent introduction, but says that Harvey represents problem common to academics and [[reformism|reformists]].

## Harvey the reformist
Martin asserts that Marxism is far from an academic endeavor or simple tool of analysis. Referencing [[Theses on Feuerbach (1845)]], the author says that [[Marx]] always centered revolutionary practice.

Martin delves into the context in which Harvey made the controversial remarks, and links the lecture in full to avoid distortions or misinterpretations of Harvey's words. 

The author begins by noting that there are two basic premises of his talk that the author agrees with. First of all, Martin explains that Harvey was calling attention to the wave of mass protests around the world recently, including in [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], among others. The author says that Harvey bizzarely added the coup in [[Bolivia]] to the same category, totally missing the qualitative differences between the insurrectionary mass movements elsewhere and what the author calls a rightwing military coup in Bolivia. 

The author claims that no Marxist would put revolutionary movements and counter-revolutionary ones in the same category for analysis, but moves on to Harvey's second point, which he says is that the issue at hand is not "neoliberalism," but [[capitalism]] itself. 

However, Martin points out that Harvey moves on to make a totally contadictory point: he quotes Harvey as arguing that we are in a qualitatively different situation from Marx's day, because most people in the developed capitalist world rely on an industrial food system instead of growing their own food.

Martin attacks this line of thinking as counter-revolutionary, with no basis in reality. He says that workers in Marx's day also got their food from a market system. Martin highlights that the fact that most people don't grow their own food these days means that the [[peasantry]] has been replaced by the [[proletariat]] as the most populous class, which Martin says must be a *positive* development for revolution.

Martin explains that Harvey seems to think that a revolution would cause all [[capital]] to cease flowing, with no system of economic life to replace it. 

## Capitalism: too big to fail?
> So this is, I think, a situation which I can really summarise in the following kind of way: that capital right now is too big to fail. We cannot imagine a situation where we would shut down the flow of capital, because if we shut down the flow of capital, _80 percent of the world's population would immediately starve, would be rendered immobile, would not be able to reproduce themselves in very effective ways_.
> \- Dave Harvey

Martin attributes this view to what he calls a "glaring example of the inability of academics to understand the creative power of the working class." Examining other past revolutions, Martin points to the many examples where the workers have taken over the management of the factories, and ensure the distribution of food and other essential goods. 

Quoting Harvey again, Martin demonstrates that Harvey believes that any rupture to the system of capitalism would cause all production to cease and the majority of the population to starve. Because of this, Martin believes that Harvey draws the incorrect conclusion that gradual reform is the only way forward.

In fact, Martin quotes Harvey as advocating *against* revolution, and saying that if anything, capitalism must be supported so that it does not fail: 

> And this means that capital in general is too big to fail. It is too dominant, and it is too necessary to us that we cannot allow it to fail. _We have to actually spend some time propping it_ up, trying to reorganise it, and maybe shift it around very slowly and over time to a different configuration. _But a revolutionary overthrow of this capitalist economic system is not anything that's conceivable at the present time. It will not happen, and it cannot happen, and we have to make sure that it does not happen_.
> \- Dave Harvey

Martin outlines how Harvey goes on to claim that we must "gently prod capitalism along" so that it "becomes less and less dependent upon profitability and becomes more and more organized so that it delivers the use values to the whole of the world's population..."

Martin lambasts Harvey for failing to learn anything about capitalism from his long study of Das Kapital, and acuses him of abandoning Marxism entirely.

## You cannot be an 'Academic Marxist' and still be a Marxist
Martin highlights the fact that Harvey seems unsure about what it means to be a Marxist, and only belatedly accepted the label after "citing Marx a few times favorably." 

Martin conclued by asserting that Marxism is not just an intellectual critique of capital, it is a revolutionary doctrine for overthrowing capitalism. He quotes [[Lenin]] in [[The State and Revolution (1917)]]:

> What is now happening to Marx’s theory has, in the course of history, happened repeatedly to the theories of revolutionary thinkers and leaders of oppressed classes fighting for emancipation. During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonise them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the ‘consolation’ of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarising it. Today, the bourgeoisie and the [[opportunism|opportunists]] within the labor movement concur in this doctoring of Marxism. They omit, obscure, or distort the revolutionary side of this theory, its revolutionary soul.

> Damn, that was a scathing takedown. Pretty undeniable too. I'm honestly shocked that Harvey would outright admit this level of revisionism and downright counter-revolutionary sentiments. Most [[reformism|reformists]] of this caliber understand that they must hide their ideas behind confusing phrases and buzzwords, but Harvey just straight up says he actually wants to prevent the overthrow of capitalism. I'm glad I never purchased anything by him, because I almost bought his companion guide to Das Kapital. I don't trust his perspective on much seeing as he can hold these reactionary views simultaneously.
