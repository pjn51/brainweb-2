The author begins by saying that eating lots of simple carbohydrates can give us a short-term energy boost, but leaves us hungry again very quickly. 

## Why do we crave sugar?
Fries cites a dietician as saying that sweetness is the first taste that humans prefer from birth, saying that this may indicate sugar craving is hardwired into us. She also notes that [[sugar]] also releases endorphins that calm and relax us.

Fries advises us that the issues begin when we over-consume sugary snacks. She explains that most Americans consume 22 teaspoons of added sugar daily, when the [[USA|American]] Heart Association recommends only 9 teaspoons daily for men.

## How to stop sugar cravings: 8 tips to use right now
1. Give in a little. Fries instructs us to eat a tiny bit of what we're craving, trying to stick to a 150 calorie threshold.
2. Combine foods. She says to combine a healthy food with an unhealthy one, such as dipping a banana in chocolate rather than just eating a chocolate bar. She argues that by doing this, we can get more of a long-term energy boost and satisfy our craving. 
3. Go cold turkey. Fries says that this may work for some people, but the first 72 hours are tough. 
4. Grab some gum. Fries posits that we could try chewing a stick of gum when sugar craving hits. 
5. Reach for fruit. She explains that we can get fiber and nutrients along with a little sugar. According to her, we could also reach for quick snacks like nuts and dried fruit so that we can substitute these for sweets. 
6. Get up and go. One idea from Fries is to take a short walk when cravings are intense. She says this change of scenery can help take our mind off the craving. 
7. Choose quality over quantity. She says we can choose a small, delicious bite rather than a whole bag of lower-quality snacks. 
8. Eat more regularly. She explains that we can keep our blood sugar more stable by eating every three to five hours, helping us to avoid irrational eating behavior.
