# Review
This is an excellent book, written by [[Rob Sewell]], about the tragedy of the German workers' movement during the turn of the century. It's a wild ride of near success and confused failure, culminating in the rise of fascism. This book is an excellent guide of how *not* to wage class war. The stupidity of the KPD and the Social Democrats is truly staggering, and it makes me thankful to not have lived through those events. It also puts the rise of fascism in clear context, and makes me more sure that the conditions needed for a fascist movement taking power are *not* present today.

# Introduction to the first edition
> The whole of Europe is filled with the spirit of revolution. There is a deep sense not only of discontent but of anger and revolt amongst the workmen against prewar conditions. The whole existing order in its political, social and economic aspects is questioned by the masses of the population from one end of Europe to the other.
> -- Lloyd George in a secret memorandum to the French Premier Clemenceau,  March 1919

Sewell says that the German Revolution of November 1918 had a huge effect on the course of international events. He says that it ended [[WW1]], gave an impetus to the revolutions developing across Europe, and further inspired the [[Russia|Russian]] [[proletariat]]. 

Sewell calls attention to the spontaneous celebrations of Russian workers upon hearing the news of the seizure of Berlin. He says that there were tens of thousands of cheering workers at demonstrations outside the Moscow Soviet.

Giving a broad overview of the German situation at the peak of the revolutionary fervor, Sewell says that red flags were flying over every ship in the German Navy, and armed workers controlled the streets of all the major cities in [[Germany]].

Sewell explains that the situation of the German state was so dire that during the peace negotiations (which were happening simultaneously), the Allies allowed the German state to keep a stockpile of 5,000 machine guns for the stated purpose of firing on German protestors.

Sewell now turns to the tragic end to this situation. He says that the armed workers handed the reigns over to the leaders of the [[SPD]], who in turn rescued German [[capitalism]]. Sewll asks why this happened, and I'm sure he intends to explain.

# 1. The rise of organized labor
Sewell gives us a broad sweeping overview of the immense size of the German workers' movement. He says that the SPD had been seen as the genuine cradle of [[Marxism]], with both [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] having spent a lot of time educating that party directly. He highlights some key details: the size of the party's membership (over a million), the number of full time workers (15,000), and the parliamentary vote of the party (4.3 million). 

Sewell contrasts the SPD with [[Bolsheviks]], saying that the former was incomparably stronger. However, Sewell says that unlike the Bolsheviks, the resources of the SPD were put towards the development of a labor bureaucracy, not the overthrow of capitalism.

Tying the development of the SPD with the economics of Europe, Sewell says that the relative social peace and economic upswing between 1871 and 1912 allowed the [[mass organizations]] of the working class to develop quickly, without much conflict. He says that this organic upswing of capitalism infected the leaders and officials of Social Democracy with the habit of compromise and a belief in gradual progress. 

Sewell says that this naturally engendered a belief in [[reformism]] within the party, and the belief that such reforms could be won indefinitely. He points out that the Marxist slogans, which these bureaucrats and careerists trotted out on select occasions, totally contradicted the fact that these leaders were adapting themselves to a cushy life under capitalism. In this way, Sewell claims that the mass organziations in Germany had transformed from a weapon in the hands of the workers to a force that mediated disputes between the classes. 

## 1.1. Marxism revised?
Sewell turns his attention to [[Bernstein]]. He says that this prominent thinker began to call for a revision of Marxism in the 1890s. Sewell claims that Bernstein believed capitalism had fundamentally changed - overcoming its contadictions of boom and slump, and that the blurring of class lines had begun. 

Sewell says that the [[reformism]] and [[opportunism]] of Bernstein can be seen in his phrase: "The final goal, no matter what it is, is nothing; the movement is everything." Sewell ties Bernstein to later reformists, saying that thinkers who claim that Marxism must be updated are merely rehasing Bernstein's tired arguments.

However, Sewell tells us that there was oppositon within the SPD to these ideas. He says that [[Kautsky]] and other leaders took up the fight to "defend their Marxist heritage," as those thinkers framed it. But Sewll cautions us not to take Kautsky for a genune Marxist. He says that Kautsky defended the tenets of Marxism as a [[religion|religious]] zealot defends the scripture. We are told that Kautsky's understanding of Marxism had become totally static. Sewell calls Kautsky a typical centrist - Marxist in words and phrases but reformist in deeds. 

Despite the outcry against the revisionism of Bernstein, Sewell says this kind of thing was happening all over the place. He says that even the thinkers who claimed to be anti-revisionist were furiously revising to suit their needs as well-paid mediators between the capitalists and the workers. 

Sewell explains that the degenration of the SPD's leadership was difficult for many to spot. He says that [[Lenin]] considered himself a Kautskyite, and that the only thinker to cut through Kautsky's bullshit was [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. 

On the eve of the war, Sewell says that the [[Second International]] made bold proclamations that it would never fracture over a bourgeois conflict, and that it would put a stop to any war through a general strike. However, he explains that the war utterly fractured the International along national lines.

Explaining the causes for the war, Sewell says that [[imperialism]] had reached an impasse, where the productive forces had outgrown the bounds of the nation state and private ownership. Since German capitalism had developed too late to get a hold of colonies like the [[UK]] or [[France]], the only way to resolve this contradiction, Sewell says, was a war. 

Sewell highlights that in total betrayal of the socialist cause, the SPD chairperson in the Reichstag read the following statement:

> We are faced with the iron fact of war. We are threatened with the horrors of hostile invasions...
> It is for us to ward off this danger and to safeguard the culture and independence of our country. This we honor twhat we have always pledged: in the hour of danger, we shall not desert our Fatherland... Guided by these principles, we shall vote for the war credits.

Sewell calls the SPD out for using quotations from Marx and Engels taken out of context. 

## 1.2. Internationalists at war
Sewell tells us the position that internationalists had during the first world war. He says that the true Marxists were reduced to small handfuls in their respective countries. He says that at the Zimmerwald confrence in 1915, they joked that all the world's internationalists could fit into two stage-coaches. Lenin, [[Trotsky]], [[Liebknecht]], Luxemburg, and [[Connolly]] were the leaders of their small groupings across Europe and Russia.

Sewell gives us a short introduction to the work of Liebknecht and Luxemburg. He says that Liebknecht was a SPD deputy in the Reichstag, the only one to initially vote against the war credits, and that a small group began to form around him and Rosa. Sewell says that this group voted to start the publication of a secret paper, called *Spartacus,* and were referred to as [[Spartacists]]. 

Sewell explains how a broader opposition to the war soon developed within the SPD. He says that many SPD deputies began to turn against the central party leadership, and that tens of thousands of workers began to demonstrate against the war and against the government. Because of this, Sewell says, Liebknecht and Rosa were arrested and imprisoned along with hundreds of Spartacist workers. 

## 1.3. Birth of the USPD
Sewell said that a split was developing within the SPD over the war. He says that in 1916, a big minority refused to approve the state budget and as a result of this disobedience 120,000 members were expelled from the SPD and formed the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany, or the USPD. 

Sewell highlights the heterogenous makeup of this party. He says that there were Marxists and revisionists competing for influence, including the Spartacists, who considered themselves an autonomous group within the party. Sewell categorizes the USPD as a classical centrist party, wavering between Marxism and reformism.

Citing Trotsky's definition of centrism, Sewell says that centrism arises as a stage in the process of the transformation of the mass oganizations from inert groups to a revolutionary force. For Sewell, the key factor is the direction that the mass organization is developing in - if it is moving towards an existance as a revolutionary force, or if it is reverting to a classically reformist organization. Sewell says that the USPD was developing towards a revolutionary standpoint.

All while this was happening, Sewell calls attention to the dire conditions caused by WW1. He says that adult rations were severely limited in Germany, and every winter thousands of children were dying of frostbite as a result of coal shortages.

## 1.4. The Russian Revolution
Sewell gives us an account of the sweeping global effects of the October Revolution in Russia. He says that the Soviet declaration of an intent to end the war electrified the workers across Europe, and so did their revealing of the secret agreements between the world powers. 

Sewell highlights all the mutinies that happend in the wake of the revolution. He says that there was a mutiny 45 divisions of the French army and over half of the Austro-Hungarian navy. He also calls attention to the strike wave that followed 1917, including 250,000 workers in Paris, 700,000 workers in Austria-Hungary, and well over a million British workers. 

In Germany, Sewell says that over a million workers struck against the war. 

# 2. In the throes of revolution
Sewell outlines the measures that the German state was forced to take in an effort to stem the tides of revolution. He says that a new government was formed with the Social Democrat [[Scheidemann]] in its ranks, and that the state gave amnesty to political prisoners. Sewell says that this freed Liebknecht, but Rosa was still held under 'protective custody.'

However, Sewell tells us, these reforms were too little, too late. He says that the German fleet was meant to sail for a final battle with the British Navy, but the sailors on board mutinied, disarming the officers. Sewell describes how as the fleet turned around and headed back to German ports, workers in the streets celebrated. 

Sewell cites a Spartacist who describes the scene as the mutineers returned to their ports and massed in the city center:

>I felt then, and later, that the sight of armed workers sets off a roar in the blood of those who sympathise with the marchers. Singing hoarsely was a sprawling band of demonstrating convicts freed by a truckload of sailors from Oslebshausen prison most of them wore soldiers grey coats over their prison garb. But the true symbol of this revolution, which is really nought but a revolt, were neither the armed workers nor the singing convicts - but the mutineers from the fleet with their reversed headbands and carbines slung over their shoulders, butts up and barrels down...
> "At the foot of the Roland statue a frightened old woman crouched. 'Ach du liebe Gott', she wailed piercingly 'what is all this? What is the world coming to?'A huge-framed young worker who gave intermittent bellows of triumph and whom I had followed from the Brill, grasped the old woman's shoulders. He laughed resoundingly. 'Revolution', he rumbled. 'Revolution, Madam.'"

Sewell illustrates the spread of the fires of revolution outward from this naval mutiny on November 3rd. He says by November 9th, workers' and soldiers' councils controlled the major urban centers all across Germany, including Berlin, which had been the central command for the German military itself. 

Sewell outlines how as some thinkers of the SDP had moved to the left and joined the USDP, a new layer had emerged that was even more contemptuous of the workers. He says that these figures included Noske, Ebert, and Scheidemann. The latter, according the Sewell, directly told the Kaiser that the Social Democrats were doing all in their power to restrain the workers, begging for more reforms in order to defend the state and class society.

## 2.1. 'I hate revolution like sin'
Sewell outlines the desperate position of the state and its defenders. He says that Noske attempted in vain to put down the naval revolt, while Ebert plotted with the head of the government, Prince Max von Baden. The author says that these two figures were trying to get the Kaiser to step down in order to avert revolution. 

However, Sewell explains that the Kaiser was totally disconnected from reality. He says the Kaiser wanted to hang on to power at all costs, saying that he would rather order the German military to attack the people with flamethrowers rather than abdicate. However, the author reminds us that the Kaiser had no military to speak of at this point. 

Sewell says that Prince Max declared that the Kaiser had agreed to abdicate, despite this being totally false. However, he says that this was not enough, and that workers and soldiers had already begun to form councils which would really decide the fate of the country. 

Sewell compares what was happening now with the Russian experience of revolution. In both cases, Sewell claims, the masses were making their own decisions for once. However, Sewell claims that they were still loyal to the party that they had toiled to create - no matter the treachery that the party's leaders had inflicted. He continues, saying that the USPD would play an important but secondary role. 

## 2.2. Long live the revolution!
Sewell explains that the armed demonstrations that were convulsing Berlin now directly threatened state rule. In response to this, he says that Prince Max felt forced to make additional concessions: 

> The revolution is on the verge of winning. We cannot crush it but perhaps we can strangle it...if Ebert is presented to me from the streets as the people's leader, then we will have a republic; if it is Liebknecht, then Bolshevism. But if the abdicating Kaiser appoints Ebert as Reich Chancellor, then there is still a little hope for the monarchy. Perhaps it will be possible to divert the revolutionary energies into the legal channels of an election campaign.

The author outlines how a short time later, Scheidemann was eating lunch in the Reichstag, when he heard loud cries from a crowd outside. Spontaneously, Sewell tells us, the politician ran to the balcony and announced that Ebert was now Chancellor, and proclaimed the creation of a German Republic. 

Sewell tells us of Eberts shock at the news. He says that Ebert was furious that Scheidemann had proclaimed a republic, but accepted the position in order to divert the anger of the masses. 

Throughout this time, Sewell says that the dealings of the Reichstag was a sideshow in light of the proletarian organs of power that now really controlled society. And it was this group, Sewell explains, that acted to form a real center of power in the form of an executive committee.

Sewell explains that this committee was formed of three SPD members (Ebert, Scheidemann, and Landsberg) and three USPD members (Haase, Dittmann, and Barth). He elaborates that although their power derived from the workers and soldiers, they soon came to an accomodation with the German High Command.

## 2.3. What kind of democracy?
Sewell contrasts the goals of the Spartacists, who he says called for a national congress of soldiers' and workers' councils as a basis for the creation of a workers' state, and the goals of the SPD leaders, who he claims were seeking something like the Constituent Assembly in the Russian revolution. 

Seeing the potential for the latter course, Sewell explains how the bourgeoisie threw their weight behind calls for a constituent assembly in order to channel the anger of the masses into a legal route. 

Unfortunately for the German revolution, Sewell claims, the spartacists took an [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] attitude towards the convening of a national assembly. He says many Germans supported the idea of an assembly. 

He contrasts the behavior of the spartacists with the Bolsheviks. He says that the latter put forward the demand of a revolutionary constituent assembly in their program. Sewell says this was because the workers and peasants had "profound democratic aspirations" in their calls for an assembly, and the Bolsheviks understood that given the right balance of forces, an assembly could be a positive thing. 

Furthermore, Sewell says, the Bolsheviks still put forward the demand for a constituent assembly after the establishment of the Soviets in 1917, and this did not in any way prevent them from moving past the demand for the assembly when Soviet power was ready to supercede it. 

Sewell says that while Kautsky argued that the workers' councils ought to be combined with the bourgeois state, Lenin was strongly rebuking this concept. The author argues that Kautsky was forgetting the fundamentally different class interest of the bourgeois state and the proletarian councils. 

Sewell explains that the Spartacists denounced any and all calls for a contituent assembly, saying (correctly in his mind) that the workers' councils were the truly revolutionary force. However, Sewell argues that this ignored the fact that broad layers of the working class still had illusions in the prospect of an assembly, and that the Spartacists shouldn't have written off any possibility of struggle around the idea of an assembly. 

Sewell also tells us that the Spartacists denounced the leaders of both the SPD and the USPD as agents of the bourgeois, posing their differences in a simplistic way that served only to isolate them from the working class. 

## 2.4. The Bolsheviks and the constituent assembly
Sewell outlines Lenin's stated position on the German constituent assembly in 1918: he thought that it was perfectly reasonable for that demand to exist as part of a revolutionary program. 

Sewell returns to Lenin's constant reminder that it's one thing to have a worked out political perspective on everything, and quite another to apply that perspective to events. 

Comparing the situation in Germany with Russia in February 1917, Sewell says that in both cases power was in the hands of the workers and peasants, but those groups were unaware of this fact and passed power over to the compromisers, who in turn handed it back to the bourgeoisie. 

Sewell quotes Lenin and his work, [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]] extensively to show that the Spartacists weren't taking the [[class consciousness]] of the working class into account when they denounced calls for a constituent assembly. 

> The ultra-left or sectarian simply shouts from the sidelines whereas the genuine Marxist would participate in the struggle of the workers with all their illusions, constantly attempting to raise their level of consciousness at each stage in the development of the struggle.

Sewell says that despite the [[KPD]] boycott, 83% of the population voted, showing that the KPD was out of touch with the workers. I'm not sure where the Spartacists end and the KPD begins at this point. 

Sewell quotes Lenin's disapproval of the slogan "down with the government!" when there is not a sufficiently prepared proletarian force capable of actually taking power. Sewell says that the Spartacists were also using this slogan even when they only had 3,000 members. 

Sewell says that the Bolsheviks always fought against any temptation towards [[Blanquism]], reaffirming that their main task was to win a majority to their side via patient explanation and not by ultra-left rrradicalism. 

Sewell outlines the position of the Spartacists, who had now officially changed their name from the Internationale Group to the Spartacist League. He says they had opened negotiations with the USPD, but had a very limited following in the councils, and their supporters were mainly confined to two cities with no members on the Berlin council executive. 

Sewell says that towards the end of November, the German military attempted a coup in Berlin. He says that soldiers marched into the city with the approval of the SPD leader Ebert. Sewell explains that the soldiers raided the Spartacist newspaper, clashed with demonstrators at a Spartacist rally, and arrested the executives on the Berlin workers' council. 

However, Sewell says that the masses were also ready to fight. He says that spontaneously, a crowd marched on the soldiers, freed the executives, and foiled the coup attempt. 

Sewell critiques the SPD for playing down the event and saying that the Spartacists were being provokative. He goes on to say that the Spartacists seized the opportunity, rallying the masses and telling them to throw the SPD leaders out of power as more German troops arrived.

However, Sewell informs us that the German troops began to fraternize with the workers and the ruling class was forced to bide its time. 

Meanwhile, the author describes the national congress of the workers' and soldiers' councils that was held in December 1918. He says that due to lopsided rules for delegate election, there were a lot of full-time party workers as delegates, and not so many workers. Sewell attributes the fact that the congress overwhelmingly supported the constituent assembly to this fact. 

Sewell explains that while the congress had voted for the constituent assembly, it was far from a conservative affair. He highlights that the congress also demanded that the standing army be abolished, and that all key industries be nationalized. 

Sewell describes the murderous mood that the rightwing SPD leaders, in alliance with the monarchists and counter-revolutionaries, were creating. He says that their goal was to rile the people up to kill the Spartacists, who they saw as the only real threat to class society. 

## 2.5. Founding of the Communist Party
Sewell describes how the Spartacist League felt pressured by the October revolution in Russia to transform itself into a more centralized communist party. In December 1918, Sewell outlines how the Spartacists founded the Communist Party of Germany ([[KPD]]). 

Sewell claims that the KPD were saturated with ultraleft tendencies, as evidenced by their vote 62 to 23 to boycott the upcoming National Assembly elections in January 1919. He also says that some tried to pass resolutions banning trade union membership of Communist Party members. Sewell claims that the KPD thought that it was their duty to struggle *against* the trade unions due to their rightwing leadership. 

Sewell says that the KPD didn't recognize the fact that the masses were turning towards, not away, from the trade unions. Sewell cites figures stating that millions of workers were joining unions at this time.

# 3. Counter-revolution raises its head
Sewell outlines the common process that occurs when the advanced workers feel the gains of the revolutionary wave slipping from their fingers and become impatient in their desire to regain momentum. 

He compares the German situation in December 1918 and January 1919 to the July Days of the Russian revolution. He notes Lenin's attitude to the workers holding armed demonstrations, which he says was an attitude of caution. 

However, Sewell says that the Bolsheviks didn't stand apart from the movement, and instead led the demonstrations to ensure a peaceful result and made sure that the workers would restrain themselves for the time being. 

Sewell says that we can see parallels in the [[Spain|Spanish revolution]] during May 1937 in Barcelona. He points out that when Stalinist forces seized the Barcelona telegraph from the anarchists, it sparked a clash between the workers and the Republican government and ended with the supression of the [[POUM]]. 

## 3.1. The 'Spartacist Uprising'
Sewell explains the atmosphere in Berlin in January 1919. He says that the right wing propaganda campaign against the Spartacists was in full swing, while rumors of a coup were circulating. He also mentions how the three USPD ministers had resigned from the government in protest. 

Sewell cites the testimony of General Groener in 1925, who describes the events that unfolded preceding the uprising. He says that Ebert and Noske had summoned the troops and were planning on marching against the Spartacists. But in order to do this, he explains, they needed to provoke the Spartacists to early action. He says they planned to do this by forcing a member of the USPD, Emil Eichhorn (the police president of Berlin) to resign under false charges.

Sewell continues, saying that Eichhorn had been organizing a workers' police force, and refused to cede his position under the charges. He says that the USPD and the Revolutionary Shop Stewards met with the KPD to discuss joint action, and they called for a mass demonstration on January 5th. He says they formed a Revolutionary Committee to manage the action.

Upon hearing that they had military support from the Berlin garrison and a few other cities, the Committee decided to use the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators as an opportunity to overthrow the Ebert-Noske-Scheidemann government. 

Sewell gives an overview of the actions that the Committee took with the help of the masses. He says they occupied the SPD offices, printing presses, and instigated a strike wave where 500,000 workers took to the streets. 

Sewell says that the Committee was meeting daily, but didn't have any clear goal or strategy. Meanwhile, he explains the position of the KPD. Sewell says that the KPD oficially said that the overthrow of the government at the present moment would be a pure adventure due to the state of the movement in the rest of the country, but the KPD paper was full of proclamations calling the workers to take action now. 

Sewell faults the two KPD members on the Revolutionary Committee for backing an insurrection without the permission of the KPD. Sewell calls Liebknecht a "man of action," who was supporting insurrection as a gut reaction without thinking clearly. 

As the forces of counter-revolution prepared, Sewell says the Revolutionary Committee argued back and forth while the mass movement dissapated.

## 3.2. The white terror
Sewell explains that the forces of counter-revolution had no such issues deciding on a course of action. He says that on January 10th, the Freikorps attacked the workers, and the next day, Noske moved in with a contingent of troops led by monarchist officers. 

Using artillery and heavy weapons, Sewell describes the way in which the government took back the SPD offices and killed many people. 

Sewell says that the press whipped up a storm of anti-Spartacist propaganda, and put bounties on the heads of Luxemburg and Liebknecht. He says that these two leaders were found and arrested on January 15th and executed, with Liebknecht shot while supposedly attempting to escape, and Luxemburg beaten to death and thrown in the Landwehr Canal. 

Turning to a theoretical analysis, Sewell says that [[sectarianism|sectarians]] have drawn totally false conclusions from the failure of the uprising. Sewell explains that a mass revolutionary party along the lines of the Bolsheviks could have made a difference, but the real question is how to build such a party. 

Sewell quotes Chris Harman, who says that Rosa's tactical error was that she should have broken with the SPD much earlier. Sewell criticizes this analysis, and says that it repudiates the whole experience of Bolshevism. Instead, he claims that Luxemburg should have focused on creating a well-organized and homogenous tendency within the SPD much earlier. Sewell claims that Luxemburg underestimated the importance of organization. 

Sewell says that Harman misunderstands the history of Bolshevism within the [[RSDLP]]. He says that it wasn't until 1912 that the Bolsheviks formed their own independent party, after decades of working within the RSDLP. 

Explaining the historical patterns that we can see, Sewell points out that when mass communist parties were formed, such as in Germany, [[France]], and [[Italy]], they emerged from massive splits in the existing social democracy, not from tiny groupings or sects. 

Sewell cites Lenin's insistence that the British Communist Party affiliate with the [[Labour Party (UK)]]. Sewell claims this was because Lenin never wanted the forces of Marxism to be isolated from the broader movement, even as he fought agains the ideas of reformism and revisionism that were often present in that movement. 

Turning back to the history, Sewell says that after the uprising was put down, the National Assembly elections were held. He says that the KPD boycotted these, and claims that was a bad move. He explains that the SPD did much better than the USPD, and that the two [[workers' party|workers' parties]], which theoretically stood for [[socialism]], polled 45% of all votes cast, and that the right wing bourgeois parties only got 15%. 

Sewell explains how the right wing was emboldened by the defeat of the Spartacist uprising. He outlines how in town after town throughout central Germany, the Freikorps and other loyalist divisions overthrew the workers' and soldiers' councils in bloody rounds of street fighting where thousands were killed. 

The author elaborates that the Freikorps were formed in December 1918, led by reactionary upper-class officers, and filled with proto-[[fascism|fascist]] veterans of [[WW1]]. 

Meanwhile in Berlin, Sewell describes a rapidly shifting balance of forces. He says that in the workers council that was once dominated by the SPD, the USPD and the KPD were now in the majority when they met in February 1919 to discuss solidarity actions with the workers in central Germany. 

Sewell describes how the council passed new resolutions, and backed them up with a general strike that 90% of the delegates approved of. Within 24 hours, we are told that a massive strike gripped the city. 

Describing the battle that ensued between the workers and the Freikorps, Sewell says that barricades were erected, and the SPD government gave Nosk dictatorial powers over Berlin. He says that Noske ordered 30,000 Freikorps troops to invade the city, and ordered the troops to shoot any armed worker on the spot. 

Having gotten cold feet, Sewell says that the workers council called off the strike on March 9th, but this didn't stop the wave of assassinations carried out by the Freikorps. Sewell says that on March 10th 1919, the chairman of the KPD was murdered in police custody. 

## 3.3. The Bavarian Republic
Sewell says that Bavaria had been the first state to overthrow the monarch, and carried on that revolutionary tradition by proclaiming the Bavarian Republic on November 7th, 1918, led by Kurt Eisner (USPD member recently released from jail).

Anyways, Sewell says that Eisner got assassinated in February 1919, sparking turmoil throughout the region. He describes how the situation devolved into anarchy, and the economic conditions plummeted. Upon hearing of the establishment of a soviet republic in [[Hungary]], the author says that a leader of the USPD proposed a similar thing in Munich. 

Sewell describes the comic inability of this government to rule (the KPD refused to enter it), and says that it collapsed within six days. 

By that time, Sewell says the forces of counter-revolution were striking back in Munich, but the workers in the streets foiled the first coup attempt. He says that the workers were moved to the left by the attempted coup, and demanded that power be handed to the KPD. However, he says the KPD was reluctant to take power, and only did so after feeling the pressure from below.

Once the KPD took power, Sewell salutes them for their willingness to take a stand in dire conditions. He says that on April 7th, a new soviet republic was declared in Munich. He claims that the leader of the KPD, Levine, understood the only way forward was for the revolution to spread to the other cities in Germany. 

Sewell describes the factors that could inspire optimism in the situation. He outlines the establishment of a soviet republic in Hungary, powerful workers' councils in Austria, and a state of emergency in Stuttgart. He also highlights the establishment of the [[Comintern]] a few weeks earlier. 

Unfortunatley, the tale that Sewell describes isn't so cheery. He says that the SPD troops encircled the city, and were backed up by 30,000 of Noske's Freikorps. By May 1st, Sewell says that the city had been taken by the forces of reaction, with the last Communist declaration reading: "Don't make the hangman's task easy. Sell your lives dearly." 

Sewell says that over 1,000 workers were killed. He says that Levine, faced with execution, said... 

>I have known for a long time that we Communists are but dead men on leave. It is up to you, gentlemen, to decide whether my ticket of leave will once more be extended or whether I must join Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. You may kill me - my ideas will live on.

# 4. The Kapp putsch
Sewell says that once the workers' councils began to dissolve, the bourgeoise decided to try and get rid of the Noske-Sheidemann-Ebert government by force. 

Describing the March 1920 arrival of Wolfgang Kapp, the founder of a right wing party in Berlin, Sewell says that this coup attempt was backed by 12,000 rightwing soldiers. He adds that Noske attempted to call upon the Reichswehr officers to defend the SPD government, but the officers refused and the head of the army announced he was going on leave. In order to escape capture, Seweell explains, the government fled from Berlin to Stuttgart. 

Sewell says that in response to this, the SPD were forced to call upon the workers to defend them, and the workers did - calling a general strike that paralyzed Berlin, preventing Kapp from even being able to issue the decree that he had taken power!

Turning to the KPD, Sewell criticizes them for what he deems an ultraleft stance on the matter. Sewell claims that the KPD position was that workers should be neutral, since this was a fight "between two counter-revolutionary wings." Sewell notes that within 24 hours of saying this, the KPD were forced to reverse course due to the determination of the German workers to defeat the putsch.

Explaining the strength of the German working class, Sewell outlines how the workers began to form strike committees, and even create a 50,000-strong Red Army out of armed detachments of workers that were able to force the German military to flee from multiple cities across Germany.

Sewell compares these actions with the spontaneous actions of the proletariat in [[Spain]], in protest against Franco. He says that given a revolutionary leadership, the workers in both situations could have easily taken power.

Sewell claims that Lenin compared the situation surrounding the Kapp putsch with the [[Kornilov]] affair in August 1917. 

## 4.1. A swing to the left
Discussing the consequences of the failed putsch, Sewell says that the USPD grew in size to the second largest party, with 800,000 members and a voting base of almost 5 million. He also cites the collapse of the SPD in the center and the growth of the far right as evidence of growing polarization.

Sewell describes the efforts that the new ruling coalition under SPD member Hermann Mueller took to restore order, with hundreds executed across Germany.

## 4.2. Towards a mass Communist International
Sewell says that the year 1920 was a turning point for the KPD and the [[Comintern]]. He continues, saying that the success of the Bolsheviks was causing wide layers of the social democratic movement to press their leaders to join the Communist International. 

Sewell highlights that the opportunity existed to create a mass ComIntern, but this was paired with the risk of bringing reformist and opportunist elements into the organization. Therefore, Sewell argues, the ComIntern stipulated 21 conditions for membership, meant to weed out opportunists.

Turning to the KPD, Sewell explains that the party had grown from 4,000 to 78,000 strong in one year. However, Sewell cautions that this was still tiny relative to the SPD, which had a million members by this point.

In the USPD, Sewell describes, a turn to the left was happening. He says that in March 1919, the USPD had come out in favor of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and soviet power. After the USPD affiliated with the ComIntern, Sewell explains that negotiations began to merge the KPD and USPD into a united German Communist Party that would have over half a million members. 

In December 1920, Sewell says, the French Socialist Party affiliated with the ComIntern, adding 140,000 members to the latter's ranks. Sewell describes similar events in Czechoslovakia and Italy.

Sewell generalizes these events to claim that they demonstrate that mass parties don't emerge from small sectarian groups on the fringes of the movement, but instead arise from the traditional mass organizations of the working class. He argues that workers tend to learn from experience, and tend to take the line of least resistance, preferring to act through their traditional organizations instead of abandoning them at the first friction.
Sewell says that by the ComIntern's second congress in 1920, they understood that a serious organizational and political preparation was needed in order to secure victories in Western Europe. 

## 4.3. Lenin's struggle against ultra-leftism
Sewell begins by explaining that the ultraleft turn within the newly formed Communist parties was partly due to a reaction against the opportunism of the old reformist leaderships, and partially due to inpatience in a revolutionary period. He calls this tendency an "attempt to find a short-cut to success."

Sewell outlines how Lenin's masterpiece, [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]], was written to combat this tendency. Sewell argues that Lenin viewed [[ultraleftism]] as a necessary stage that the movement had to precede through, and says Lenin urged the leaderships of the Communist parties to innoculate themselves against this disorder.

Returning to Germany, Sewell tells us that after the unification of the new Communist Party, a central committee was elected under Daeumig and Levi, who had been close friends of Luxemburg. Eventually, Sewell elaborates, Levi resigned and was replaced by Brandler, Meyer, Froelich, and Thalheimer in the leadership.

Sewell says that the ComIntern sent Bela Kun, a prominent leader of the struggle in [[Hungary]], to help the German communists. However, Sewell argues, Bela Kun was infected with ultraleft ideas and had made many mistakes as leader of the Hungarian Communist Party. Sewell claims this ultraleft tendency was further fueled by [[Zinoviev]], [[Bukharin]], and [[Radek]], who "poured scorn on the defensive struggles of the SPD organizations."

## 4.4. The 'March Offensive'
Sewell claims that the new leadership of the KPD, "egged on by the ComIntern," were looking impatiently for a final confronation with German capitalism. He says that this led to the formulation of a new offensive theory - that the vanguard workers in the KPD could 'electrify' the rest of the proletariat if the vanguard took decisive action. To me, this seems similar to the [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] idea of "propoganda of the deed."

Sewell explains that the sitation in Germany was incredibly tense in March 1920, after [[France]] occupied Dusseldorf due to a failure to pay reparations. In addition, Sewell adds, the miners in central Germany were under police control due to a strike wave. 

In this contex, Sewell says, the KPD decided to launch an offensive in support of the miners. In fact, the author tells us that the events moved to an armed uprising led by the KPD, who called on the rest of the German workers to rise up as well. However, the author says, the KPD had misjudged the mood of the masses and the revolt remained isolated. 

The author adds that a KPD leader, Eberlein, even wanted to stage false-flag attacks on the KPD and workers' organizations in central Germany in order to provoke the masses to action. Sewell remarks that fortunately, nothing came of these plans. 

When it was all over, Sewell explains, the infamous 'March Action' resulted in thousands of arrests and hundreds of deaths at the hands of the state. Sewell adds that over 200,000 members actually left the KPD as a result of the misstep. 

Sewell quotes Lenin's dismay at the ultraleft turn, who said that "The theses of Thaelheimer and Bela Kun are radically false..."

## 4.5. The united front policy
Sewell outlines how at the Third Congress of the Comintern in June 1921, both Lenin and Trotsky conducted a battle against the offensive theory of the KPD in March. He says that the Congress recognized that the struggle had lessened in intensity, necessitating a return to a United Front policy. 

By this, Sewell puts forward, the Comintern meant that communists should work towards fighting alongside reformist organizations in day-to-day struggles, connecting themselves with the workers who were loyal to these reformist organizations. 

Sewell highlights that this did *not* mean abandoning or watering down revolutionary positions, and instead meant uniting the working class in action against a common enemy. He says that in essence, a united front policy means to "march seperately under your own banners, but strike together." 

As a result of this directive, Sewell says, the KPD's slogan became "Towards the Masses!" and their reach improved among the working class. Sewell cites the "ultra-left" Ruth Fischer, who said that in the third quarter of 1922 the KPD had 218,000 members, up from the 180,000 that it had just after the March Action.

In June 1922, Sewell explains, the German foreign minister was murdered by a rightwing paramiltiary organization. He says that this led to revulsion among the workers, who moved towards action. He adds that the KPD took excellent advantage of this situation, organizing demonstrations. However, the author says, this demonstration of militancy caused the SPD to break off relations with the KPD. 

**Table: Political murders committed between 1919 and 1922**

|                                | Right    | Left  |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ----- |
| Number of political murders    | 354      | 22    |
| Number of sentences for murder | 24       | 38    |
| Avg length prison              | 4 months | 15 yr | 

At this time, Sewell informs us, inflation really took off. He says that in June 1922 the exchange rate was 300 marks --> one dollar, but by January 1923 it was 18,000 marks --> one dollar. 

Sewell outlies how facing this, the German capitalists became determined to reverse all the concessions that the workers had gained in the previous period. He says that the industrialist Fritz Thyssen penned an open letter saying "Germany's salvation can only come from a return to the 10-hour working day."

# 5. The crisis of 1923
Sewell gives an outline of the price Germany paid for losing [[WW1]]. Their colonies were divided, Germany's economy was crushed under reparation payments, and the Saar mines and Alsace-Lorraine were transferred outright to [[France]], along with its three-quarters of German iron production and 2 million people. 

Sewell notes that the payments Germany was to make were crushing in size, and totally humiliated and stripped the country. However, the German bourgeoisie were able to make enormous profits due to the rampant inflation while the rest of the population faced starvation.

## 5.1. The French occupy the Ruhr
Sewell explains that Germany had no choice but to default on reparations payments in January 1923. This led to France sending 60,000 troops to occupy the Ruhr industrial heartland, where 80% of steel production and 71% of coal production were situated. 

The author says that this led to a wave of anger throughout Germany. Over half a million people demonstrated in Berlin alone and the government, facing pressure from below, instructed Ruhr workers to engage in a camoaign of "passive resistance" in the workplaces. 

This was happening, Sewell continues, in the midst of hyper-inflation. Industrialists like Thyssen, Krupp, and Stinnes were purchasing vast empires of firms on credit, and then repaying the loans with worthless paper money. At the same time, a loaf of bread that had cost less than one mark in 1918, now cost 201,000 marks by 1923. 

Sewell elaborates that those on fixed incomes literally starved, while the petty bourgeoisie were panicked and looking to the labor movement for a way out of the situation. An intense class struggle developed out of the anger at French occupation, with tens of thousands of workers literally fighting the occupying French troops. 

In May of 1923, Sewell tells us, a strike wave swept Germany and workers called for the overthrow of the Cuno government. The KPD was becoming the reference point for the workers and all the conditions for revolution were once again arriving. 

However, Sewell counters, the KPD was totally out of step with events. Radek, in May, said that they were in no position to establish a proletarian dictatorship due to a supposed lack of revolutionary will among the workers. 

By August 1923, prices were doubling every few hours, according to Sewell. A strike wave precipitated a general strike that swept the country and ended up being the largest and most intense in Germany's history, especially given that no central organization ordered it to begin. This movement caused the Cuno government to resign. 

On the heels of this resignation, Sewell tells us, the KPD leadership were summoned to Moscow to discuss the situation in Germany. However, the party's leading theorist, Thaelheimer, was talking of "a long road."

## 5.2. Preparing for insurrection 
Sewell outlines the urging that was given to the KPD leaders. Trotsky pushed them to set a date for the insurrection, but was refused. The KPD had been setting up a military organization which was further strengthened by Russian experts, and 100,000 workers had been organized into armed defense groups called the Proletarian Hundreds.

Meanwhile, Sewell reminds us, the "passive resistance" in the Ruhr was becoming too expensive for the German bourgeoisie to bear. The new German government under Stresemann ordered it to an end. 

Sewell tells us that the KPD laid plans to enter the left-leaning Social Democratic governments of Saxony and Thuringa, which were under threat from the central government. They were planning to use any action against these local governments as an excuse for a revolutionary offensive. They also laid the foundations for a general strike and insurrection. 

As the crisis intensified, Sewell explains, the German military gave the Proletarian Hundreds an ultimatum: give up your weapons within three days or face attack. The ultimatum was ignored, and in October, German troops entered Saxony and the KPD leaders alerted the party to begin the early stages of the insurrection. 

Tragically, the author says, the Chemnitz trade union conference that was meant to be the springboard of the insurrection, contained Social Democratic delegates that were hopelessly out of touch. When Brandler, the leading KPD delegate, put forward the case for a general strike, a Social Democratic delegate threatened that if such a policy was put to a vote, the Social Democratic delegates would walk out. This stand cowed, Brandler, who withdrew his proposal. 

Within a few days, Sewell continues, the German military were able to remove the leader of the local government in Saxony with no resistance. 

## 5. 3. The Hamburg rising
After the Chemnitz conference, Sewell says, KPD agents were sent throughout the country to inform local branches of the decision to cancel the uprising. However, the one sent to Hamburg arrived too late and the plans were already being carried out. 

After the isolated insurrection was crushed, Sewell says, the KPD scapegoated Brandler and removed him from his post. However, much later, the personal role of Stalin was revealed in a letter to Zinoviev and Bukharin. Stalin wrote that "the Germans must be curbed, and not spurred on."

Sewell argues that the KPD, in an effort to avoid the ultraleft mistakes of the past, bent the stick too far towards delaying their attack and holding back. Zinoviev, Stalin, and the other leaders twisted events to say that they had "over-estimated" the situation in 1923, rather than under-estimating it. 

## 5.4. The lessons of October
Sewell highlights Trotsky's role in spelling out the lessons of this defeat, while the other leaders were covering it up. He emphasized the importance of showing the KPD that they were in a period of preparation for the seizure of power. He called for the consolidation of the cadres, develop factory cells, and infiltrate the ranks of the army. 

Sewell says that Trotsky believed that the KPD were reluctant to organize a revolution since they had burned their fingers in the March events. 

# 6. Stabilization
Sewell argues that the defeat of the KPD provided the basis for a period of stabilization of capitalism. Within the USSR, the events demoralized the Russian masses, making it easier for the bureaucracy to shape events. 

The author says that the death of Lenin in 1924 further demoralized the Russian workers and sharpened the struggle between Stalin (along with his allies Kamenev and Zinoviev), and Trotsky, who had formed the Left Opposition. 

It was during this time, Sewell continues, that Stalin brought forward his "anti-Bolshevik" theory of "socialism in one country." This represented the bureaucracy's desire for a stable, safe existence. 

Back in Germany, Sewell says, the KPD had been banned, the eight hour workday abolished, and the government was on a path of economic recovery. This path was enabled due to the introduction of a new [[currency]], the Reutenmark. 

Sensing the danger of revolution in Europe, Sewell outlines how the [[USA|American]] state pressured the other sections of the bourgeoisie to ease the bleeding of the German economy. Instead, the Dawes Plan saw the withdrawl of French troops and the introduction of massive loans to the German bourgeoise. 

Sewell labels these methods as proto-[[Keynesianism]] and says they rejuvinated the German economy for a time. This was a period of "borrowed prosperity" where debt held by the German state rose to 50% of national income, but inflation fell and the economy stabilized. 

Sewell underlines the increase in industrial disputes as the economy regained its footing. In 1924, there were more days of work lost due to strikes than in any other year since World War One began. State arbitration was used to settle many disputes, and membership in trade unions actually fell between 1922 and 1924. 

Sewell says that this recovery led to an increase in support for the SPD, which remained the largest party in the Reichstag. In contrast, the KPD remained illegal and was now led by the ultraleft faction headed by Fischer and Maslow. 

Sewell despairs at the fact that despite Lenin's writings, this faction of the KPD embarked on a course of setting up politically pure trade unions separate from the actual movement. This resulted in a loss of over one million voters in the election of December 1924. 

Sewell points to the dramatic loss of KPD delegates to the Trade Union Congress: from 88 in 1922 to only *four* by 1925! As a result of their failures, the ultralefts were expelled from the leadership at the request of the (now thoroughly Stalinist) Comintern. They were replaced by leaders more in tune with Moscow's influence. 

## 6.1. The 1925 presidential election
Sewell outlines the context for this election. President Ebert died in 1925, causing an election to be called. There were seven candidates, and the rightwing pooled their support behind Field Marshall von Hindenburg. The SPD initially ran their own candidate, Braun, but at the last minute pulled him out and put their support behind a center-right candidate run by the Catholic Center Party. They supposedly did this as a "lesser evil" strategy to defeat the right. The KPD had put up Thaelmann as their candidate. 

Sewell explains that by a small margin, Hindenburg won and was elected President. 

Sewell tells us that the period from 1925 to 1929 were the most stable years that the Weimar Republic would see. Prosperity began to return to Germany. 

## 6.2. The 1928 general election
Sewell says that by 1928, the boom was nearing its peak and there were widespread feelings of relaxation. This resulted in the the return of the "Grand Coalition" of the SPD under Herman Mueller. The bourgeois and fascist parties faced declining support, and the KPD and SPD increased in voters. 

Despite their 42% of the Reichstag, Sewell complains, the SPD and KPD coalition pursued pro-capitalist policies on all questions, giving rise to disillusionment among the German workers. This was worsened by the fact that the Comintern was firmly held by the Stalinist bureaucracy, who used it as a foreign policy tool instead of a revolutionary weapon. 

Sewell points to the failure of the [[China|Chinese]] revolution of 1925-27 and the defeat of the British general strike as examples of how "Stalin and Co" had misused the Comintern. These events also increased worker apathy which was useful to the bureaucracy. 

Sewell turns to Stalin's purges, which he says began by the expulsion of the Left Opposition, the deportation of Trotsky to Siberia, the purging of Bukharin's Right Opposition, and a flushing out of "unreliable" elements of the Comintern.

## 6.3. The 'Third Period'
Sewell explains how in August 1928, the Sixth Congress of the Comintern ushered in a new ultraleft turn in international policy. The Congress passed a resolution claiming that capitalism was entering a turbulent and final "Third Period." The first period was said to be the tumult of the postwar years, the second was the stable period, and now the third was said to be one of war and revolution.

However, Sewell claims, this was out of tune with reality. In fact, he says, the German economy wouldn't peak until April 1929, and the October 1929 crash was unpredicted by the Stalinists. Sewell says the Third Period policy would pave the way for a massive disaster in Germany. 

Sewell outlines the errors in tactics that flowed from this false theory. The Stalinists now said that the main threat was from the SPD and the trade unions. They called on the KPD to break with the SPD and establish "red unions." Stalin proclaimed that "Fascism and social democracy are not opposites, but twins."

Sewell says the KPD gladly jumped onto this bandwagon. They issued a pamphlet saying that the workers had to concentrate their fire on Social Democracy, and Thaelmann proclaimed the triumph of fascism as the Social Democrat Mueller gained election. 

Sewell describes the worsening economic conditions in Germany. Seasonal unemployment was rising and the KPD began organizing among the unemployed, and became disconnected from the labor movement. 

While this was happening, Sewell says, the SPD banned May Day demonstations under the pretext of preventing social unrest. Defying this, the KPD called on workers to assemble, and they did. The police responded by killing 25 workers and injuring hundreds. 

Sewell explains that these events caused many Social Democratic workers to go over to the Communist cause. 

## 6.4. The crash of 1929
Sewell explains the surge in economic production in Germany after all the foreign investment. German industry was now first-class globally, but there was now a need for markets soak up the production. 

The Wall Street crash of 1929 and the following slump, Sewell says, caused a catastrophe for German capitalism. Exports collapsed, banks failed, and loans evaporated. Germany lurched once again into crisis. 

Compounding this crisis, Sewell highlights, was the new policy by the Allies where German reparation payments would once again increase. The German bourgeois responded to the crisis by a campaign of mass sackings, tripling unemployment. 

Sewell says that by March, the Mueller government had collapsed. It was the last Weimar government to stand on a parliamentary majority. A decisive section of the German bourgeoisie began to come to terms with the need for a fascist reaction to solve the crisis. 

# 7. Fascism's rise to power
Sewell outlines the state of the forces of [[fascism]] before 1929. They were scattered, fragmented, and had no real influence or numbers beyond a few isolated elements. 

Sewell says that [[Hitler]] established the National Socialist German Workers' Party in 1919. This was abbreviated as the [[Nazi Party]]. It was only able to attract a few misfits from the German Army at first, and was only able to gain prominence by uniting with other fascist groups.

## 7.1. The Munich putsch
By 1923, Sewell continues, Hitler had joined forces with other anti-republican nationalist groups. These included some Freikorps units in Bavaria, and together they formed the German Fighting Union. 

Sewell describes the "abortive" attempt at a putsch in November 1923. Hitler and the other two leaders of the GFU tried to begin things without support from military leaders, and were arrested. 

Sewell says that the situation was bleak for the fascists when Hitler was released in late 1924. Recruits became scarce and the fascist movement saw their vote collapse from 2 million to less than one million between May 1924 and December 1924. The SPD gained a lot of votes in this time, and the Nazis only had 2.6% support. 

## 7.2. Big business turns to Hitler
Sewell describes the change in the fortunes of the Nazis that came by 1930. The German bourgeoisie poured a massive amount of resources into the Nazis. Fritz Thyssen, head of the steel trust, wrote a book called *I Paid Hitler,* outlining how he gave Hitler over one million marks and connected Hitler with the business community. Within two years, the Nazis would go from the smallest party in the Reichstag to the second largest. 

Sewell argues that the bourgeois support for fascism marked a qualitative shift in the tactics of the bourgeosie. Trotsky said that fascism was the "distilled essence of imperialism."

Sewell says that under normal conditions, the capitalists prefer bourgeois democracy as the cheapest and most stable form of government. They are unwilling to spend a penny more than necessary on the armed bodies of men that protect their interests, and prefer having a non-military, elected leadership to hold such bodies in check so that they don't consume an undue amount of money. This legislature also provides a useful pressure release valve for the masses. 

However, Sewell says, during deep crisis, the democratic concessions that the capitalists have handed out become problematic for the bosses, and are rescinded in order to allow the bosses to drive down living conditions enough to restore balance. The capitalists turn towards [[Bonapartism]], or, if that is not sufficient, fascism. 

Now, Sewell remarks, the large concessions won by the German workers necessitated severe counterattack by the German capitalists. They turned to the unpredictable and dangerous fascist movement for assistance.

## 7.3. A movement of the middle class
Sewell discusses the economic conditions that faced the petty bourgeoisie and the skilled professionals. Unemployment was sky high, inflation obliterated the savings of well-off workers and small business owners. Many professionals' living standards were below ordinary workers at this time. A professor was paid less than a factory worker, for instance. 

The German petty bourgeois, Sewell continues, didn't have the kinds of safety net that the workers did. They had no unions, contracts, or unemployment insurance. Many were thrown into the streets, passing into the [[lumpenproletariat]]. 

Sewell says this situation resulted in the...

> "...despair of the petty bourgeois, its yearning for change, the mass neurosis of the petty bourgeois, its readyness to believe in miracles, its readiness for violent measures; and the growth of its hostility to the proletariat, which had decieved its expectations."
> -- Trotsky

Sewell outlines how the fascists took advantage of this situation. They fed the frustrations of these groups, and pulled the various groups together under a message of "anti-capitalist demagogy."

Sewell clarifies that the middle class can't really play an independent political role, becuase of how diverse the interests of the groups wthin it are. Instead, the petty bourgeois tend to look either towards the proletariat, or the bourgeoisie for guidance. Due to the failure of the workers' organizations to provide any way forward, the German petty bourgeoisie started to look towards the bourgeoisie, and therefore the fascist movement, which the bourgeosie were funding.

Sewell turns back to the organization of the fascist movement. It started as anti-labor gangs which harassed workers' organizations. These formed the background of Hitler's Storm Troops, the SA and SS. However, these forces can only become a mass force under specific circumstances of economic crisis, stark failure of the workers' movement, and the backing of the ruling class. 

Sewell quotes Hitler, who said that the only thing that could have stopped the fascists is if the workers' organizations had smashed them before they were able to get the ball rolling. These gangs were quite weak at first, and the unions had much more powerful weapons at their disposal. Instead of using them, the workers' movement leaned on the German state and asked them to stop the fascists.

By the 1930s, Sewell says, the attitude of the masses had transformed from anger, to frustration, to despair. The SPD and KPD failed to integrate any of the petty bourgeois elements which were facing annihalation. Those layers turned to the fascists. However, the Nazis only got 3% of the factory committee elections, demonstrating that the millions of Nazi voters were firmly among the ranks of the middle classes. 

## 7.4. Stalinism and 'Social Fascism'
Sewell says that at the September 1930 Reichstag elections, the KPD placed third, after the SPD and Nazis. The Stalinists completely lost perspective and declared that this election was a massive victory. 

Sensing danger, Sewell explains, Trotsky and the Left Oppossition appealed to the KPD, saying that they should form a united block with the SPD to fight the fascists. Instead, the KPD had this to say:

> "In framing this block, Trotsky sees the only way for completely saving the German working class against fascism. Either the CP will make a block with the social democracy or the German working class is lost for 10-20 years. This is the theory of a completely ruined fascist and counter revolutionary. This theory is the worst theory, the most dangerous theory and the most criminal that Trotsky has constructed in the last years of his counter revolutionary propaganda."
> -- Ernst Thaelmann (top theorist of the KPD)

Sewell explains that the KPD decided to focus their energy on disrupting the meetings of the SPD! They broke up union meetings, workers' conferences, and more. They even allied with the Nazis to disrupt such meetings! Of course, the Stalinist Comintern supported such activities, calling the Social Democrats the "chief prop of the bourgeoisie."

## 7.5. The 'red referendum'
In August 1931, the author says, the Nazi Party launched a referendum to expel the Social Democratic government of Prussia. The KPD was urged by the Comintern to support the effort, and eventually did so. The KPD called the fascists and members of the storm troopers "working people's comrades." Fortunately, this referendum failed to get a majority.

Of course, Sewell continues, the KPD learned nothing from this experience, and continued to claim that the SPD were the "most active factor in creating fascism in Germany," according to Thaelmann. 

Across Europe, Sewell notes, the Stalinists were claiming that Social Democratic parties were opposed to working class parties, and that the only class unity that could repel fascism was unity under the Communist banner alone. This was ignoring the fact that the Stalinists in Germany had been working directly with the Nazis. 

Sewell explains that the main collaboration in question was a strike of German transport workers over wages. The Nazis, surprisingly, supported the strike and worked alongside the communists. The sight of fascists and communists working together alienated many Germans and support for the strike nosedived. Despite the urgent advice of Trotsky, the left was not making any attempt at creating a united defense against fascism. 

## 7.6. Hindenburg becomes President
Sewell provides the electoral context for 1932. Five elections took place in a single year as the German state was unable to create a stable coalition. In March, new presidential elections were held which resulted in Hindenburg with 53%, Hitler with 37%, and Thaelmann with 10% of the vote. The SPD supported the militarist Hindenburg as a lesser evil. 

The author says that Hindenburg appointed Franz von Papen as chancellor, who reversed anti-Nazi legislation, legalizing the SS gangs which had been outlawed. This sparked a reprisals campaign across the country with hundreds dead at the hands of the fascists. Franz von Papen went on to appoint himself head of Prussia, removing a SPD government on pretext. The workers called on the SPD leaders for a counterattack. 

Sewell explains that the SPD had the resources for such a push. They had the "Iron Front," a military organization of the labor movement, which contained over 3 million workers and a core of 400,000 highly trained soldiers. Instead, the SPD tried to calm the workers and instead pursued bourgeois legal action against the German state. The KPD called for a general strike, but was ignored after their collaboration with fascists. 

In the July elections, Sewell says, the Nazis became the largest party with 37% of the vote. The KPD got only 14%. Despite the idiotic tactics of the KPD, the masses were still slowly gravitating from the SPD to the KPD's orbit as the situation became more serious. 

In the November elections, the author continues, the Nazis lost some support as the peak of their movement passed. They were down to 33%, the SPD stood at 20%, and the KPD was rising at 17%. The KPD and SPD now had a majority block, if they decided to form a coalition. This was the last free election of Weimar Germany. 

## 7.7. Hitler becomes Chancellor
In January 1933, Sewell recounts, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor. Trotsky and the Left Opposition begged the German workers to begin a campaign of armed resistance to defend the life of the labor movement. Mass demonstrations began across the country, and most workers expected that a fight would soon begin. 

Sewell says that Hitler was confident in his position. Despite the fact that Nazis only held 3 of the 11 cabinet posts in the compromise coalition, he was willing to wait and prepare for his next move. Hitler and Goebbels planned to use new elections as a propaganda struggle, and would use all the resources of the state to gather support. 

Explaining the state of the labor leaders, Sewell says that they were issuing appeals for calm and were desperate to prevent a fight from breaking out between the fascists and the workers. They even defended the appointment of Hitler as a constitutional action that shouldn't be challenged. 

The Hitler government acted quickly, Sewell says. They banned all communist meetings, closed down left-wing newspapers, and murdered more than 50 anti-fascists during the election campaign. They purged state officials and replaced them with Nazi loyalists, and organized the SS gangs into auxillary police units that were loyal to the Nazis. 

## 7.8. The Reichstag fire
On February 27, 1933, Sewell says, the Nazis set fire to the Reichstag and blamed it on the communists. They used this as a pretext to ban the KPD and Goering called for the summary execution of all suspected communists in the country. Hindenburg played along, suspending free speech and assembly to allow the Nazis to clean house. 

Shamefully, Sewell tells us, the KPD responded to this by calling on all workers to *vote for KPD candidates!* About 4,000 KPD officials were arrested by the Nazis, allowing the latter to campaign without any real challenge from the other parties. 

Sewell describes the March election results. Despite the terror and violence they meted out, the Nazis still didn't have an absolute majority, and were well short of the two-thirds needed to change the constitution and institute a Nazi dictatorship. Even so, the fascists didn't see an issue. Goering felt that the other deputies could just be refused admittance to the Reichstag. They did just that, and passed an emergency declaration giving Hitler dictatorial powers. 

# 8. The Nazi terror
Sewell outlines the pathetic response to these events by the SPD and labor leaders. The SPD chairman resigned from the [[Second International]] in order to appease the Nazis, and the SPD disciplined any sub-group that tried to take covert action against the fascist dictatorship. "They grovelled before the Fuehrer as the iron-heel of fascist reaction bore down on the neck of the German working class."

Furthermore, Sewell continues, the SPD decided to vote for Hitler's foreign policy, even as the German police occupied the offices of the SPD and arrested its leaders. By June, the entire party was outlawed and by July, a new law was decreed proclaiming the Nazis as the only political party in Germany. 

## 8.1. Smashing the unions
Sewell says that the unions fared no better than the SPD. The labor leaders capitulated to Hitler's demand that Labor Day be renamed National Labor day. After the unions had disgraced themselves by parading under Nazi banners, Hitler had the leaders arrested and sent to concentration camps. The workers put up little resistance. 

## 8.2. The Stalinist response
Sewell accuses the KPD of utterly failing to distinguish revolution from counter-revolution. Even as their organizations were smashed, they talked about a new revolutionary upsurge just around the corner. They thought that since the masses were no longer under the sway of the SPD, they would join the KPD and a revolution would happen any minute. They still clung to the idea that the "social fascists" were the primary enemy!

Sewell explains the political line taken by the Comintern Executive in April - that the actions of the KPD before the Nazis took power were completely validated! The Stalinist Third International was now a "stinking corpse."

## 8.3. The night of the long knives
Sewell says that after supressing organized labor, Hitler turned inward. He moved to crush the ideologues within the Nazi Party that demanded a "second revolution" to achieve National Socialism. In reality, the Nazis had been carrying out the demands of the capitalists this whole time, and continued by crushing internal anti-capitalism. The only demand that Hitler kept was the persecution of the Jews, which was used as a release valve for the anger of the petty bourgeois, who Hitler knew he could never really please.

Once the Nazis firmly weilded state power, Sewell explains, their social base began to erode as they failed to provide any real solutions for the middle class. More and more, they resembled a classic Bonapartist police state. 

Sewell provides his analysis of why the Nazis won. It was the fault of the labor leaders and the KPD, who had all the resources needed to sweep Hitler off the streets, but failed to lift a finger as he walked into the halls of power. The KPD was the most powerful communist party outside of the USSR, but pursued the ultra-left "Third Period" policy to its own demise. 

Sewell recounts the blood price paid by the rank-and-file of the KPD for their leaders' incompitence. Over 2,000 were immediately murdered, and a further 130,000 were sent to concentration camps where they were gassed, beheaded, shot, and tortured. 

## 8.4. Can fascism rise again?
Sewell turns to the present (2006) state of the world. The capitalists are facing a world crisis similar to the 1930s, but they remember the price paid by the German bourgeoisie for the use of the fascists. Once the Nazis were in power, they were no longer under the control of the capitalists, and the state apparatus gained a degree of independence. This independence was terrible for the German capitalists in the long run, and within 15 years the entire country had been leveled in a total war caused by the Nazis expansionist policy and refusal to negotiate. Fascism proved to be a very costly tactic.

Sewell cites the failed "Generals' Plot" of 1944 as an attempt by the old German ruling class to re-assert control by assassinating Hitler. 

Today, Sewell continues, we have a totally different balance of forces. The middle classes have largely been absorbed by the working class, and many white collar workers are more connected to the trade unions than was the case in 30s Germany. The students, who were a wellspring of reaction, are now the cutting edge of the left. The proletariat is now the decisive force on a global scale. 

The capitalists, Sewell explains, now prefer to use fascist gangs as an auxillary, but only in order to create the conditions for military dictatorship, which they believe to be more stable. However, these formations lack the mass basis that fascism had. They cannot rely on that mass basis, becauase it has dwindled alongside the power of the middle classes. 

Wrapping up, Sewell explains what today's task is. We must learn the lessons of these events in Germany, but we must also learn the forces that caused these events, and understand the different forces that now act upon our society. The task is to re-arm the labor movement with the ideas of Marxism and a leadership fit for the position at the head of the working class. 

# 9. Postscript
This postscript consists of a quote from the autobiography of Leopold Trepper, an ex-Stalinist and organizer of the Soviet spy network in Germany.

> A FINAL WORD: I belong to a generation that has been sacrificed by history. The men and women who came to communism in the glow of the October Revolution carried along by the great momentum of the rising revolution certainly did not imagine that fifty years later, nothing would be left of Lenin but the body embalmed in Red Square. The revolution has degenerated and we have gone down with it.
> 
> "This century has brought forth two monsters, fascism and Stalinism, and our ideal has been engulfed in this apocalypse. The absolute idea that gave meaning to our lives has aquired a face whose features we no longer recognise. Our failure forbids us to give advice, but because history has too much imagination to repeat itself, it remains possible to hope.
> 
> "I do not regret the commitment of my youth, I do not regret the paths I have taken. In Denmark, in the fall of 1973, a young man asked me in a public meeting, 'Haven't you sacrificed your life for nothing?' I replied, 'No.'
> 
> "No, on one condition: that people understand the lesson of my life as a communist and a revolutionary, and do not turn themselves over to a deified party. I know that youth will succeed where we have failed, that socialism will triumph and that it will not have the colour of the Russian tanks that crushed Prague.
