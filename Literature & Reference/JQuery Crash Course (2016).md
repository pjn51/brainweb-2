I will be following along with this tutorial in the `testing_ground.html` file in my `javascript` folder. 

# 1. Intros and selectors
This video series aims to answer the question, "[[What is JQuery?]]" The author says that we need to understand DOM manipulation and Ajax, so I have to ask: [[What is Ajax?]] [[What is a DOM?]]

In order to use JQuery, the video explains, we must add a little code to our [[HTML]] file:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script>
```

He explains that this goes and retrieves the latest JQuery (version 3.1.0 as of this video) and uses it.
