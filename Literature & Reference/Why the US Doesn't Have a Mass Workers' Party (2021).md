Trottier begins by quoting [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] and [[Alan Woods]]:

> If our program obliges us to maneuver energetically in a constantly changing environment, among unparalleled difficulties, that is not our fault. We do not choose the conditions under which we must function any more than we choose our own parents.
> - Trotsky

>The first task of the Marxists is to work out correct ideas, policies, program, and perspectives. The second task, even more complicated and difficult than the first, is to find the way to link up the scientific program of Marxism with the necessarily unfinished, confused and contradictory movement of the masses. If we fail to establish this link, we become a sect, neither more nor less.
>- Alan Woods

The author goes on to outline the current conditions of bourgeois democracy in the [[USA]]. Millions are dissatisfied with the choice between the Republican and [[Democratic Party]] candidates. These two parties are united in their support for [[capitalism]], and the international policy of [[imperialism]]. Neither party truly represents the interests of the working class, even though they attempt to lure this or that section of the class into supporting their candidates. 

Trottier disagrees with those who say that this is a technical issue, and cite the "two party system" as the culprit for this situation. The real issue is that the [[proletariat]] doesn't have its own party. Whether there are two political parties or ten, the workers must have one of their own.

The author cites [[Engels]], who commented on the fact that the [[USA]] had a very cemented duopoly, back in 1891. Engels included lobbyists, NGOs, and others in what he said was a system where groups practially speculated on seats in Congress, and were rewarded for their investments in the re-election campaigns of those who succeeded. 

Trottier asks us why there isn't a workers party in the United States, and what lessons we could learn from the past.

# The class struggle: political, economic, and theoretical battles
Trottier explains the process through which the working class develops [[class consciousness]] - through struggle. By fighting to build [[unions]], tenants' organizations, and other mass organizations,  in both the political and economic realms. 

Introducing the workers' party, Trottier explains how this is a qualitative step forward in the class struggle. The [[workers' party]] reflects the shift in the minds of a large section of the workers, who now see themselves *as* workers with a shared political interest. In countries with mass workers' parties, the class struggle can now take place in the streets, in the workplaces, and in the legislature. 

Trottier says that when the workers have their own party, they no longer have to make demands on the capitalist parties. Now, they can support their own party coming to power. No matter the program of this party, which could have large holes or misconceptions, this party allows workers to see themselves as a force fighting for their own interests. The building of such a force requires both objective factors and subjective decisions made by leaders. This means that theoretical struggle is just as important as physical struggle to build such a party.

# What is a mass workers' party?
Trottier quotes [[Zinoviev]], who defined a party as "a party of a particular class, which has arisen from its depths and has linked its fate with it." Adding to this definition, Trottier says a *mass* workers' party would be one that represents a substantial amount of the working class. As of 2021, only 11% of the workforce is unionized, but that's still enough to qualify the unions as mass organizations.

Trottier examines the class composition of the Green Party. This is not a mass party, since it doesn't enjoy mass support among the population. It also isn't a workers' party, since it arose out of a layer of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] and not the working class. There are workers within it, but it doesn't represent the interests of the working class. 

Trottier expands on the ways that workers parties can develop. Sometimes, the union movement can spark the development of a workers' party, and sometimes the situation happens in reverse. He illustrates this using the example of the NDP in [[Canada]], which formed out of an alliance between the unions and a small [[reformism|reformist]] socialist party. 

# The historic interests of the working class
Trottier says that in order to be a *genuine* workers' party, the party must have the historical interests of the workers in its heart. This means that the party must be committed to bringing an end to capitalism, and moving towards [[socialism]]. Because of this, a genuine workers' party must be armed with the ideas of [[Marxism]]. 

To me, this raises questions. If a workers' party needs to be committed to socialism, does the [[Labour Party (UK)]] no longer count since they removed the socialist clause? Are unions included, since most don't define themselves as socialist, much less Marxist?

The author explains the difference between a fully formed genuine revolutionary workers' party and what we will likely see develop. The process of getting to a completely revolutionary program will be a drawn-out battle between different currents within the workers' party. 

Despite the fact that a reformist leadership that pushes against [[class independence]] would likely control such a party in its infancy, Trottier argues such a party would still be qualitatively different from the bourgeois parties. The workers' party would be in a constant internal struggle, and such temporary seizures of leadership by reformist elements wouldn't be cause for abandoning hope.

I think that he should expand more on why a reformist, class collaborationist party would be qualitatively different that the Democratic Party. I would assume that a workers' party requires an internal conversation and debate, as well as meaningful internal democracy, which the DNC lacks.
