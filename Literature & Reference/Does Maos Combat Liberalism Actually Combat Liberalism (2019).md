'Combat Liberalism' was published in 1942, and was meant to help defeat internal enemies in the CCP. Mao lists a number of things he sees as harmful behaviors to be avoided by his comrades. However, in this article, he confuses the true nature of [[liberalism]] and puts forward a method of bureaucratic centralism, not [[democratic centralism]]. 

## 'How to be a Bolshevik?'
Mao puts forward a method of training that is too organizational. A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] is not someone who sticks to a clear code of conduct, but someone who is trained in the authentic methods of [[Marxism]]. 

[[Mao]] presents [[liberalism]] as an attitude, not as a ideology rooted in class interest of the capitalists. Because of this, a code of conduct for members to follow (while important for a serious organization) cannot "combat liberalism" within the party. This also tends towards [[idealism]], in stating that in order to be revolutionary, one must have a certain attitude, rather than a concrete political perspective.

## Empty moralising
In the end, correct personal attitude can only bring a movement so far. The comrades of the [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] Communist Party were dedicated and professional, but were massacred because their policy of [[class independence|class-collaborationism]] led them to trust in their national [[bourgeoisie]].
