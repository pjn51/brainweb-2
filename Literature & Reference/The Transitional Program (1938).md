> Written by [[Trotsky]], this theory deals with the tactics and the demands [[trotskyism|Trotskyists]] ought to call for in order to raise the [[consciousness]] of the [[proletariat]]. 
# The Objective Prerequisites for a Socialist Revolution
Trotsky begins by saying [[The crisis of our era is the lack of proletarian leadership]] (Marxist Classics v.1, p.184). 

The objective conditions for revolution were already present in the 40s, and the only thing standing in the way was the lack of a leadership for the working class that could provide a revolutionary way forward.

He explains that the New Deal was only possible because of the staggering wealth accumulated by the [[USA|American]] [[bourgeoisie]]. Without an economic upswing, he continues, these kinds of programs were also a blind alley (Ibid, p.184). 

Far from not being ready, the conditions are becoming rotten. Without a revolution, a catastrophe threatened humanity. 

> Q: Trotsky paints a bleak picture for the future of [[capitalism]], written just before the largest upswing in the history of capitalism. Why did he not predict that a war would destroy massive amounts of productive potential, allowing capitalism to begin a period of expansion?*

# The Proletariat and its Leadership
The main thing holding the working class back is the [[opportunism]] of the leadership. When the masses move towards revolution again and again, their conservative leading strata hold them back. We can see examples of this in [[Spain]], [[France]], and the [[USA]]. 

The [[Comintern]], far from acting as the [[vanguard]] of the revolutionary proletariat, is part of the bulwark protecting the bourgeois order. Their Popular Front tactics amount to class collaborationism and always lead to defeat, clearing the road for [[fascism]] in the process.

The last resources of [[imperialism]] against the workers - fascism and Peoples' Fronts. These twin phenomenon bound the workers for destruction. 

However, no amount of betrayal or manuevering can halt the wheel of history. The objective conditions for revolution exist, the decaying of capitalism and the decline of living standards. The efforts that these charlatans make towards defanging the workers will eventually help the workers to see that they must push through these so-called allies. 

# The Minimum Program and the Transitional Program
The task at hand was to overcome a central contradiction. The objective conditions were mature, while the proletariat was still immature in its outlook, even the vanguard. The old layer was confused and depressed, while the younger layer is inexperienced. 

Trotsky argued that a plan was needed to raise the horizons of the workers from their current concerns towards a revolutionary perspective. Trotsky called demands that would do this *transitional demands* (Ibid, p.186). [[Transitional demands bridge reform and revolution]]. 

This is different from the Social Democratic practice of having a minimum program of reforms and a maximum program of revolution. There was no bridge between these two programs, and the winning of the minimum program did not move the workers closer to developing a consciousness required for the maximum program to be achieved. 

The Fourth International defended the gains that workers have made, but recognized that the purpose of that International was not the winning of reforms, but the overthrow of capitalism in general. The [[Fourth International]] proposed instead a series of transitional demands, that would act as a bridge between the reforms that were being organically demanded by the workers towards the raising of class consciousness. 

# Sliding Scale of Wages and Hours
During a decline of capitalism, there are two main afflictions that every worker can relate to, no matter their position or region. *Unemployment, and increasing costs of goods.* Because of this, the Fourth International took up these demands as well, demanding employment and decent living conditions for all. 

The most complete solution to the issue of rising costs would be to have a policy of maintaining the purchasing power of [[wages]]. As the prices of goods increase, wages must increase in lockstep. That was a demand that the Fourth International took up. 

The other half of the issue is unemployment. In a society based on exploitation, the only serious right left to the worker is the right to work. Therefore, the Fourth International also took up the demand for jobs for all. As above, the most complete solution to this is to engineer a program of dividing working hours evenly between the workers. This would eliminate unemployment while decreasing the burden on overworked workers. 

These two programs, combined with a strong minimum wage that would prevent earnings from sliding as the work is spread out more and more, would be a great start. They would be a great start precisely because capitalism is incapable of meeting these goals. An attempt to meet such popular yet impossible tasks would point more and more workers towards the incapability of capitalism to manage society. 

# Trade Unions in the Transitional Epoch
The [[unions]], the author says, far from having outlived their usefulness, as some ultralefts were saying at the time, were poised for massive growth. He argued that [[Bolsheviks]] should stand in the front lines of all types of struggles, even when they involve only meager gains for the workers. They do this, Trotsky explains, in order to raise the spirit of militancy in these struggles, and to raise the horizons of the organizations that wage such struggles. 

Trotsky argues that Marxists must oppose any attempt to subordinate the unions to the bourgeois state (Ibid, p.189). This seems like a centrally important point, if the unions are to act as a revolutionary school for the workers and a genuine vehicle of the class struggle. 

Those who prefer to build smaller 'revolutionary' unions that act as miniature versions of their parties have renounced the struggle for the leadership of the working class, according to the author. They refuse, he continues, to work within organizations that are not explicitly associated with their ideology. Trotsky says that at the same time as the Fourth International dedicated itself to working within the trade [[unions]], it also asserted that there were limitations to trade unions as organizations of the working class. 

They cannot replace the party because they cannot offer a finished program like a party can. They also tend to be composed of the better paid workers, and when the mass of worse-off workers enter the struggle, new organizations must be created to meet their needs and organize them. Due to the tendency of unions to be composed of the upper layers of the working class, they can also develop compromising tendencies within them, especially their leadership. 

Because of these limitations, sections of the Fourth International were encouraged to try and renew the leaderships of unions at critical moments, and also to create new organizations of the working class during intense moments of struggle. 

They were encouraged to orient themselves towards the unions as [[mass organizations]], but not to fetishize unions. Trotsky could concieve of a time where it would even be appropriate to break with the conservative union structures in favor of the revolutionary mass movement. 

# Factory Committees
The workers' movement is an unpredictable, turbulent affair. Hopeful leaders of this movement must not approach it in a routine way, but must always base their methods and slogans on what stage the movement is at, and where it appears to be heading. 

Sit-down strikes were the latest expression of the workers movement at this time. They were a very powerful tool, because regardless of the demands that the workers were raising, their temporary seizure of the factory broke the sanctity of capitalist property. 

The committees that developed to manage such strikes were the organizational expression of this breach of capitalism. Elected by the workers, these ==factory committees== created a counterweight against the administration in the workplaces. 

Both the factory administration and the trade union bureaucrats will resist the creation of these committees, as the factory committee challenges the power of both groups, and poses a reality of [[dual power]] in the workplace. 

Wherever workplaces are already unionized, the factory committee would probably take the form of the union in that workplace, but would expand the function and become more militant than the normal bureaucratic structure.

At the time, the struggle was at the point where the call for factory committees was a good idea. There were waves of sit-down strikes, and the establishment of these committees is the next step. But today, we would not call for factory committees until there were strike waves occurring often in many workplaces. 

# Business Secrets and Workers’ Control
At the time, all the schools of bourgeois thought agreed that regulation and state planning was needed in the economy. However, this was running headlong into the sabotage of the owners. It was not effective for managing capitalism, much less was it revolutionary. 

Trotsky pointed out that the total subservience of such 'reformers' towards the owners could be seen in their unwillingness to expose the business secrets of the owners. This was one area in which the government was forbidden to enter. 

These secrets are portrayed as the secrets that firms keep from one another. But when we look closely, we see that the situation is really one of the owners keeping a secret from the workers - the secret of just how much profit they are reaping off the [[labor]] of the workers. 

Exposing this information would allow the workers to see how much the capitalist is really benefiting off of them, and would motivate them to further action against the capitalists. Having all the facts would also allow the workers to begin the conceptualization of a broad economic plan. 

## Expropriation of Separate Groups of Capitalists
During the lead up to a revolution, Trotsky says that we shouldn't let the program of expropriating the whole capitalist class stop us from expropriating one or two of the most parasitic capitalists if given the chance. 

This is totally separate from the question of [[economic planning|nationalization]]. [[state]] carries out nationalization, while we advocate the working class itself carrying out an expropriation of the capitalists. This gives the workers a better sense of their own strength, and prepares them for further advances on the field of battle. 

We may have to approach the expropriation of each industrial sector at a different time, because the workers may have more or less willpower in one field over another. Only a general revolutionary upsurge can pave the way for a total, final expropriation. 

# Expropriation of the Private Banks...
Under imperialism, finance [[capital]] controls the heights of the economy. It is impossible to make a dent against the crises of capitalism and the anarchy of the market without taking hold of the banks and using them as a tool for the working class. 

Only the expropriation of all the major banks and the centralization of their power into the hands of the working class can accomplish this. The best method for concentrating and weilding this power is through the state, but only if the state is controlled by the workers. 

This doesn't imply the expropriation of everyones' bank accounts. In fact, a single state-owned bank would be able to provide better rates and better security for the savings of the average person, and would be able to provide cheaper loans for small businesses. 

## The Picket Line, Defense Guards/Workers' Militia and the Arming of the Proletariat
Revolutions don't appear out of thin air - their arrival is heralded over and over by clear signals that Marxists should be able to pick up on. Failure to heed these signals will lead to a misunderstanding of the state of the movement, such as what happend in [[Italy]] in 1919-20 when the workers seized the factories, but the workers' organizations did nothing, fearing the fascists. 

As the workers sharpen their attacks on the capitalists, the capitalists will also sharpen their attacks on the workers. We cannot be caught unaware when the owners strike back harder and harder against every move made by the workers. 

These counterattacks will come from more sources than the police and army. The owners maintain detachments of armed thugs, private security, and in the heat of conflict, will turn to fascist elements to defend their property. 

> The reformists systematically implant in the minds of the workers the notion that the sacredness of democracy is best guaranteed when the bourgeoisie is armed to the teeth and the workers are unarmed.

The only defense against [[fascism]] and against the forces of the owners are armed detachments of workers who feel the support of the working class behind them. 

Scabs and private security are the basic unit of the owners' army, while strike pickets are the basic unit of the proletarian army. Marxists should strive to create detachments for self-defense at every strike, and in every strike committee there should be discussions of security. 

An upsurge in the movement ought to bring an increase in the number of these detachments, and in the breadth in which they are organized - from workplace to neighborhood to region. 

# The Alliance of Workers and Farmers
The workers interests are inseperable from rural laborers. These two groups are natural allies. On the other hand, the peasantry is the natural ally of the petit bourgeois in the cities. 

Just as the urban petit bourgeois is composed of many layers, some of which will break towards the working class and some towards the ruling class in a revolution, so too will the peasantry react.

The task of the industrial proletariat is to carry the class struggle into the country, to split apart the rural laborers and revolutionary peasants from the reactionary peasantry and big landowners. 

"Independent" farmers are in reality very dependent on the rest of society, particularly the banks from whom they must get loans. This enables the small farmers to have a revolutionary perspective. Farmers' committees, allied with workers' committees, should come together and make demands for cheaper [[commodities]]. 

# The Struggle Against Imperialism and War
The Stalinists basically gave up any anti-war principles the second a war seemed possible. *This seems too harsh to me. The USSR was actually under siege, so being on a militant stance makes sense to me. *

Bourgeois [[pacifism]] sounds nice, but always ends up being disarmament for the working class, while the ruling class is allowed to continue its domination. 

“Defense of the Fatherland” works well as a bourgeois rallying cry because it means different things to different classes. To the worker, it means defending their home and community from the ravages of war. To the capitalist, it means defending the profit of the country through imperialism and aggression. 

Workers should support workers’ states and colonized countries in any military conflict, but not through the apparatus of the state that they live under. Instead they should use their own means, such as agitation, boycott, and strike. 

# Workers’ and Farmers’ Government
The refusal of The Socialist Revolutionaries and The [[Mensheviks]] to take power in Russia when they had the opportunity doomed them in the court of public opinion, paving the way for the success of the Bolsheviks. 

The traditional workers organizations, including the Stalinists, would also refuse to take power at the critical moment. However, they theoretically could be forced by circumstance or pressure to go farther than they would prefer. 

# Soviets
Soviets are the structure through which the vast array of small committees and organizations that will be sure to form during a social crisis will be harmonized. 
They can only arrive at a stage of open revolution. 

# Backwards Countries and the Program of Transitional Demands
Backward countries, such as colonial and semi-colonial ones, are part of a world utterly dominated by [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)|imperialism]]. This creates an interesting blend of primitive development with the latest extractive technology. 

The central task for these countries is the agrarian revolution (the throwing off of feudal ties) and national independence (the overthrow of imperialism) 

We cannot reject the democratic program, but we must aid the masses in outgrowing it. 

# The Program of Transitional Demands in Fascist Countries
[[fascism|Fascist]] ‘ideology’ is not a driving force, and isn't taken seriously by the working class. The middle classes are the target audience for that stuff. The only reason opposition was small in Italy and [[Germany]] was the total failure of any other ideology, and the destruction of the workers’ movement. 

Whenever the workers’ movement collapses, reaction is sure to follow. This collapse was due to the cowardice and stupidity of the leaders of the Social Democratic parties. 
What does ‘Thermidorian’ mean? It appears to refer to the betrayal of Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. 

The class dynamics and economic forces that ferment revolution cannot be halted by totalitarianism, and will bubble up again and again. 

While a revolutionary movement would be hard-pressed to begin in fascist territory, once unleashed it would release a lot of bottled-up energy and power. Did we see this happen after the fall of Germany and Italy? 

It is appropriate to use democratic and liberal slogans to mobilize the masses, but only as a stepping stone in a larger orientation towards workers’ control. 

# The USSR and Problems of the Transitional Epoch
The USSR became a degenerated workers’ state soon after its creation. The contradiction between the bureaucracy and the people will either be resolved through a return to capitalism, or an overthrow of the bureaucrats and an opening of the way to [[socialism]]. 

The Moscow Trials were a natural outgrowth of the bureaucracy, not the actions of a lone dictator as some have said. They grew out of the unbearable contradictions of the USSR. 

There are currents of authentic Bolshevism within the bureaucracy, however the currents of reaction and counter-revolution are growing more swiftly. 

The [[Bonapartism|proletarian-bonapartist]] nature of [[Stalin]]’s regime means that they have to crush the leftward flank of the Party and of the working class. 

# Against Opportunism and Unprincipled Revisionism
During periods of failure, many seek to reject the past instead of learning from it, rejecting [[Marxism]] and Bolshevism. 

"In a society based upon exploitation, the highest moral is that of the social revolution. All methods are good which raise the class consciousness of the workers."

# Against [[sectarianism]]
On the other hand, some on the left refuse to struggle because organizations or movements are tinged with a liberal or bourgeois element. They don't understand that we must struggle within organizations as well as outside of them. 

"He who does not seek and does not find the road to the masses is not a fighter but a dead weight to the party. A program is formulated not for the editorial board or for the leaders of discussion clubs, but for the revolutionary action of millions."

# Open the Road to the Woman Worker! Open the Road to the Youth!
Movements are revitalized by new generations entering the class struggle, who are not weighted down by the failures of the past.

[[opportunism|Opportunists]] tend to seek out the top layer of the working class, but we ought to seek out the most oppressed layers because that's where we will find the most revolutionary spirit. 

## Under the Banner of the Fourth International
The fourth international was created in the wake of the greatest defeat in the history of the proletariat. They tried to stay optimistic but the next period proved to be another series of defeats. However, they kept the flame of genuine Bolshevism alive until our current moment, where perhaps it will be able to have renewed power and influence. As Lenin said, "There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen."
