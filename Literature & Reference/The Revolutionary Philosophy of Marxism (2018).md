# Introduction by [[Alan Woods]]
The understanding of dialectical materialism is essential for those who wish to be called Marxists. Unfortunately, [[Marx]] never quite got around to writing a whole book about the topic, and neither did [[Engels]]. This collection of exerpts and works of various authors will do nicely. 

## The decay of modern [[philosophy]]
Modern philosophy is trapped in the swamp of [[postmodernism]], which declares that the world is unknowable. It's therefore no wonder that most people have nothing but disdain for modern philosophy. 

## Empiricism versus dialectics
[[metaphysics]], which declares that we must study the facts alone to arrive at conclusions, played a progressive role in cutting through the mysticism at the beginning of the Enlightenment. However, we lose track of the proceesses *behind* the facts when we take this line of thinking too far. 

## The demand for 'the facts'
While we should study the facts to learn about the world, the idea that we can simply study the facts alone without bringing our preconceptions into the picture is silly. Those who believe that they can make observations and know things without having a personal philosophy end up repeating whatever mainstream philosophy is in vogue at their time. Today, that means [[empiricism]] and postmodernism. 

## [[dialectics]]
The term dialiectics comes from the Greeks, who applied the idea to conversation. As two people talked, they would change their arguments in conversation with one another. Then, their points of view would synthesize and be raised to a higher level. 

Applied more generally, dialectics is a dynamic view that frees human thought from the straitjacket of formal logic. It sees the facts before our eyes not as static things-in-themselves, but as definite stages of a process, or intersection of processes. 

## The Hegelian dialectic
[[Hegel]] continued where the Greeks left off, and expanded on the theory of dialectics. However, he did so on the basis of [[idealism]]. He thought that by studying the dialectical movement of human thought, he could arrive at some kind of Absolute Idea, the perfect thought. 

It was only Marx and Englels who took Hegel's dialectics and put it on a basis of [[materialism]]. 

## The law of identity
In empiricism, *A = A* and *B = B*, and never the twain shall meet. However, this ignores the fact that the world is a constantly shifting place. I was once a teenager, and now I am not. So, at some point, the situation went from *A = A* to *A = B*. Empiricism cannot explain this, and the whole *Ship of Theseus* 'paradox' shows this to be a thing they worry about. 

## Cognition
The early empiricists were materialists, and viewed cognition as "I interpret the world through my senses." However, this is one-sided. The world exists outside of our senses, and we actually think with our whole body.

The purpose of thinking is to transform phenomenae in the world into useful generalizations that allow us to survive. 

## The unity of opposites
There is no up without down, no day without night. Since everything exists in motion towards a new state, nothing can exist without having *something* to be moving away from, and *something* to be moving towards. 

## Quantity and quality
At some point, as events add up in a quantitative way, eventually a qualitative change appears. Take the example of water being heated. I've written about this one so many times that I'm going to skim. 

## Criticality
...

## The dialectics of *Capital*
...

## Particular and universal
...

## Can human society be understood?
Postmodernism declares that it cannot be, and empiricism in general fails to even attempt to create a theory of generalized human development. 

## Historical materialism
[[historical materialism]] is the application of dialectical materialism to human history. For more on this topic, see [[stages of historical development]]. 

## Class society
...

## Contradictions in society
...

## The tipping point
...

## The role of the individual
Anti-Marxists often claim that Marx erased the role of the individual in history, but he didn't. He and Engels made it clear that individuals made history, but they just clarified that they didn't make it as they please, they couldn't just do whatever they want. People are confined by the material world they are born into. 

## Dialectics - the scientific basis of revolutionary practice
Theory is the [[DNA]] of the revolutionary organization. Through theory, we can grow and develop as a social force capable of finishing the revolution that the working class will inevitably begin.
