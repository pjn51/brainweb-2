# Introduction to the 1969 edition
Indescriminate use of the term fascism only reflects an un-scientific attitude and a certain vagueness that many on the left have when it comes to fascism. The reformists and [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] prefer this since both groups totally failed to stand against fascism in [[Germany]] and would prefer that we not firmly understand how fascism arose and could have been defeated. 

When the [[Nazi Party]] began to advance, the Communist movement was in the middle of an ultraleft binge (the Third Period). They were calling every bourgeois party fascist, and [[Stalin]] said that fascism and social democracy were twins. He then labled all socialists outside the Communist party as 'social-fascists' and told the German communists not to work with them under any circumstances, including [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]]. 

After Hitler's rise, the Stalinists claimed to have been totally correct, and that fascism could only last a few months, to be followed by a Soviet Germany. These claims were also false. 

# Fascism -- What Is It?
Some claim that all forms of counter-revolutionary dictatorship are fascist. This is false, and un-scientific. The fascist movement in Italy was an organic movement that had a mass character. Its leaders sprung forth from the rank-and-file, and while it was certainly funded by the bourgeoisie, it sprung forth from the [[peasantry]], the [[petty bourgeoisie]], and even some elements of the proletariat. This is very distinct from other forms of dictatorship or monarchy, which are based on the state and the bourgeoisie rather than other classes. 

# How Mussolini Triumphed
Fascism can arise when the normal resources of the bourgeois state are no longer enough to keep balance in society. At this moment, fascists can rally the petit bourgeoise and the [[lumpenproletariat]] to action. 

The bourgeoisie expect a service of fascism, and fascism certainly provides it. [[Fascism has a petty bourgeois base]] that it uses to smaash all the organizations of the working class, and begin to create an apparatus to penetrate deeply into the proletariat, with the purpose of preventing any organizations from emerging. 

The rise of fascism in Italy was only possible due to the betrayal of the proletariat by the reformists. In 1920, workers throughout the country seized factories and controlled whole industries. The [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was at hand, but the leaders of the reformist organizations got cold feet and abandoned the effort. As the momentum of the revolution stalled, the fascists began to organize. 

In the face of the violent campaign of the fascists, the social democratic leaders were at a loss. They thought that they could persuade the bourgeoisie to stop supporting the fascists if they offered concessions, but this only had the effect of demoralizing the workers. They failed to understand that [[A revolution is all-or-nothing]]. 

While fascism utilizes the mass forces of the petit bourgeoisie, it has no choice but to strangle these very forces once it has state power, as it cannot really solve the problems that agitated that class into action. It bureaucratizes, approaching the methods of a normal military dictatorship. 

# The Fascist Danger Looms In Germany
In 1930 Germany, the Communist Party was making big gains in the elections. However, these were dwarfed by the gains made by the Nazis, and the [[reformism|Social Democrats]] had more votes than the CP. 

Trotsky said that considering the conditions at the time, the CP should have been doing much better than it was. The leaders of the CP had underestimated themselves, and therefore hadn't been agressive enough. But they had also underestimated the task before them. 

In order for the revolution to succeed, the petit bourgeoisie has to shift towards the proletariat. The opposite was happening in Germany. 

The CP had also increased the strength of social democracy through its incorrect line on 'social fascism.' This had inocculated the social democratic workers against persuasion towards the CP. 

# An Aesop Fable
Trotsky tells us a metaphorical story of how the ComIntern acted in Germany:

> A cattle dealer once drove some bulls to the slaughterhouse. And the butcher came night with his sharp knife. 
> "Let us close ranks and jack up this executioner on our horns," suggested one of the bulls. 
> "If you please, in what way is the butcher any worse than the dealer who drove us hither with his cudgel?" replied the bulls, who had received their political education in Manuilsky's institute. [The Comintern.] 
> "But we shall be able to attend to the dealer as well afterwards!"
> "Nothing doing," replied the bulls firm in their principles, to the counselor. 
> "You are trying, from the left, to shield our enemies -- you are a social-butcher yourself." 
> And they refused to close ranks.

# The German Cops and Army
The social democrats rely not on the working class for protection, but the German police. Even though the police were recruited from the heavily social-democratic workers, their environment determines their [[class consciousness]]. The German worker who becomes a cop is now a cop, and has more experience cracking leftist skulls than Nazi skulls. 

The social democrats had created their "Iron Front," a coalition of unions and bourgeois parties. It had combat groups that could have stood against the Nazis, but this group was never used. 

Instead of relying on the Iron Front, the social democrats placed all their trust in the leaders of the bourgeois state, claiming that the bonapartist leadership of one after another German politician would be the bulwark against Hitler. Instead, they handed the state to Hitler on a platter. 

# Bourgeoisie, Petty Bourgeoisie, and Proletariat
The bourgeoisie, being such a tiny fraction of the population, naturally relies on the petit bourgeoisie and sections of the proletariat to maintain its rule. 

We can divide the stages of bourgeois rule into three. In the first stage, the capitalists required revolutionary tools to secure their overthrow of feudalism. The method of this stage was **Jacobinism**. 

In the second stage, during the bloom of capitalism, the capitalists relied on **democracy** to keep order, as living standards were still rising and not much resistance was to be expected.

In the third stage, the decline of capitalism, **fascism** is the program at hand. 

Notably, all three of these political programs, Jacobinism, democracy, and fascism, are petit bourgeois currents. This shows the decisive role the petit bourgeois plays when it comes to maintaining capitalism. 

# The Collapse of Bourgeois Democracy
Even in countries that had "healthy" democracies, the decline of capitalism caused struggle to intensify. However, the police and military often aren't enough to beat back the people. Radical right gangs are needed, and that is the service fascism provides. 

The fascists find their material mainly in the petit bourgeois. They are angry because they have been totally destroyed by capitalism, but are inherently reactionary. The big bourgeoisie turns these folk against the worker. 

# Does the Petty Bourgeoisie Fear Revolution?
Obviously, the small capitalist perfers law and order when business is going well, but during a crisis the petit bourgeois can be swayed to the side of revolution, either a workers' revolution or fascist counter-revolution. 

However, the petit bourgeois is politically atomized due to its social environment. It requires leadership to act politically. This leadership can only be provided by the other classes, either the proletariat or the bourgeoisie. 

# The Workers' Militia and Its Opponents
All socialists should say to the people that the idea of a united front opens possibilities, but isn't a solution by itself. The only solution is the struggle of the masses, and if the united front prevents the masses from entering into struggle, then it is worse than useless. 

It is obvious that a workers' militia is needed. There needs to be an organized fighting force of the working class. However, a correct policy is also needed in the battle. 

The correct formation of this militia is grouped by workplace, so that the fighters intimately know their comrades and can prevent infiltration very easily. 

# The Perspective in the United States
The [[USA|American]] working class is not lacking in development, or in combativeness. It is lacking in social analysis and spirit of generalization that could unite ALL workers. 

Without a wave of radicalism, and a revolutionary situation, there can be no rise of fascism. Therefore, what we should expect in the US is not a rising tide of fascism, but a rising tide of revolution. 

During WW2, the US government resembled a military dictatorship. However, this wasn't fascism. It was based on nothing but the disorientation of the masses, and their submission. After time, this regime would dissolve because it didn't really have a social base of support. 

# Build the Revolutionary Party!
Fascism was only ever sucessful in places where a revolutionary situation emerged, and some force or another prevented the workers from taking advantage and seizing power. Therefore, the best defense against fascism is the development of a strong leadership of the working class which would prevent such a situation from happening.
