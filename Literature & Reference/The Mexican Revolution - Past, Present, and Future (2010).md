> This is an article from *In Defense of Marxism,* about the history of revolution in [[Mexico]]. 

Woods begins by noting that this article was written 100 years after the beginning of the Mexican revolution, on November 20th 1910. He remarks that the conditions are now ripe for another revolution, with a mighty [[proletariat]] at its head.

Woods explains that for most of its history, Mexico had a striking gap between rich and poor. He says that under the regime of General Diaz, this gap grew ever wider. 

Outlining the liberal resistance to Diaz, Woods introduces Madero, who he says represented the liberal [[bourgeoisie]]. However, Woods assures us that the real force behind the revolution came from below, from the infant Mexican working class. 

It was the first shaky steps of this class, Woods claims, in the form of strikes, that forced Diaz to hold elections in 1910. Of course, Woods remarks, Diaz only felt comfortable doing this because he threw his main opponent, Madero, in prison so he couldn't run.

Woods outlines how Madero fled prison and called for a national uprising against Diaz in the face of the electoral fraud. Woods explains that in order for this uprising to succeed, it had to be linked with the main motor force behind the bourgeois-democratic revolution, the [[peasantry]]. 

Woods introduces [[Pancho Villa]] in the north, and [[Emiliano Zapata]] in the south, who he says led the peasants in guerella war. 

> [!Criticism]
> A rare Alan Woods criticism! He just said that the Mexican working class was the force behind the Mexican revolution, and then he contradicted himself by saying it was really the peasantry.

## The permanent revolution
Woods brings up the concept of [[permanent revolution]], elucidated by [[Trotsky]], saying that it's the only way to really understand the Mexican revolution. 

Woods explains the theory, stating that its essence is that the imperialist bourgeoisie and the national borgeoisie of colonial countries are *incapable* of carrying out the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. 

Woods elaborates, claiming that this is because the national capitalist class is too linked with international [[capital]]. 

Comparing the situation to the one faced in [[Russia]], Woods says in these situations the tasks of national liberation fall to the proletariat, who cannot stop at the tasks of bourgeois revolution, and must immediatley pass forward to the tasks of a socialist revolution - the expropriation of the bourgeoisie and the establishment of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]. 

Woods says that the weakness of the Mexican revolution lay in its class base in the peasantry. He says that the peasantry in Mexico was strong enough to overthrow the existing order, but not strong enough to fill the vaccum left behind. Drawing parallels to other peasant uprisings, Woods argues that this is a historical law of the peasantry, it is unable to play an independent role as the ruling class. 

In order to explain why this is, Woods turns to an economic analysis of the peasantry. He says that since the peasants are more a group of individuals than a bound-together class, they are easily decieved and manipulated by the bourgeoisie. 

Woods emphasizes that the peasantry is not weak. In fact, he says it is an effective battering ram when weiled by the bourgeoise, and it was this ram that disloged General Diaz and forced him to flee to [[France]] in 1911. 

Woods explains that this was how Madero (who Woods calls the Mexican [[Kerensky]]) rose to power in Mexico. But Woods says that Madero was unable to calm the peasants after their role was over. According to Woods, Emiliano Zapata continued to lead the peasants in their struggle for freedom. 

## A revolutionary war
Woods tells us that as soon as Madero had gained power, he had lost it again, and was executed by reactionary military officers. Woods says this sparked another round of the peasant uprising, which wiped out the remnants of the old military apparatus. 

Woods praises Zapata for taking advantage of the situation and moving to take power in the state of Morelos, where he carried out a revolutionary agrarian reform. Woods says that Zapata drove out the landowners and redistributed land, mainly using guerella tactics.

Woods contrasts this with the peasant struggle in the north, led by Poncho Villa, which he says was more organized and army-like. Woods says that both these forces were well organized and effective because they were fighting a revolutionary struggle against their oppressors, a point that Woods says is often forgotten in bourgeois histories.

The author elaborates that the most decisive role in the revolution was played by the poorest layers who had been roused by the possibility of freedom. Woods says that these people inflicted one defeat after another on the well-equipped and well-trained forces of the state. 

Generalizing the experience of revolutionary wars, Woods claims that when the people are inspired to sacrifice for a just cause, they can punch above their weight against militaries whose troops are often motivated by self-preservation alone. 

With all these facts laid out, Woods argues that a complete social revolution could have been on the agenda for Mexico, if only they had one missing factor accounted for. He attributes the fatal error to the absence of a party like [[Bolsheviks]]. He says that the revolutionary leadership that the Bolsheviks provided was able to finish the revolution that the workers and peasants started. 

Woods says that because of the lack of such a leadership, the bourgeoisie was able to use the energy created by the workers and peasants to ride back into power, where they immediatley set to work preparing the betrayal of the peasants. 

Woods explains that the upper stratum of the Mexican bourgeoisie was terrified that the land reforms being carried out by the peasantry might only be a prelude to a total assault on private property itself, and decided to put a stop to it entirely. 

The author says that their first act was to assasinate Zapata, which they succeded in doing in 1919. 

## Bonapartism
Explaining the atomization of the peasant movement in the south after the murder of Zapata, Woods says that Zapata hadn't formed a homogenous party that could act as a unifying force. Instead, we are told that Zapata was holding the movement together by personal force and charisma alone. 

Woods calls attention to the fact that the peasant movement splintered into many factions after Zapata's death, and says that the fate of the Mexican revolution was now going to be decided by other classes. 

After the disintegration of any centralized peasant movement, Woods describes a country plunged into chaos and directionless violence. He says that isolated guerella units roamed the countryside, indistinguishable from mere bandits. 

In order to restore order, Woods observes that the bourgeoisie, under Carranza, carried out its own land reform. He explains that this measure pacified the peasantry at last, even though it was really a victory of the bourgeoise. 

However, Woods remarks that the bourgeoisie weren't home free yet. He says they had to rely on the balancing act of [[Bonapartism]] to maintain power, where the bourgeoisie made every effort to mask their counter-revolution in the garb of revolution itself. 

Woods calls attention to the skillful work of the PRI (The Revolutionary Institutional Party) which he says was the political instrument of the bourgeoisie. He comments that the PRI had a left wing which was used to lean on the workers and peasants to serve the interests of the Mexican national bourgeoise. In this way, Woods argues, the PRI was able to maintain stability for generations.

It was a representative of this left wing, Woods remarks, that invited [[Trotsky]] to stay in Mexico after his exile from the USSR. This man, Cardenas, Woods argues, was a genuine revolutionary democrat who nationalized the oil industry in 1938. 

Woods explains that Cardenas, who was a bourgeois revolutionary through and through, still went quite far in his struggle against [[imperialism]], which earned him Trotsky's praise. Woods says that it was this anti-imperialist struggle that earned the PRI the support from the working class that it enjoyed up until quite recently, when a new period in Mexican history opened. 

## The heritage we defend
Woods defends the positive characteristics of the Mecian revolution of 1910-20, which he says partially adressed the land question, and laid the basis for the development of a strong Mexican working class. However, he says the revolution remained incomplete. 

Woods attributes this incompleteness to the lack of a strong revolutionary leadership based in the working class. He says that the immaturity of the Mexican working class was reflected in its tendency towards [[Anarchism]]. Woods claims that the anarchists demonstrated their usual confusion towards the bourgeois-democratic movement. 

Woods now turns to the current situation in Mexico. He points to the strong working class, and emphasizes the need for a revolutionary party to channel the immense power of this class. 

The author claims that this was demonstrated in 2006, when the masses came out in support of Obrador, the left-wing PRD candidate. He says that the bourgeoisie took the dramatic step of rigging the elections against him, causing massive protests and occupations.

Woods explains that this would have been an excellent opportunity for a revolutionary leadership to win the support of the masses, but says that none existed and the movement fizzled. 

Bringing in the global situation that capitalism find itself in, Woods says that the Mexican bourgeoisie and its political representatives has no choice but to attack the living standards of Mexican workers. He says this is bound to provoke class conflict.

Woods also mentions that a new Mexican revolution wouldn't stop at the Rio Grande. He says that such an upheaval would be bound to affect the [[USA]], and that the border controls that are now a feature of the US southern border would be powerless to stop the revolutionary sentiments from sweeping the country. 

Woods says that the [[USA|American]] imperialists are terrified of such an event, and that this fear is evident in the US response to events in [[Venezuela]] and elsewhere.
