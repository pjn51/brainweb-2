> This is an article hosted on Cosomnaut, arguing that the [[Labour Party (UK)]] is not a vehicle for working class emancipation. Overall, I think it makes some quite bad arguments and is very politically confused as to the relationship Marxists take to the workers' movement generally. 

## Regroupment on the left
The author, Hancox, describes his view of the post-Corbyn atmosphere on the [[UK]] left. He says that a defining feature of the Labour left revival was the draining of activist energy, the collective biting of tongues when Labour lurched right, and perpetual compromises by Corbyn. 

Hancox says that now, a year lafter Labours return to Blairism, the left remains focused on parliamentary manuvering. He argues that there has been worryingly little opposition to the Tories. 

Hancox gives an overview of what he sees as shakeups within the radical left milieu. He highlights the exodus from the [[SWP (UK)]], and [[SPEW]], as well as smaller splits over LBGT attitudes and transphobia.

The author says that these shakeups have led to networks of younger, more progressive socialists who are dedicated to internal democracy and disillusioned with the "monomania of electoral ultimatums." 

Hancox describes what he sees as the new wave of leftist groups, which he sees as based on different lines than the "old sectarian divisions" inherited from Cold War politics.

The author says that in the immediate term, there is a need to crystallize a movement, rather than endlessly seek diplomatic fronts with [[reformism|reformists]]. 

However, Hancox also criticizes attempts to create sterile vanguard parties based on ideological unity rather than mass roots, saying that such attempts will simply breed [[sectarianism]]. 

Hancox praises [[Marxist Center]] for bringing together many tendencies in North America, and hopes that the embryonic British Marxist Centre could play the same role. At the same time, he criticizes the Marxist Center for focusing too much on [[mutual aid|base building]]. 

The author asserts that any attempt of constructing socialist unity must aim to achieve practical unity wherever possible, while maintaining political tension and disagreements openly. 

Saying that we find ourselves at a historical flashpoint of world capitalism, the author says we must re-establish an orientation towards building "counter-power" and planting deep roots in the working class rather than hedging our bets on the next election cycle. 

Hancox says that we need conceptual clarity on the rile that the "left-wing of [[reformism]]" plays. He says that likewise, we must avoid the tempation of viewing community organizing as an escape route from "the pitfalls of gradualism and opportunism." By this, the author is critiquing the Marxist Center and the strategy of base-building.

He says that "political lines of demarcation" are still needed, or else he thinks we risk turning into just another avenue of "front work for reformist politicians." He thinks that the [[DSA]] has this issue. 

> [!note]
> So far, I don't detect anything totally incorrect. There are some warning signs though. The author seems to equate any electoral activity whatsoever with either selling out to reformism, or short-term obsession with "the next election."
> 
> I think this line of thinking will be developed soon, and hopefully there will be more nuance. 

## The terminal sickness of Labourism
The author claims that the energy poured into Labour by the left felt necessary, but only because of the sorry state of leftist organizing outside the Labour Party. He says that the left in Britain lacks any sembalnce of political power or organizational method. 

Hancox says that the wave of anti-austerity sentiment that pushed Corbyn to prominence ended up being redirected and diffused through electoralism. 

Hancox says that even after the defeat of the Corbyn wave, the "myopic obsession with parliamentary activity" continues, and he implicates the UK section of the [[IMT]] (Socialist Appeal). 

The author argues that the supposedly prevailing view, that we must not criticize Corbynism for fear of strengthening the Labour right, is playing a negative role. He says that these people assume that the end goal of a 'socialist' Labour government justifies violating the principle of [[class independence]] and other self-defeating tactics. 

Hancox claims that the Labour Party has never been a centrist party like the USPD (the offshoot of the German [[SPD]] that emerged to counter the former's rabid [[imperialism]]). He says that [[Lenin]] classified the Labour party as bourgeois because "although made up of workers, it is led by reactionaries." 

Anticipating counter-arguments, Hancox brings up the lessons of [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]]. He says that leftists often generalize the advice that we should participate in conservative trade [[unions]] to mean that we should also particiapte in reformist poltical parties. Hancox says that trade union officials are one step removed from the class struggle, and can be forced left by the rank-and-file. In supposed contrast to this, Hancox says that the Labour Party is twice removed from the class struggle at the point of production.

> [!Criticism]
> This seems like quite a hair-splitting difference here. He really needs to justify that one additional level of separation results in a total qualitative change between a reactionary union bureaucrat and a Labour politician.

The author claims that Labour has traditionally attempted to mediate between the conservative trade union bureaucracy and the bourgeois state, and that the Labour left is umbilically tied to the right through nationalism, legalism, and class collaboration.

Citing a few examples of individual socialists becoming less radical after election through Labour, Hancox argues that this means that the Labour Party can never be used by revolutionaries as a tool. 

The author brings up the fact that Lenin explicitly said that the [[CPGB]] ought to affiliate with Labour in 1920. However, Hancox asserts that Labour is no longer a flexible federation that allowed for revolutionaries to have enough freedom of criticism within it. The author says that it was only under these specific conditions that Lenin advocated for the Communists to align with the Labour party, and that the Leninists went on to submerge their key political differences in order to secure alliances with reformists in Labour. 

Hancox now turns to Trotsky, who he says elaborated on the state of Labour after Lenin's death. 

> Trotsky was able to pinpoint how Labour lefts ‘reflect the lethargy of the British working class’, converting workers’ emancipatory aspirations into ‘left phrases of opposition’ that place no real obligations on the pro-capitalist reformers. He explained that the Labour left functions as ‘a sort of safety valve for the radical mood of the masses’, by channelling ‘the political feebleness of the awakening masses into an ideological mish-mash.'

> [!criticism]
> In order for this argument to make sense, the author must explain how, by abstaining from participation in the left wing of Labour, this 'safety valve' can be closed. I agree that reformism does act as a safety valve, but this is a simplistic conception.
> 
> Should Marxists not attempt to win the leadership of the leftward moving workers in Labour? Should we cede the leadership of the working class in general to these reformists? 
> 
> Furthermore, the author is confused about the nature and viability of reformism in general. Reformism can only act as a safety valve if the reformists can deliver reforms. In an era of contracting profits, this is simply not possible on any scale large enough to diffuse the anger of the workers. 

Hancox asserts that the CPGB refused to criticize Labour in the 20s in order to maintain its connections with the Labour lefts, but were purged from the party by these same Labour lefts later on. 

The author again cites Trotsky's analysis that the Labour left was more dangerous than the right due to the former's ability to decieve workers. At this point, Hancox takes a more critical view of Trotsky, who he says became more confused after his break with the [[Comintern]]. Hancox says that Trotsky began to claim that Labour was a [[workers' party]] that should be supported because it represented the working class. 

The author claims that both Lenin and Trotsky harbored 'millenarian' expectations that a general crisis of capitalism would spell the demise of reformism. The author says that this is a ludricous statement that has been seized upon by people such as [[Rob Sewell]]. 

The author claims that Trotskyists such as Sewell selectively ignore all of Trotsky's polemics on "when to leave reformist organizations and of the opportunism of those who did not." 

> [!criticism]
> This 'millenarian' attitude is nothing but authentic Marxist economics. If the author believes that a crisis of capitalism will never make reforms impossible and therefore spell the end of popular reformism, what is his conception of revolution? Does the author think that all the workers will suddenly walk away from reforms and instead take up arms against the state? Why would workers abandon reformism if it was possibly to make gains in the struggle without risking life and limb, and without even going to the streets?
> 
> Furthermore, if this statement is so ludicrous, why not explain why? The author simply moves on to other things. If Trotsky wrote polemics on when to leave reformist organizations, why not cite them?

Hancox argues that the "lack of conceptual clarity" on the left about reformism has clouded the waters about the true role of the left wing of Labour. Again attacking Socialist Appeal, the author claims that Socialist Appeal says that there is a Marxist left in Labour that should be defended. 

Criticizing this position, the author declares that this left current has been downright counter-revolutionary. For evidence of this, he cites some events where Labour crushed strikes when in power. 

The author cites Miliband, who observed that "people on the left who have set out with the intention to transform the Labour Party have more often than not ended up being transformed by it." Supporting this, he claims that the post-war Communist Party dropped their revolutionary demands in order to seek progressive parliamentary coalitions. 

Hancox also discusses the case of [[Militant]]. He says that they pursued a 'legal revolution' through nationalization, and that their tactics centered on [[entryism]]. 

Turning to entryism directly, Hancox argues that it was born in the 30s as a response to the weakness of Trotskyism internationally, and that it was only meant to be a temporary measure. 

Returning to a critique of Militant, the author claims that through a process of deep entryism, Militant became indistinguishable from the Labour left, and ended up "condemning oppressed communities fighting the police and army in the north of [[Ireland]] and Britain's inner cities." The author attributes these positions to a servile attitude towards bourgeois legalism.

The author says that a "more subtle approach" was taken by the [[SWP (UK)]]. He says that the adopted an "open party" perspective that theoretically maintained their independence. However, he criticizes the SWP's 'obsession' with workers' self activity. He says that this fixation prevented the SWP from admitting to the existance of poltical problems related to "the hold that Labourism had over the workers." He also says that the SWP had a tendency to gloss over political disagreements and join with reformists in broad fronts, and the author ties this behavior to a pattern he sees with the [[PSL]] working with [[DSA]]. Likewise, the author says that the leadership of the [[Marxist Center]] in the US complains that local organizations tend not to confront DSA directly. 

The author admits that there is still a need to have socialists engaged with mass reformist organizations, but says that any engagement must be directed towards crystalizing "an unofficial Left Wing movement opposed to the social-democratic opportunism of the scab 'soft' left leaders like Corbyn and McDonnell."

> [!criticism]
> The author complains that others are confused about reformism, but he is really the one confused. He says on one hand that any support to the left wing of Labour is tantamount to selling out to the bourgeoisie, and then turns around and says that we should put our efforts towards the crystalization of a Left Wing in Labour.
> 
> He criticizes Socialist Appeal for supposedly worshiping Corbyn, but fails to see that the main line of Socialist Appeal is to criticize the Labour leaders just as he recommends that we do.

## Five wasted years
Hancox criticizes Corbyn's supposed radicalism, and points to examples of Corbyn and McDonnell advocating for demands that other capitalist countries have seen, such as a unified state-owned central bank.

The author claims that every time a left wing has been reinvigorated, it has played the role of drawing radicals back into the party's orbit.

> [!criticism]
> If the left wing plays a negative role when it is reinvigorated, then why do you recommend that socialists work on creating a Left Wing in labour?

The author criticizes Socialist Appeal for their stance that Corbyn's biggest mistake was not purging the Labour Party of right-wing elements when he was in power. The author says that Corbyn didn't have the means or disposition to do this.

> [!criticism]
> Has Hancox heard of [[positive demands]]? By calling on Corbyn to purge the right wing of Labour, we can allow the workers to see that a candidate with a spine is needed. 

The author admits that the "soft left" should still be defended against the Tories, and quotes Trotsky as saying that the ruling class' real fear is that proletarian anger lies behind the visage of the reformists. However, Hancox proclaims that we shouldn't cover for the opportunistic vaccilation of the left wing leaders of Labour. 

The author admits that anti-electoralism shouldn't be made into a dogma, and that electoral work is still useful from an agitational perspective. However, he says that for this agitational work to succeed, the socialists need their own infrastructure outside of the electoral arena. 

## Counter-power and the long revolution
The author says that the economic conditions that enabled the golden era of reformism are gone, but reformist consciousness doesn't mechanically disappear. 

Turning to [[fascism]], the author states that fascism is 'still in the third or fourth stage away,' and then moves past the subject entirely to discuss the need to build a vanguard of the working class. 

> [!cricitism]
> I'm not even going to get into the whole fascism thing with Hancox. Of course he has confused ideas about fascism's possibility in developed capitalist countries.

The author recommends that we work towards developing a culture and infrastructure of working-class resistance instead of being fixated on short-term electoralism in the Labour Party.

Hancox says this sorts of infrastructure is an avenue for building [[dual power]] in the UK. 

Referring to the various 'Leninist' parties in the UK, Hancox says they find themselves in a peculiar situation of "Bolsheviks without soviets."

> [!criticism]
> This is a totally inaccurate comparison. First of all, the Bolsheviks didn't set up the soviets. The soviets developed *during* the revolution, not slowly piece by piece by socialists. Second of all, there *are* mass organizations in the UK! Just because their leaders are reformist is no excuse to get rid of them and start over! Thirdly, there is no powerful heir to the Bolsheviks in the UK, except maybe Socialist Appeal, who Hancox casts aside as having Corbyn-mania. 

Hancox argues that we cannot rely on Labour itself to act as a tool capable of attacking the state, since once in power it will be subject to strong bourgeois impulses. 

The author proclaims the need for a general revolutionary (not broad left) organization nationally, and says that this means we need an independent workers' party. 

> [!criticism]
> Hancox is confusing the role of a revolutionary party and a mass workers' party here. 

The author salues the US Marxist Center for avoiding "[[sectarianism]]" by refusing to create any sort of unified political "shibboleth" around Marxism-Leninism or [[Trotskyism]], and preferring to prioritize internal democracy and the building of working-class power independently of the [[bourgeoisie]].

> [!criticism]
> If the "Marxist" Center has no "shibboleth," does this apply to Marxism as well? If not, then this argument falls apart and the real argument is that we should just have a correct shibboleth.
> 
> And if it does apply to Marxism, how is this any different from the Labour Party? Inevitably, in times of calm, reformists and centrists would come to dominate it, restarting this whole damn process.
