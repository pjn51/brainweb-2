# Summary
This theory, written by [[Trotsky]], came just after the 1905 revolution in [[Russia]]. He discusses the idea that [[Social development is always uneven]] and fleshes out the theory of [[combined and uneven development]]. 

# Introduction
Marxists, the only ones to predict the events of 1905 in theory, pointed out that the revolution was bourgeois, and thus the immediate aims of the revolution were the creation of conditions for [[capitalism]] to develop. 

# 1. The peculiarities of Russian historical development
The slugishness of Russian productive development, caused by natural factors such as geography and low population density, led to sluggish class development when compared to Western Europe. 

However, Russia did not exist in a vaccum. As the Russian [[state|state]] bumped up against the stronger states to the west, it had two paths laid out in front of it: it could crumble under the external pressure, or it could begin to frantically develop itself in order to survive. Since the Russian economy was strong enough to prevent the first option, the Russian state began to rapidly entrench itself under the external pressure. 

*note: this same process happened when Imperial Japan made contact with the capitalist world for the first time.*

Because the state was so desperate to expand, it began to seize a larger and larger portion of the [[surplus value]] of Russian society for defensive purposes. This began to slow down the productive development of Russia even more. 

Since the productive forces were not developing organically fast enough, the state took these matters into its own hands. It accelerated the social estates that developed in the Middle Ages in Europe, while trying to subject these estates to state interests. At the same time, the new classes being formed sought to use the state in the way that they did in Western Europe. However, the Russian state had more leverage than the mideval states of Europe had had, and was able to subjugate the developing upper classes. 

So it thus appeared that capitalism had been a creation of the Russian state. This is a one-sided view. The Russian state could only accelerate the organic processes already happening in Russia. 

The result of this whole process was that compared to European societies at a similar point in their history, the Russian state was very strong in relation to the forces of bourgeois revolution. While Russian forces were unable to stand up to European ones, they were plently strong enough to repress.

While this delayed the transition to bourgeois democracy, it also firmly shut the doors to a peaceful transition to parlaimentarianism. The Russian revolution, however late, was now guaranteed. 

# 2. The towns and capital
The urban population was skyrocketing during the expansion of the Russian state apparatus. The quantity, but also the quality of the urban centers was changing. They were moving from an appendage of the state, whose residents almost entierly worked for the state, to centers of commerce and industry. 

Trotsky pays attention to the fact that the European peasant craftworkers formed the basis of the beginnings of the factory system, but in Russia this was not the case whatsoever. He says that instead, large-scale capitalist industry took over right from the start in the cities. 

Trotsky says that the defining economic role of the town is to work on raw material supplied by the countryside. To him, this means that the growth of transportation networks is essential to support the growth of the towns, as more and more raw material is needed. He says that this growth of the towns is needed due to the need to concentrate the workforce for capitalist production. 

Trotsky says that the industrial factory system gives rise to the proletariat, and cuts the ground from under the feet of bourgeois democracy, since it erodes the class of petty bourgeois that bourgeois democratic movements rely upon. He also calls attention to the foreign nature of Russian [[capital]], saying that this impeded the growth of bourgeois movements in Russia, while making the proletariat more important. 

Trotsky explains how capitalism did not develop from within Russia, but invaded Russia from Europe, with all of European development and culture behind it. He says that this made Russia a giant gambling hall for European speculation, with massive profits leaving the country all the time. 

In Trotsky's view, this meant that [[capital]] was able to "project its main branches of production and methods of communication" past all the intermediate stages of deveopment that it had to go through in Europe. He says that the fewer obstacles [[capital]] met with in the path of its economic domination, the more insignificant proved to be its political role.

> By this, I think he means that since capitalists didn't have to go up against the state in order to dominate the economy, they never played a progressive role politically, or any political role at all really. 

# 3. 1789 - 1848 - 1905
Trotsky says that each wave of revolution is unique, and that the revolutions of 1848 in Prussia and Austria were much less extensive than the French revolution of 1789. 

The author says that the "gigantic exertion of strength" needed to carry through a bourgeois revolution against absolutism is only possible through one of two ways. He outlines the first as the rising of the whole nation against despotism, and the second as the intensification of the class struggle within the nation. 

Trotsky says we can look to 1789 to see an example of the first avenue. He says that the national energy was compressed enough by the suffocating resistance of the old order for the situation to become revolutionary. 

The author says that the second avenue has never occured, and is only theoretical, but that the energy needed is generated through the friction of class struggle within a bourgeois nation. Trotsky outlines this process: the proletariat is given many years of experience in a matter of months, and is handed the reins of power and is able to set a new course. 

Between these two avenues, Trotsky places the revolutions of 1848. He says they were too late to use a united 'people' for the overthrow of the old order, but too early to have the class struggle play a decisive role. 

Trotsky outlines the process by which the leadership of the various waves of the French revolution developed. He says that the bourgeoisie stepped up to the task, and the conservative layers were thrown off again and again by the inertia of events, each time ushering in a new layer of bourgeois leadership. 

As for Jacobinism, Trotsky says that the communist movement has criticized Jacobin ideas as utopian, but defends them from the bourgeois' attacks on the revolutionary nature of these ideas. 

Turning now to 1848, Trotsky says the bourgeoisie was unable to play the kind of role it had in 1789. He says that it was unable and unwilling to undertake the liquidatoin of the old social system, and it preferred to merely share power with the old order. Trotsky points out that this meant the revolution had to be carried out, not *by* the bourgeoisie, but *against* them. To him, this indicated that a class war was needed for a full revolution. 

Unfortunately, Trotsky points out that neither the petty bourgeois nor the peasantry was prepared to lead such a class war. He says that the proletariat was far too weak, lacking in organization and knowledge. 

Trotsky calls our attention to the plight of the Viennese proletariat during 1848. He says that the leadership of their struggle fell to the democratic students, who were unable to provide the needed clarity for victory. 

Trotsky explains that from the events in Germany and Hungary, Lasalle drew the conclusion that only a "purely socialistic"
revolution was possible. Trotsky elaborates on this conclusion by saying that only a strong proletarian revolution could succeed. 

Trotsky asserts that the Russian working class is far more mature than the prior examples, and supports this by mentioning the organic formation of the Soviets in 1905. 

Trotsky outlines how the demand for an armed militia was a classic demand of all the bourgeois revolutions, since the arming of the bourgeoisie assured the end of absolutism and also worked to safeguard bourgeois property relations. He notes that it is peculiar that the Russian bourgeois parties made no such demands. 

Trotsky thinks this is because the Russian liberals see no way to create an armed force outside of and against the proletariat. Knowing that creating an armed force means arming the workers, Trotsky theorizes that the liberals would rather surrender to absolutism and the Tsar. 

Because of this, Trotsky asserts that the arming of the workers, and thus the fate of the revolution itself, falls to the proletariat. 


# 4. Revolution and the proletariat
Trotsky begins by defining revolution as an open measurement of strength between social forces in a struggle for power. He says that this struggle is not over the state as an end in itself, since he believes the state is merely a tool in the hands of whichever class dominates society. 

However, Trotsky thinks the state can be a tremendous tool for organizing social relations, and says that any political party worth its salt seeks to capture political power for whichever class it represents. 

Trotsky explains that the workers become more and more powerful as capitalism develops, but this doesn't mean the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is automatically achieved due to advances in the productive forces. Instead, he thinks that victory is dependent on a combination of factors, including the international situation, the traditions, the initiative, and the readiness of the workers to fight. 

To support this, Trotsky highlights the times that workers have seized power (temporarily) in less developed countries rather than the most developed. 

Trotsky says that this means the workers in Russia will get a chance to secure power *before* the liberals "display to the full their talent for governing."

Trotsky introduces a quote from [[Marx]], that he believes some have mis-interpreted, which says that the workers in Germany cannot take power until the national bourgeoisie is developed, since the workers and the bourgeoisie grow more powerful due to the same process of economic development. 

> Marxism is above all a method of analysis – not analysis of texts, but analysis of social relations.

Trotsky expands on this by asking if Russian conditions align with Marx's analysis of the German workers. He says that simply to pose the question reveals that there's a hopeless formalism in the minds of those who try and apply German 1840s conclusions to Russian 1900s conditions. 

Comparing Russia and the [[USA]], Trotsky outlines that Russian industry is much less developed. However, he tells us that the relationship between capitalist develop and proletarian strength is not direct, and that the [[USA|American]] proletariat is much weaker politically than the Russian one, because national and international political factors can cut across the relationship of economic development to proletarian development. 

Trotsky quotes [[Kautsky]] who he says agrees with him on this point. 

Due to this, Trotsky believes that the class struggle in Russia now boils down to a battle between Tsarism and the industrial proletariat. Because of this, he concludes that the proletariat is in a better position to take power than the national bourgeoisie is. 

Trotsky explains that there are two forms of political optimism. According to him, we can either exaggerate our strength and try make moves that don't correlate to the balance of forces, or we can optimistically set our sights high and then be realistic about the immediate situation. 

He says that we could demand that the coming revolution in Russia be bourgeois, or we could insist that power would only be in the hands of the workers for a transitory period, but he says both these predictions would be false. 

Trotsky brings up the claims that Russia isn't ready for socialism, and asks us a question:

> Is it inevitable that the proletarian dictatorship should be shattered against the barriers of the bourgeois revolution, or is it possible that in the given world-historical conditions, it may discover before it the prospect of victory on breaking through these barriers?

# 5. The proletariat in power and the peasantry
Trotsky begins by asserting that in the event of a victory of the revolution, power would pass into the hands of the class that played a leading role in the struggle. In other words, the proletariat would gain state power. This would not preclude the proletariat from sharing power with other classes such as the urban petty bourgeois, the intellectuals, or the peasantry, but Trotsky notes that there's a difference between workers holding state power and workers' representatives entering into bourgeois government coalitions "in the capacity of more or less honored hostages."

Trotsky says that while the policy and standpoint of the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat are defined, the intellectuals, the urban petty bourgeois, and the peasantry could end up in multiple positions or sides of the barricade, and therefore these strata could be part of the post-revolutionary ruling government.

Trotsky asks us to consider how a "revolutionary democratic government" would even function without representatives of the working class. The refusal of social-democrats to participate in the government would doom it. However, we should bank on the participation of the proletariat within such a government. 

Therefore, Trotsky continues, we can call this new government whatever we want - "dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry," or something else, but we should really consider the balance of power within such a government. Trotsky asserts that the hegemony should belong to the working class. 

Relating this to the [[France|French]] revolution, Trotsky says that the National Convention was an organ of Jacobin dictatorship. However, it didn't contain only Jacobins, and the Jacobins were actually a minority within it. It was the pressure from the *sansculottes* that ensured the power of the Jacobins. 

Trotsky now turns to what we may expect just after the urban proletariat "stand at the helm of the state." We should expect the urban proletariat, seeking to secure their gains, widen the social base of the revolution to include rural workers, peasants, and whoever they can attract to their side. They will likely agitate and organize using state resources. This will affect the relationship between the workers and the peasants. 

Trotsky returns to the revolutions of 1789-93 and 1848, looking for examples of how the peasantry behaved. Power first passed from the aristocracy to the "moderate" bourgeoisie, who emancipated the peasantry. Then, the peasantry lost all interest in the progress of the revolution, siding instead with the forces of counter-revolution before revolutionary democracy was even on the agenda.
