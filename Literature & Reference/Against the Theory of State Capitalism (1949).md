> [[Cliff called the USSR state capitalist]], and Grant is refuting that here. They were representatives of different [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] currents in the [[UK]] at the time.

Grant begins his critique of Cliff's theory of state capitalism by noting that Cliff's practical stance on the [[Russia|USSR]] doesn't really emerge from his analysis. I think this is pretty severe, since the only reason we theorize about the nature of things is to draw practical conclusions. [[Abstractions should be useful]]! 

Grant explains that since [[Classes arise due to the needs of production]], Cliff ought to put forward the case for why a new capitalist class in the USSR arising would enhance production, but he does not. 

The author also says that Cliff's effort to draw a dividing line between pre and post-1928 Russia is in vain, since the economic system has the same fundamental basis since the revolution in 1917.

# Incorrect usage of quotations
Grant argues that Cliff has warped [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]]'s quotes and taken him out of context, replying with a quote by Trotsky that clearly shows that [[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]]. 

# Can there be a struggle between two sections of the same class? French revolution - Russian revolution
Grant explains that we can use the French Revolution and the Napoleonic counter-revolution as an example here, where the counter revolution still proceeded on the basis of a new form of production, [[capitalism]]. Despite its reactionary character, Grant says, Stalin (like Napoleon), was compelled to proceed on the basis of a new productive system, the planned economy with the workers as ruling class. 

Continuing, Grant says that the bureaucracy was compelled to defend nationalized production and seek the aid of the [[proletariat]] in its struggle to survive, indicating that the latter were the ruling class still. 

# Does the law of value operate within the Russian economy?
Grant says that Cliff puts forward an incorrect idea: that the law of value is nowhere to be found in the internal economy of the USSR, and is only found in its external relationship with the capitalist countries. Grant argues that this is a departure from [[Marxism]], and that the law of value always expresses itself in the exchange of goods, in all past societies. 

In opposition to this view, Grant continues, Cliff sees the law of value expressed in competition between the USSR and the capitalist world, particularly in the arms race. Grant says that this is a concession to [[Shachtman]]'s theory of bureaucratic collectivism. 

Grant makes the point that even a healthy [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]] would require arms production, and that the fast tempo of arms production in the USSR doesn't reveal the nature of production itself. 

Coming to a contradiction in Cliff's argument, Grant points out how one one hand, Cliff accepts that the prices of Russian products are limited by the cost of production, and on the other hand he argues that the law of value is missing from internal Russian economics. 

Grant proposes that the law of value does play a role in Soviet economics, but argues that the conscious factor of planning plays an important moderating role, while under capitalism it acts blindly. He says that this is an important distinction that refutes the idea that the USSR is capitalist in any way, demonstrating that the USSR's economy is a transitional one between capitalism and [[socialism]]. 

# The role of money in Russia
Grant explains that Cliff (surprisingly) admits that the Soviet bureaucracy cannot arbitrarily increase or decrease the quantity of money, or change the prices of commodities arbitrarily. Grant cites Trotsky in [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]], who says that the laws of capitalist economy still hold but are modified during the transitional phase. He continues, saying that any attempt to consciously go beyond these laws results in "the domination of production over producer."

Grant says that there is indeed a transformation of [[currency|money]] into [[capital]] in the USSR. He says that the state, the sole employer, purchases [[labor|labor power]].  

# Was there surplus value before 1928? Cliff's arbitrary division
Grant says that at least Shachtman argues consistently that the law of value doesn't apply, and therefore none of the laws flowing from it apply in the USSR. As opposed to this, Grant says, Cliff admits the role of the law of value, but doesn't apply it systematically to both internal and external economic relations in the USSR. 

Turning to the question of [[surplus value]], Grant says that here is a contradiction: the end of capitalism in Russia, but the continuation of classes. The working class, he continues, still exists, even when it has abolished its national [[bourgeoisie]]. Grant also sees the continued extraction of surplus value from this proletariat, and says that it was not surplus *product* as Shachtman maintains. 

Grant asks Cliff how capitalism was *not* present in the USSR before 1928, and how it could appear afterwards, seeing as all the same forces were acting in the Soviet economy. He continues, explaining that even in a healthy workers' state, there are going to be some layers feeding on the surplus value, such as coordinators and specialists that oversee production. 
 
# The economcs of the transition from capitalism to socialism
Grant explains that [[Revolutions are messy]], and quirks of past development remain, at least for a period of time. Grant argues that [[Mode of production and appropriation are distinct]], and says that since the USSR doesn't have private appropriation, we cannot say that it is capitalist. Furthermore, he says, this is proved by the fact that the USSR is not subject to the same anarchic and blind laws that capitalist societies are. 

He highlights that [[Workers' states are contradictory]] - containing elements of both capitalist and socialist economy.

Grant cites [[Lenin]], who argued that [[Capitalism contains the seeds of socialist development]] in the movement towards centralization of production. He continues, saying that this is an indication of the ripeness of capitalism for revolution, and explains that the nationalization undertaken by a capitalist state doesn't qualify as socialism or a transition towards it, it is the beginning of a process which ends when [[Quantity transforms into quality]] and a revolution marks the final departure from capitalist property relations (19, 20). 

Grant says that society cannot step from capitalism to socialism overnight, or as he calls it, "from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." Instead, he says, there is a period where society has consciously recognized the economic laws, but is not yet strong enough to supercede those laws. He says this is an example of [[The dialectic of freedom and necessity]] and cites [[Hegel]] on the matter (20, 21). This is a really interesting concept to me - that there is a period in social development where we understand the laws that bind us, but must follow them regardless. It makes a lot of sense. 

Citing [[Marx]], Grant explains that the workers' state is semi-bourgeois in the sense that it must enforce bourgeois norms of law and distribution (23, 24). This just goes to support the idea that [[Workers' states are contradictory]] again. That's been a theme of this work. 

# The Marxian theory of the state. Two classes one state - Cliff's contradiction
Grant allows Cliff to explain himself: the latter says that Russia isn't a workers' state because by definition, a workers' state is one that is weilded by the workers. Cliff thinks that since Trotsky theorized that the workers must "purge" the Soviet state apparatus, this represents either an admsision that the USSR isn't a workers' state, or a break with the Marxist theory of the state (25). I don't think Trotsky is saying that a total destruction of the Soviet state is needed, and even if he was saying that, Cliff needs to distinguish between the need for a political revolution and a social one. Since the USSR was a workers' state, there was only the need for a political revolution - to replace the clique running the state machinery and the economy. 

Grant cites Cliff's argument that it was the introduction of the Five Year Plan that marked the counter-revolution that established state capitalism, saying that this contradicts his earlier argument that a smashing of the state is needed to change which class controls the state (26). 

Grant argues that since surplus value is needed to expand the means of production and the technical level, even a healthy workers' state would need to extract surplus value from the working class, and that the *historical purpose* of the working class is to generate surplus value (27). I agree, and I think that [[Labor will still be required after capitalism]] generally. 

# Nationalization and the workers' state
Diving into the basis for a workers' state, Grant argues that a state can be proletarian on the basis of political power, the economy, or both (29). I think this makes some sense in a [[dialectics|dialectical]] way. A state can either represent the political interests of the workers, or it can defend their economic interests, or both. Of course, a degenerating workers state that doesn't represent the political interests of workers will inevitably abandon their economic interests, and a state that represents their political interests will eventually carry that over into the economic sphere. 

# The dialectical conception of the state
Grant explains the basis of [[Bonapartism]], saying that "under certain conditions, the state gains a certain independence from the base which it originally represented," and even can come into conflict with that base for a period of time, such as Napoleon did for a period (32). This shows the flexibility of the Marxist method. We can analyze the economic foundations and basis of a state, but we can also recognize that the state can play an independent role during crisis. 

> The state is the instrument of class rule, or coercion, a glorified policeman. But the policeman is not the ruling class. The police can become unbridled, can become bandits, but that does not convert them into a capitalist, feudal or slave-owning class (37).

I think the above quote sums it up quite well, and it draws parallels to the [[June 2020 uprising]] in Seattle. The city council repeatedly attempted to hold the police back from their most brutal tactics, to no avail. Was Seattle a police-state during that period? No, the city was experiencing a crisis where the core of the state apparatus gained a degree of independence from the civilian leadership. 

# What happened in Eastern Europe
Grant outlines how the events of the Soviet advance into Eastern Europe reveal elements of contradiction. He says that as the Red Army advanced, it caused a wave of revolutionary uprising, factory seizures, etc, which the Soviet bureaucracy later suppressed. He says that this demonstrates the fact that the USSR was still a workers' state at its core, and not capitalist (37-38).

Explaining the general pattern of Stalinist betrayal in 1936 [[Spain]], the author notes that the bureaucracy made a deal with the "shadow of the bourgeoisie," since the real class had mainly fled and been scattered. In doing so, he says, they recreated the capitalist state which eventually defeated the revolutionary movement. Grant argues that a similar process occured in Eastern Europe, but the bureaucracy was compelled to carry out nationalization in order to secure their control over the situation (38). I think we can conclude that [[Stalinism is counter-revolutionary]]. 

Continuing the description of events, Grant says that the bureaucracy was compelled to call upon the masses to rise up, since [[Movements require mass action]] (40). 

Describing the specifics of political and social revolution, Grant says that a *political* revolution is distinct from a *social* one, and that the Russian masses completed a political revolution in February 1917, and were forced to carry out a social one in October 1917 and afterwards. He argues that just because there has been a political counter-revolution in the USSR doesn't mean that the social revolution has become undone (43). 

Returning to Bonapartism, Grant says that for a period in the emergence of capitalism, it served the needs of production to vest the power of the ruling class in the dictatorship of an individual, Napoleon. However, he continues, their autocracy eventually became a hinderance on production and the bourgeoisie was compelled to carry through a political revolution to replace them with bourgeois democracy. Grant argues that the USSR is going through a similar process, and that the USSR needs a political revolution to allow the further development of the economy and move towards socialism on a world scale (45).
