# Cargo Cult Science

[This speech](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm), made by scientist Richard [[Feynman]], deals with [[environmental science|the scientific method]] and pseudoscience. A fundamental messge is that [[Correlation doesn't require causation]]. 

We live in a society so used to the scientific method that it's hard to imagine a world where witch doctors were the main source of wisdom. However, many today still believe in really unscientific stuff like aliens or ESP. 

We shouldn't be too confident in things that seem scientific either. For example, many mainstream methods of teaching information don't produce any visible results in the test scores, which drop year after year. The same can be said about the criminal 'justice' system. 

The perfect example of this is the case of some tribe in the South Pacific. 

*Note: This sounds fake, but is a good analogy.*

This tribe saw that during [[WW2]], lots of planes with food and valuables would land on airstrips to resupply the troops on the islands. After the end of the war, these people wanted the planes to keep coming. In order to do this, they created their own airstrips, and created the impression of a whole small airport on their islands. However, the planes never came. 

This is the concept that Feynman calls "Cargo Cult Science." It has all the outer trappings of scientific inquiry, but is totally bullshit. The tribespeople saw that there were airstrips, and the planes landed on the airstrips. But it does not follow that wherever there are airstrips, there will be planes. Even though around the world, practically every time there are airstrips, there will be planes. 

The thing missing here is a sense of scientific integrity. When we perform an experiment, we should report everything that seems like it invalidates the experiment, not everything that supports the experiment. We should be desperate to *disprove* the hypothesis, not to prove it. 

When a theory is put together, it can't only explain the things that caused you to create the theory. It has to also explain other things you never knew about while thinking up the theory. Otherwise, you're putting the cart in front of the horse. 

In this way, science is the opposite of advertising. In advertising, selective facts are used to create a story. In good science, the scientist should be dragged kicking and screaming to any sort of straightforward narriative or rock-solid conclusion. 

Mainstream scientists fall into these kinds of traps too. When Millikan measured the charge of an electron, he got a number that was too low because of an error in the thickness of air. When other scientists repeated the experiment, they ruled out all the answers that were 'too high' above Millikan's by playing around with the numbers. In this way, the error persisted for a long time, only gradually improving. 

Therefore, the first principle in doing good science is not to fool yourself, and to remember that you are incredibly easy to fool. 

Another principle is not to fool the public. Scientists shouldn't try to make up reasons their research is important, they should just tell the truth. Additionally, scientists need to repeat experiments and validate each others' work, or else false conclusions will be taken as the truth. 

Scientists need to be trained to conduct experiments in a principled way, not just how to achieve results, the way that most scientific training is done in schools.
