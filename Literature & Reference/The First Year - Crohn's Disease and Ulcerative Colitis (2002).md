# Introduction
## How to use this book
The book is set up to be used by someone upon being diagnosed. It has chapters for each day, and then each week post-diagnosis. 

Each chapter is broken into a section on Living and one on Learning. Living is based on first hand experience of the author, for instance, how to survive the gross colonoscopy prep. The Learning section would dive deeper into why colonoscopies are needed, and what doctors are looking for. 

# Day 1
## Living: It's not your fault
There are multiple theories about the cause of CD. Genetics certainly plays a role, as the risk factor is 10x for someone with a family history of IBD. If a sibling or parent has CD, that risk factor jumps to 30x. 

Environmental factors are the other variable. Research has been done into the question of if too much, or not enough, bacteria can change the risk of developing CD. 

## Learning: What is IBD?
CD is named after Dr. Burrill Crohn, who wrote about CD along with other doctors in 1932. However, patients with similar symptoms go back to 1612. 

CD can affect areas along the entire digestive tract, from mouth to anus. Sores or lesions appear on the **mucosa**, the inner layer of the tract that absorbs nutrients. Inflammation of the other layers may occur. 

Secondary symptoms include kidney stones, gall stones, and swollen joints, along with eye problems and other things. 

### In whom do these cases occur?
CD is a disease of the developed world. Most cases come from industrialized countries in Europe and North America. 

The CCFA estimates that there are around 700,000 people with Crohn's in the US as of 2007. 30,000 are diagnosed each year. 

In terms of age onset, there is a bimodial distribution. Most cases are diagnosed in ages 15 - 35, and there is a smaller second peak in those aged 50 - 60. 

# Day 2
## Living: Grieving
This section is all about the stages of grief that people go through after a diagnosis. 

## Learning: What the tests tell us
### The normal digestive process
Food goes from the mouth, down the throat, and into the stomach. There, it is dissolved somewhat by digestive juices including acid, bile, and enzymes from the liver. 

Now liquid, the food passes through another sphincter and into the small intestine. The gallbladder releases more digestive juices, and the food starts to be absorbed through the intestinal membrane. Carbohydrates are absorbed early on, while fats and minerals are absorbed farther down the small intestine.

The point at which the small intestine connects with the large is called the **illeum**. As food passes from the small to the large intestine, also called the colon, the water and salts start to get sucked out of the food. After passing through the 6 feet of colon, the material (not really 'food' anymore...) is discharged out the anus. 

### What isn't normal?
People with CD have some fucked up shit happening instead of one part or another of this process. 

### How do doctors know it's IBD instead of something else?
It all depends on the sympotms you present. All the symptoms of CD are common to a whole range of problems, so it's a matter of narrowing it down over time through testing. 

Testing can consist of blood tests, fecal tests, endoscopies and colonoscopies to look for inflammation or lesions, 

# Day 3
## Living: Acceptance and hope
This section is all about how to find acceptance, how to maintain hope, and when and how to tell people in your life that you have CD.

## Learning: The workplace, the law, and IBD
### The ADA
IBD, and CD by extension, easily fit into the ADA definition of a disability. Even if CD doesn't "substantially limit a major life activity" all the time, it still counts if you have a record of it doing so at some point. 

Also, employers cannot descriminate because of their own *perception* of your impairment, even if you aren't actually impaired. For example, your boss can't transfer you to another position becuase he thinks you won't be able to handle the one you have, even if you can handle it. 

ADA protection begins the moment that your employer is made aware of the disability. This is why most employers don't ask about disabilities in job interviews. If they did, and didn't hire you after you told them you had CD, you could theoretically sue them for discrimination. 

If you do feel that you have been discriminated against, you should first look in your employees manual if you have one. You will probably find a way to adress issues in there. Submit, in writing, an explanation of the problem and provide suggestions for reasonable accomodations that could be made. Keep detailed notes on events that you feel are discriminatory. 

If your employer doesn't fix the problem, you can turn to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Be warned that it could take weeks or months for progress in their investigation. 

If even that doesn't work, you could contact an attorney. 

### The FMLA
The Family and Medical Leave Act covers some workers. It covers government employees, and employees in businesses that have more than 50 employees as long as the business is engaging in industry or commerce. 

There are more restrictions. The worker in question must have worked there for at least 12 months and 1,250 hours. 

If you fit all these restrictions, congratulations! You are entitled to 12 weeks of leave each year for medical reasons. However, you don't have to be paid for this time off. 

The only thing this really protects you from is being fired while in the hospital. If you're not in the 10% most highly salaried workers at the firm, your job is safe upon your return. 

# Day 4
## Living: Finding solace and support
This section deals with the importance of psychological support, and where you can get it - either in person at a support group, through therapy, or through online discussion boards. 

## Learning: How the disease works
### The inside view
The intestine is a very complex structure. The innermost part is the lumen, where the food is. Surrounding the lumen is the mucosa, which has the epithelium. The epithelium is made up of tiny fingerlike structures that extend into the lumen, through which nutrients are absorbed by the body. 

Underneath the epithelium are the crypts, where new epithelial cells are born and wait to replace dying epitleial cells. This area also has lots of immune defense cells to protect against invasion. 

Surrounding this system is the network of muscular and nerve cells called the muscularis. These muscles recieve signals from the brain that tell the muscles when to squeeze to move food down the intestinal tract and at what speed. 

Outside of this is the serosa, a protective layer that prevents bad bacteria or pathogens from getting into the intestinal area from other parts of the body. A rupture of this can lead to a deadly infection known as peritonitis.

### The inflammatory process
Inflammation in CD can occur in the mucosa, the muscularis, and occasionaly the serosa. Under normal conditions, intestinal inflammation happens when bacteria gets through the epithelium and is attacked by white blood cells that gather at the site of attack, causing the inflammation. With CD, the reason for the gathering of white blood cells is unclear. 

The white blood cells release chemical signals that cause blood vessels to dilate, bringing reinforcements. They also instruct the muscularis to spasm in order to move material faster past the site of inflammation which can cause cramping and spasms in some people. 

### The causes of the symptoms
Symptom | Cause
---|---
Fever|Immune response to bacterial attack or severe inflammation. Can be related to toxic megacolon
Abdominal pain|Swelling at site of inflammation, obstruction, or an abscess
Diarrhea|Failure of epithelium to remove liquid in colon, can be due to inflammation
Weight loss|Loss of appetite psychologically, problems absorbing nutrients
Fatigue / anemia|Result of extended discomfort / lack of red blood cells due to internal blood loss

# Day 5
## Living: Assembling your healthcare team
You are a member of the team, and your health is ultimatley up to you. Make sure that your team is composed of people who are really in a position to help you, and make sure that you understand all your options. 

### The first steps
This section is on the steps you need to take to begin medical care, such as finding a doctor and making sure they take your insurance, etc. 

### The primary care physician
PCPs are doctors that take care of the whole body. They are who you go to when you "go to the doctor." Many many specialists define themselves as PCPs, even when they really aren't. This is because insurance companies require a referral to go to a specialist, and that referral must be given by a PCP. 

PCPs are educated through university, four years of med school, and 3-7 years of internship and residency at a hospital. When they encounter a patient with a condition which requires an expert, they refer that patient to a specialist.

### The gastroenterologist
GIs go though all the training a PCP does, then 1-3 more years of specialized training. The field covers all aspects of digestion, and some GIs focus on CD while others are more wide-spectrum. 

You can have a GI as your PCP, or you could have two people filling these roles seperatley. If that is the case, make sure they work well together. 

### The colorectal surgeon
These folks have six years of surgical training after med school. There are also degrees of specialization in this field, with some surgeons more comfortable with certain operations that others. 

### The nutritionist or registered dietician
Diet is a heavily debated arena in CD. But everyone agrees that having a dietary plan is essential to getting the right nutrition. 

Nutritionists have no formal accreditation process to go through. On the other hand, RDs have to get a degree from a 4-year program certified by the ADA. Don't be fooled though, some RDs know nothing about Crohn's while some nutritionists are experts. 

### Dumping your doctor
Don't be an asshole if you think your doctor sucks. You don't want to burn any bridges if you don't have to. 

### Questions for the doctor
1. Why did you choose this field, and do you like it?
2. How much experience with CD do you have?
3. How many patients with CD do you have?
4. Are there any treatments or medications you avoid? Why?
5. What role do you think nutrition should play?
6. What is your preference for pain management?
7. How do you feel about alternative medicine?

## Learning: The intestinal complications of IBD
Many never experience these complications, but awareness of them is important. 

### Abscesses and fistulas
Abscesses are caused by a buildup of bacteria in a pocket in the mucosa. This bulge grows in size until it bumps into something. A burst abscess can cause deadly infection, and they cause fever under the best circumstances. 

After an abscess is drained through lancing or surgery, the space does not fill immediatley and can be re-infected. 

When an abscess reaches another organ or another section of the intestine and bursts, the tunnel can remain. This is a fistula. They aren't a problem when they're connecting two nearby loops of intestine, but they can be an issue if they aren't. 

### Toxic megacolon, fulminant colitis, and toxic colitis
These all describe a single condition, which is rare for those with CD. Toxic or fulmiant colitis becomes toxic megacolon when the muscular action of the colon is paralyzed, causing a severe build up in bacterial gas in the colon. This gas causes the colon to expand, risking rupture and deadly infection. 

### Perforation
With CD, the risk of this comes with an abscess. The only solution to a risk of perforation is resection to prevent the perforation, which could lead to deadly infection. 

### Strictures, obstructions, and adhesions
Inflammation causes a narrowing of the intestinal passage, particularly around the terminal ileum where the passage is already narrow near the ileocecal valve. A tightening of the passage results in a backlog of undigested material. 

In order to push food through the opening, the body resorts to intense peristalsis, resulting in intense pain and sometimes vomiting as food is forced through the gap muscularly. 

The solution to a partial obstruction is time. Eventually, the inflammation will die down and the situation will resolve itself. To help with the pain, narcotics are given and a diet of liquids is advised for a little bit. 

### Massive hemmorrhage
This is very rare. In CD, it happens most often when an errant ulcer or abscess drills into a blood vessel. The solution is blood transfusions to induce clotting, and most likely surgery to remove the affected area. 

# Day 6
## Living: When to call the doctor
### Notable symptoms
Intense abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood loss are great reasons to call the doctor. Also, a sudden fever with no flu conditions could be a sign of infection or severe inflammation. 

### Before calling the doctor
Be specific about symptoms. Describe blood loss in amounts. Have medication information handy. 

### Making the call
Even if you're on the way to the ER, it's a good idea to let your specialist know that you're going there. The doc can let the ER people know about your condition and it gives them time to plan a treatment option. 

## Learning: The ailments that accompany IBD
25% of those with CD will have an auxillary condition related to it. For many of these, the connection between them and CD is unknown. 

### The skin
Erythema nodosum is a pattern of reddish-purple bumps on the skin. They feel hot and hard, and can range in size from the size of a pencil eraser to a soda can. They are painful but not dangerous, and nothing can really be done about them. They often presage disease activity or happen during flares. 

Pyoderma gangrenosum is more dangerous. In this rare condition, the skin is degraded by puss-filled bumps, and sometimes needs to be replaced by skin grafts. 

Fistulas can appear between the intestines and the skin, as was mentioned in the section on fistulas. 

Skin tags and anal fissures are fairly common in CD. Skin tags appear post-hemmerhoid, and are relativeley harmless. Anal fissures can be treated with cream as they heal naturally. 

### The eyes
These conditions are generally more rare than skin conditions. Inflammation of the iris can cause a loss of vision. 

### The bones and joints
Peripheral arthirits is relatively common, affecting 20% of those with Crohn's. The pain and stiffness in the large joints caused by this condition usually clears up within a month or so. 

Ankylosing spondilitis is an inflammation of the spine, causing pain and stiffness. This can gradually cause the fusion of the spine and deformity. There is also a genetic component to who gets this condition. 

#### IBD and bone strength
CD can cause weakening of the bones earlier than healthy populations experience it. There are higher rates of [[osteoperosis]] and osteoporosis in CD populations (30-60%). 

This is because of steroid use that reduces calcium absorption, as well as generally bad absorption of nutrients.
