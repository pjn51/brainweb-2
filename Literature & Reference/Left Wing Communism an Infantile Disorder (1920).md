# Review
Lenin released this in 1920, coinciding with the second congress of the [[ComIntern]]. He was speaking directly to Marxists in western Europe, some of whom had failed to learn the lessons of [[Bolsheviks]]' success in [[Russia]]. 

This is a work of theory that those on the left today would do well to heed. It's probably the most relevant of Lenin's works for us modern leftists, since he's speaking directly to the communists working in parliamentary democracies in Western Europe. 

The main idea is that [[Marxists must be where the workers are]], and that we must work to explain the revolutionary way forward to the most advanced workers, acting as a transmission belt of revolutionary ideas.

## In what sense can we speak of the international significance of the Russian revolution?
Lenin starts off by saying that while some might have thought the socialist revolutions in the more developed capitalist countries might have been quite different from Russia's, there were in fact a lot of features of the Russian revolution that seem to generalize internationally.

Lenin admits that this is only true of "certain fundamental features," and says that once revolutionary movements take power in the advanced countries, Russia will be backwards in comparison once again, as it was in terms of capitalist development. 

Despite this, Lenin states that the Russian experience of revolution should be held up as an example of success, and that "the Russian model" reveals something very important about the future of all capitalist countries. He says that the advanced workers worldwide have often realized this, consciously, or subconsciously due to their revolutionary class instinct. He calls out the leaders of the [[Second International]] for failing to grasp this. 

Lenin points out, quite ironically, that [[Kautsky]] (himself one of those that Lenin calls a scoundrel of [[opportunism]] and social chauvinism) wrote in 1902 about the possibility of this very situation unfolding: with Russia acting as "a source of revolutionary energy" for Europe. 

"How well Karl Kautsky wrote eighteen years ago!" Lenin jokes. 

## An essential condition of the Bolsheviks’ success
Lenin points out that it is universally realized that the Bolsheviks couldn't have stayed in power "for two and a half months, let alone two and a half years" without iron Party discipline and the full support of the working class. This observation destroys the arguments of those who would paint the October Revolution as a coup. Without mass support, who would defend the 'coup?' Who would fight in the civil war against the forces of reaction? 

Lenin also points out that after the defeat of capitalists in a single country, the international [[bourgeoisie]] is a potent enemy who is dedicated to destroying the small pocket of proletarian power. He emphasizes that the international bourgeoisie draws power from their international connections, but also from the force of habit and small-scale production still present in the area newly controlled by the workers. This was certainly an issue in Russia, due to the huge peasant population. For us in the [[USA]], the risk of a conter-revolutionary [[petty bourgeoisie]] is greatly reduced. However, the force of habit left over by capitalist relations is still an issue as it was in Russia. Lenin understood these threats, and believed that they made the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] necessary. He said that there was no doubt that the "absolute centralisation and rigorous discipline of the proletariat" was an essential condition of success in preserving the revolution.

Embracing [[dialectics]] at every turn, Lenin asks what forces made it possible for the Bolsheviks to build such discipline. He turns to the history of Bolshevism to answer this question, saying that only by studying the whole history back to 1903 can we find these answers. 

The first questions Lenin tackles are the questions of how Party discipline is maintained, tested, and reinforced. Lenin explains that it's the [[class consciousness]] of the proletarian vanguard, secondly, by the ability of this vanguard to link up with the rest of the class *as well as the non-proletarian masses* and lead them. Thirdly, Lenin says that the correct leadership of the vanguard makes the establishment of a disciplined vanguard party possible. 

On this third point, Lenin says that when the vanguard's theory proves to be correct, and the vanguard makes correct decisions, the masses will see that the vanguard is correct from their own experience. This increases the trust the masses place in the vanguard. [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]]. 

Lenin says that the creation of these conditions takes a lot of work. This work can only be done, in his view, through correct revolutionary theory which is developed "in close connection with the practical activity of a truly mass and truly revolutionary movement." This brings up some questions for me. The Bolsheviks definitely did not develop their initial revolutionary theory as part of a huge movement, they numbered only a few thousand in their early years. Perhaps Lenin means that the theory is developed through observation of a mass movement. 

Lenin goes on to examine the reason for suitable conditions existing in Russia between 1917 and 1920, conditions that allowed the Bolsheviks to build and maintain iron discipline and centralization. He says that Bolshevism arose in 1903 on a firm foundation of genuine Marxism. The genuine-ness of this foundation was proved to Lenin by the failures of all the tendencies around them. 

Lenin says the reason this foundation developed was because of the difficult struggle to find a solution to the issues of Tsarism. Russian revolutionaries searched far and wide for a theory that could provide a way forward, Lenin says. Lenin outlines how the long process of searching, testing, and disappointment allowed the Russian movement to try out every idea under the sun, including European imports that were available because of the exile community that connected Russian revolutionaries with European ones. 

On the other hand, Lenin says that Bolshevism itself - after its conception - went through its own historical search for solutions. Lenin says that the rapid change of the movement from one form to another (legal to illegal and back, local circles to mass movement and back, etc) allowed the Bolsheviks to see for themselves the usefulness of tactics and ideas. This steeled them in personal experience of revolutionary activity and knowledge of how best to apply these tactics. 

## The principal stages in the history of Bolshevism
### The years of preparation for revolution (1903-1905)
Lenin outlines that everyone knew a storm was brewing. Because of this, he says all the factions in the movement from liberal-bourgeois, petty-bourgeois-democratic (hiding behind revolutionary imagery), and proletarian-revolutionary were preparing for battle. They were all arguing fiercely about tactics and goals. All the classes were forging the tools of battle through their programs and organizations. 

### The years of revolution (1905-1907)
Lenin outlines the process through which all the tactics of the previous period were tested in open battle. He emphasizes the importance of the spontaneous emergence of the Soviets, and the validation of the relationship between the proletariat (as leader) and the peasantry (as follower). He explains that the economic strikes developed into political ones, which developed into armed insurrection.

Lenin asserts that this "dress rehersal" for 1917 gave the workers a political education more concentrated than in any other period, and made the later revolution possible.

### The years of reaction (1907-1910)
Despite the efforts of the revolutionaries, Lenin admits that Tsarism won in the end. He points out that all the revolutionary groups were demoralized, split, and smashed. He connects this with a drift towards philisophical [[idealism]], which was an expression of their confusion (and confused the movement further). 

Lenin says that after 1905, the Tsarist regime made a more direct effort to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] and introduce [[capitalism]]. He says that this removed all wind from the ideas of somehow avoiding capitalist development in Russia. 

Lenin points out the 'silver lining' to this situation. The Bolsheviks were able to really see who their friends were, and learned how to retreat. He places special emphasis on the ability of a revolutionary party to retreat, saying that the Bolsheviks were the best at this, since they exposed and expelled the "revolutionary phrase-mongers" who refused to admit defeat and wanted to fight until the end, and refused to learn how to work within reactionary institutions like the parliament and trade [[unions]]. 

### The years of revival (1910-1914)
Lenin outlines how after the Lena events of 1912, the growth of the Bolsheviks sped up again. He explains how they threw off [[Mensheviks]], whose counter-revolutionary role was evident after 1905. 

He credits this success with the Bolsheviks' successful combination of legal work and illegal work, and especially their legal work within the reactionary Duma, which gained them esteem in the eyes of the workers who saw that the Bolsheviks were fighting for their cause everywhere they could.

### The first imperialist world war (1914-1917)
Lenin says that the reactionary parliament proved useful for the Bolsheviks. Their deputies, refusing to go along with the plans for war, were exiled to Siberia. Lenin says that this displayed the anti-war cred of the Bolsheviks to the workers. 

Lenin critiques the parties of the [[Second International]] for crumbling under the pressures of social chauvinism, and failing to adapt to being outlawed in their home countries. He emphasizes that one of the reasons the Bolsheviks were able to come to power was the clear distinction they made between themselves and these social chauvinists. 

This is another example of Lenin's use of [[dialectics]]. While the masses at first were sort of supportive of the war, this attitude changed rapidly as the war progressed. The position which was once popular became totally devastating to the parties that held it. By holding a principled stance even when it made them unpopular, the Bolsheviks were able to orient to future conditions.

### The second revolution in Russia (February to October 1917)
Lenin credits Tsarism's "senility and obsoleteness" for creating the destructive forces that culminated in its overthrow in February. As the leaders of the opposition and revolutionary parties began to set up a Provisional Government, Lenin points out that those who had been in parliament, even in a small minority, used that position as a springboard for setting up a new government. 

> [!note]
> I think that he mentions this as a word of warning to those who refuse to work within reactionary parliaments, saying that if the state were to fall, it is those minority leaders within parliament that would be in the best position to take power. 

Lenin critiques the Mensheviks and [[Socialist Revolutionaries]] for adopting all the methods and styles of the Second International, despite the discreditation that the latter had just gone through. He ties this with the behavior of more recent opportunists, such as the Fabians and the leaders of the Independent Labour Party of the [[UK]], saying that the Bolsheviks have already seen such behavior from the Mensheviks. 

Lenin outlines how the Mensheviks mishandled their majorities in the Soviets by failing to see the true potential of these institutions. This, in his view, led to the disintegration of their support. He ties this to the world situation, saying that the modern Mensheviks are disintegrating everywhere because of their failure to take power. 

Lenin explains that contrary to some European and [[USA|American]] leftists' views, the Bolsheviks actually began their struggle quite cautiously. He says that they first did *not* call for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. Instead, he says that they explained to the workers that the composition of the Soviets would have to be changed first. Lenin also points out that the Bolsheviks didn't declare a boycott of the bourgeois Constituent Assembly, instead pointing out that a "workers' and peasants' republic" would be better than any bourgeois-democratic republic. 

# The struggle against which enemies within the working-class movement helped Bolshevism develop, gain strength, and become steeled
Lenin begins by saying that the struggle against [[opportunism]] was vital to the Bolshevik movement. He says that opportunists were the principal enemies of the Bolsheviks, and continued to be the main enemy after the October revolution. 

The other enemy inside the working class movement, according to Lenin, was petty bourgeois revolutionism. To him, this had elements of [[Anarchism]]. He said that the [[petty bourgeoisie]] at this time was still a mass force capable of revolutionary action, but lacked the organization and discipline to carry out a real change of society. He says that the party most demonstrating this tendency were the [[Socialist Revolutionaries]].

Lenin explains that Anarchism wasn’t super pervasive because of the Bolsheviks, and because in the prior period it had developed and shown its uselessness to the full extent. 

During a crisis point, Lenin explains how Bolsheviks were compelled to reign in their left flank. During 1908, he says, some Bolsheviks wanted to abstain from participating in parliament whatsoever. According to Lenin, this was a very reactionary institution, but there was no prospect for a rising tide of revolution at that point (as there was in 1905 when the Bolsheviks boycotted the parliament). 

Lenin summarizes that the decision to compromise with the [[bourgeoisie]] is a delicate one. If defeat is certain, then compromise. 

# “Left-Wing” Communism in Germany. The Leaders, the Party, the Class, the Masses
Lenin explains how there was a split in the German communists. He elaborates how some said that the committee of the Communist Party was trying to ally with the Social Democrats and “recognizing in principle, all forms of struggle” including parliamentarianism. 

Lenin calls attention to the fact that this splinter group was focused on creating new radical trade unions. In order to get into these unions, Lenin says that the faction demands workers "recognize the supremacy of the Soviet system."

Lenin says that this opposition raised the question: party dictatorship or class dictatorship? To him, this question reveals how some party members were spoiled in some regard. He says they had always been able to legally and openly elect their representatives to the party, and were disturbed by the methods that were needed once the communist party was outlawed. He says they thought this meant that the party was becoming undemocratic, when really these were just unavoidable circumstances. 

Lenin also highlights how the opposition likes to distinguish between the masses and the leaders. He explains that a divergence between the political consciousness of the leadership and the masses only occurs when the consciousness of the masses is rapidly shifting, faster than the composition of the party’s leadership is shifting. Lenin says this is inevitable, and must be broken through by the more advanced members of the party moving from below. 

However, Lenin says the opposition generalizes this into an attack on “leaders” in general. In doing this, he says new leaders arise, saying “down with all leaders!” According to Lenin, they even claim that political parties are inherently bourgeois and unnecessary. 

In Lenin's view, this is a repudiation of the method that brought the Bolsheviks to power: the party principle, and party discipline. In his mind, setting down the party totally disarms the working class, leading to petty-bourgeois atomization and diffusion. Lenin reminds us that the party is the only instrument capable of the intense, concentrated, unified action needed for revolution. 

Lenin claims that in general, the opposition is ultra-left, wanting to jump from the twilight of capitalism all the way to the bright afternoon of the higher stage of [[communism]]. He says that this is simply impossible and that even after the expropriation of the capitalists and large landowners, there will still be a transitional phase while the petty bourgeoisie is slowly shrunken. At Lenin’s time, this class was powerful enough that this had to be a slow and careful process (however that is no longer really the case). Lenin says the presence of so many petty-bourgeois in the USSR made the [[proletariat]] susceptible to taking on a petty-bourgeois attitude of disunity and individualism at times. For him, this indicated that the centralization of the Party was important to maintain during this time. 

Lenin explains that during the dark days of illegal Party work, party discipline was even more important. At one point, Lenin reminds us that an agent provocateur got into the central committee of the Party. Lenin coninues, saying that the agent betrayed many, but was forced to also spread radicalizing information throughout Russia in order to keep the ruse going. By holding every member accountable, Lenin says the agent was forced to play at least a somewhat positive role. 

# Should Revolutionaries Work in Reactionary Trade Unions?
Lenin says that the german ‘lefts’ simply say "No" to this question. 

## The positions of the classes, the party, and the leaders as of 1920 in the USSR
The working class exercised their class dictatorship through the soviets. The working class was guided by the Communist Party, who numbered 600,000. Lenin was apprehensive of an excessive growth of the Party in order to avoid the entry of careerists. The only time the gates can be thrown open is when conditions are so dire that no logical charlatan or careerist would join the Party, fearing execution if the Party was to fall. 

The Party holds annual congresses with a basis of one delegate per 1,000 members. At these events, the Party elects a Central Committee of 19.  This CC manages and directs the work of the Party between congresses. The CC elects five CC members to the Organizing Bureau and the Political Bureau each. 

The unions in the USSR are separate from the Party, but are closely linked. This apparatus forms a flexible, broad tool of proletarian class rule. Through this tool, the Party is closely linked up with the class and the masses. Without close cooperation from the [[unions]] in economic and military affairs, the Party would have found it impossible to govern. 

There were also non-Party conferences and organizations of the peasants and workers growing throughout the country, and the Party supported the growth of these organs. 
Alongside the Party, the soviets have their own congresses, and constitute the most democratic institution the world has ever known. 

With this in mind, the question of the German ultralefts of either a dictatorship of the Party or of the class is absurd. There can be no class dictatorship without a vanguard to lead and educate them, but the vanguard cannot hope to hold power for a day without the enthusiastic support of the working class. 

The post-revolutionary period has to deal with the legacies of capitalism. One such legacy is the trade unions, which are at first divided into individual workplaces or occupations. Eventually, the movement will grow into industrial unions, and then eliminate the distinctions between different types of [[labor]] (manual vs intellectual, etc). This will be a prolonged process, and trying to rush it would be like trying to “teach higher mathematics to a child of four.”

> “We can (and must) begin to build socialism, not with abstract human material, or with human material specially prepared by us, but with the human material bequeathed to us by capitalism. True, that is no easy matter, but no other approach to this task is serious enough to warrant discussion.”

Dialectics alert! While the trade unions were a progressive force during capitalism and united the workers, under a proletarian state they began to reveal certain reactionary elements. They tend to be narrow-minded, focusing on only one craft or industry. They tend to be non-political, unable to see the broader picture. 

Under the new proletarian state, they were still useful as a method of teaching the workers how to exercise their new class dictatorship, and a building block of the future organization of society under the higher stage of communism. 

The Mensheviks found much support in the trade unions, where they found allies in the labor aristocracy. This labor aristocracy developed much more in Western Europe than in Russia, so this was more important as a lesson for other revolutionaries. 

The ultraleft mistake of abandoning the trade unions because of reactionary leadership fails to remember that Communists wage a battle against such leadership for the support of the workers. Withdrawing from trade unions and trying to create their own is “...tantamount to the greatest service Communists could render the bourgeoisie.” [[Marxists must be where the workers are]].

> [!question]
> This is exactly what the [[stalinism|Stalinists]] did! They did this in Germany with the [[KPD]], didn't they?

**If you really want to win the masses, you have to work wherever the masses are found. If this means working inside reactionary organizations, so be it. **

The ultralefts wanted to make recognition of the supremacy of the Soviet system the condition for entry into their new workers union. This would have been a bad idea in the USSR, much less in Germany. The mission of the Communists is to convince and pull along the backward strata of the working class, not artificially separate themselves from it with academic slogans. 

Even in the Tsar’s Russia, when the Black Hundreds organized workers’ assemblies and societies for the purpose of trapping revolutionaries, the Bolsheviks sent agents in to make contact with the workers, at risk of serious consequences. 

# Should We Participate in Bourgeois Parliaments?
While the parliamentary form of organization is outdated and obsolete in a historical developmental sense, it has not been overcome yet. 

Ultralefts tend to say that parliamentarianism is obsolete, and that there are millions of workers who still support the system. How can both of these things be true? Electoralism would only be obsolete and outmoded if the working class believed it to be. If the working class had moved past electoralism, then it would certainly be useless. But that isn't the case. 

Ultralefts confuse their own organizations for the class itself. They say that since their members view electoralism as a dead end, then they should move beyond it. They forget that the communists’ role is at the vanguard of the working class. This means that where the working class is, the communists must also be, in order to move the most advanced workers one step further. In this way, [[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]]. 

Revolutionaries must work wherever the masses are to be found, making clear to the uneducated masses the error of their investment in bourgeois electoralism, but not ignoring and writing off the struggle of the workers altogether. 

Participation in bourgeois electoralism by a revolutionary party helps to demonstrate how badly these institutions work, how they prop up class society and capitalism.

The ultralefts say that during periods of revolution, where the masses themselves have created their own bodies of power like soviets, then revolutionaries should abstain from all bourgeois electoral activity. This is false! During such a period, having a revolutionary faction within the bourgeois system would help to hasten its demise, as long as the party was truly revolutionary. 

In 1905, the Bolsheviks boycotted parliament. This successfully prevented a reactionary parliament from even convening, during a period where mass work outside electoralism was speeding up. 

The ultralefts say that the leaders cannot be trusted to engage in electoralism and remain revolutionary. However, watching the behavior of leaders within parliament is a good way to test their resolve and commitment to revolution. 

# No Compromises?
Ultralefts say that a communist can make no compromises with the oppressors. This is childish. Every worker who has engaged in struggle knows that there are justified and unjustified compromises. A strike that has run out of funding, and whose strikers are exhausted, knows that returning to work with only some demands being met is common sense. The workers also know what it’s like to have treacherous leadership create the “material need” for compromise out of thin air. 

It is the role of a revolutionary party to amass all the experience and knowledge of the best of the working class in order to figure out when to compromise and when to hold strong. To simplify this process to a slogan of “no compromise!” is childish. 

In the global class war against the bourgeoisie, it is absurd to say that the leadership of the proletariat must decide on a course of action at the onset of conflict, and never change course or backtrack or compromise, or exploit divisions within its enemies. 

In the first period after the proletarian revolution, the working class will still be weaker than the local bourgeoisie, because of the international connections and resources of the global ruling class. Therefore, the vanguard must carefully exploit all divisions between factions of the national bourgeoisie in order to weaken them. 

The history of the Bolsheviks is full of rational alliances and compromises. The Bolsheviks allied for a time with the bourgeoisie against the Tsar, with the peasants against the bourgeoisie, and with the Mensheviks. However, the Bolsheviks never stopped ruthlessly critiquing their allies for their flaws. 

For instance, in order to win over the peasants, the Bolsheviks deeply compromised by accepting the entirety of the SR agrarian program of land redistribution. This was very antithetical to the Bolshevik and Marxist perspective of the development of the agricultural sector, but the urban working class deeply needed the support of the peasants in that moment. 

In revolutionary build-ups, there is often a sudden swing from right to left in the outlook of the workers. In order for the communists to really benefit from this, they need to have a foothold in the electoral arena. In Russia, this was the case and the Bolsheviks went from 13% to 51% in three months. However, the German communists refused to participate in parliament, and all the leftward momentum of the workers translated to gains for a center-left petty bourgeois party. 

# “Left-Wing” Communism in Great Britain
During this time, there were negotiations between a number of left wing groups to unite and form a Communist Party. However, there is disagreement on participation in parliament. 

The revolutionary spirit and fervor of those who want to prevent what they see as a betrayal of the revolution by entry into a bourgeois parliament is admirable, but incorrect at the time of writing. The left wing wants to do away with the bourgeois class of politicians, who they correctly identify are a scourge. However, they mistakenly believe that they don't have to put forward their own proletarian politicians. 

They also say that the Soviets will be the instrument of liberation, and they are correct. However, they fail to think of politics as a science, where the context and external conditions matter. Parliamentarianism will disintegrate, true, but this process can be accelerated from within by pro-soviet politicians. These politicians must be held in line by a strong proletarian organization. 

Even though these politicians who claim to represent the working class are no doubt treacherous, and will betray the revolution given the chance, revolutionaries should still give them some amount of support. Many workers still follow the lead of these losers, and it was critical for the workers in Russia to see first-hand how little these people can actually improve the situation once in power. 

This means that revolutionaries and communists must participate in parliament, in order to bring this state of affairs about so that it can be seen as fraudulent. This will cause a shift in the minds of the workers who will view parliament as less legitimate. 

Without the workers ever seeing for themselves that the reformists are totally useless, they will never come to the side of revolution, and the communists will remain “mere windbags” in the minds of the workers. 

Lenin said that the British left should unite into a Communist Party, and enter a conditional alliance with the reformists in parliament, under the conditions that they share parliamentary seats in accordance with votes received in a special ballot of workers, and that the left retain total freedom of propaganda and political activity outside the alliance against the right wing.

By helping to hasten a Labor government, and by spreading their propaganda among the workers more effectively, the Communists would be the ones really gaining from this arrangement. Individual seats in parliament are of no matter to the Communists, as they are to the Liberals. We focus on agitating and rousing the working class. 

In fact, if the reformists refuse these terms, the Communists benefit even more. This shows the false promises of the reformists, and their ultimate siding with class society. If this were to happen, the Communists should only run candidates in safe districts, and urge their supporters to vote for the Labour candidate against the Liberals. 

> “...with my vote, I want to support the reformists in the same way as the rope supports a hanged man- that the impending establishment of a government of the [reformists] will prove that I am right, will bring the masses over to my side, and will hasten the political death of the reformists, just as was the case with their kindred spirits in Russia and Germany.” 

The question of whether or not to affiliate with the Labor party was too complex for Lenin to get into here, but he said that in this matter as with all others, flexibility of tactics was required. 

# Several Conclusions
The 1905 revolution in Russia revealed the power of the economic and political strike, and the power of the proletariat in general, far out of proportion with its percentage of the population at the time. The political strike developed into an armed uprising, and the spontaneous formation of the Soviets. 

It is essential for the world Communist movement to take into account the universal struggle against, one one hand, [[reformism]] and opportunism, and on the other hand ultra-leftism. But also, the struggle will develop in a unique way in each country, and we cannot mechanically apply a set of tactics or strategy. 

Instead of being dogmatic about all issues, communists should be united in the central goal of defeating the bourgeoisie, and ushering in the dictatorship of the proletariat on a global scale. 

The first step is to win the vanguard of the working class to communism. However, this vanguard is incapable of carrying a whole revolution. It needs the broader working class. In order to get the broader class on board, the working class needs to have its own political experience. Propaganda won't be enough. The workers have to see for themselves. The masses both in Russia and Germany had to see for themselves that the spineless reformists would be no help, and that the only alternative to a dictatorship of the proletariat was a dictatorship of the reactionaries (Kornilov, etc). 

While the task of consolidating a vanguard still remains, propaganda work is the most important. After the vanguard is strong, and the time comes for the masses to come into play, merely repeating the theoretical ideas of “pure communism” won't suffice. Agitation of the workers is necessary. One must not count in the hundreds and thousands, one must count in the millions and the tens of millions. 

We will know that the final battle is at hand when three conditions are met. When these conditions are true, the situation is ripe for revolution.

1. When all the class forces hostile to us are at each other's throats and have weakened themselves fighting impossible battles
2. When the unstable intermediate elements like the petty bourgeois have been exposed as frauds in the eyes of the people through their failure to resolve the crisis
3. When a mass sentiment among the workers favors revolutionary action.

Inexperienced revolutionaries often say that legal methods of struggle must be opportunist because they are so often used to deceive and defeat the workers, and that illegal methods are illegal precisely because they are revolutionary. This is false. 

Communists should use every weapon in the political battle against reformism and ultra-leftism. 

It’s nearly impossible to predict when an uprising will occur in a developed capitalist country, as the direct cause will be one of a thousand offenses (see: George Floyd) that the bourgeoisie and its agents carry out each day. 

The bourgeoisie deserved Lenin’s thanks for publicly talking about the dangers of Bolshevism all through the world. By doing this, they made sure every worker in the developed world was discussing the ideas of Marxism and the Bolsheviks. The best thing for them to do would be to ignore the victories of Bolshevism. The only place the bourgeoisie can win is in the suppression of terror and revolutionary violence. By suppressing revolution, the bourgeoisie is acting as every doomed class has done, and this method can't save them in the long run. 

The only thing that the communist movement needs is to remember to maintain flexibility in tactics. This is the aspect lacking in the developed parts of Europe and the United States. It’s important that leftists don't become fixated on one mode of growth of the working class organizations and of the vanguard. 
Every channel of growth is merely a temporary opportunity, which can close at the changing of external conditions. 

Marxists should be sure to be totally flexible in which ways they are organizing, and which methods they are adopting. 

Both right doctrinairism and left doctrinairism are errors that should be avoided, and corrected if they are discovered. Right doctrinairism holds onto the old forms, ignoring the new content that surges through them. Left doctrinairism swears off the old forms, ignoring the fact that revolutionary content can surge through any form given enough pressure. It is the duty of communists to master working within all forms, in order to be able to supplement one form with another, or switch forms rapidly when the situation calls for it.
