Woods says that, for Marxists, the revolution in [[China]] was second only to the October Revolution in [[Russia]] in terms of historical importance. He says that the first Chinese Revolution in 1925-27 was a genuine proletarian revolution, but that the mis-leadership by [[Stalin]], [[Bukharin]], and [[Mao]] aborted it. 

Woods points to the dissolution of the [[CPC]] into the [[Kuomintang]] caused the masacre of the Communists at the hands of the KMT in Shanghai. Woods attributes this smashing of the proletarian vangaurd as the cause for the radically different class character that the Chinese Revolution took as opposed to the Russian Revolution of 1917. 

## Rottenness of Bourgeoisie
Woods points out that the Revolution of 1949 succeeded only because of the total dead-end that landlordism and [[capitalism]] found itself in in China. He says that Chiang Kai-shek, who led the KMT to power over the corpses of the workers of Shanghai, had 20 years to provide bourgeois solutions, but failed. 

Drawing upon the theories developed by [[Trotsky]], Woods says that the national [[bourgeoisie]] of China was so bound to the international capitalist class through the proceesses of [[imperialism]] that they were a totally reactionary force. He says that the bourgeoisie was unwilling to solve the agrarian problem and unable to even fully introduce capitalism to China. 

Woods highlights how the rottenness of the bourgeoisie was displayed during [[WW2]]. He says the KMT and CCP supposedly engaged in a "united front" against [[Japan]], but that the CCP did most of the fighting while the KMT manuvered to keep the CCP in check. 

Woods calls attention to the effect that the swift defeat of the Japanese in Manchuria at the hands of the Red Army had on the course of the war. He says that the power of the Red Army also affected the decisions made by the [[USA]], including the decision to drop nuclear weapons on Japan to ensure they would surrender before the Red Army had a chance to invade. 

Displaying the class unity of the bourgeoisie, Woods notes that the surrendering Japanese troops were told only to surrener to the KMT, and to continue fighting the Communists in order to prevent the Japanese resources falling into the Peoples' Liberation Army's (PLA) control. 

Even more explicitly, Woods points us to Truman's memoirs, where he writes...

> It was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send Marines to guard the seaports.

## [[Stalin]] and the Chinese Revolution
Woods said that Stalin carefully played the PLA and the KMT off against one another, ensuring that the CCP was unable to secure an outright victory. He says that in Soviet-occupied Manchuria, the USSR allowed the KMT to occupy key positions in the cities while the PLA occupied the countryside. 

Woods says that this was because Stalin didn't have faith in the ability of the CCP to take power. He claims Stalin was more interested in maintaining good relations with the KMT. This would explain Stalin's conservative use of the new Manchurian territory, shipping back everything he could back to the USSR, including whole factories. Woods attributes this to Stalin's nationalistic outlook, and his lack of enthusiasm for a dynamic revolutionary movement not under his control. 

Woods sees the origination of the Sino-Soviet split here. Not in an ideological difference, but in a conflict of interest between two rival bureaucracies. Woods contrasts what he calls a "narrow nationalism" with the proletarian internationalism of [[Lenin]] and Trotsky. 

Woods asks, if Stalin and Mao both stood on the program of Leninism, why they did not propose the creation of a united federation of the Soviet Union and China. He says that they never floated this because their interests were based not on Leninism, but on cynical national interests. 

## USA Helps Chiang Kai-shek
Woods says that the [[USA|American]] public was weary from fighting and would not support a new war to subjugate China, which the ruling class no doubt wanted. He says that this explains the methods used to combat the CCP, which consisted of manuver and intrigue. 

Woods provides an overview of the various methods that the US gave aid to the KMT, including arms, [[currency|money]], and training. In return, the KMT allowed American companies special privledges in areas under its control. 

## Agrarian Revolution
Woods provides a sketch of the massive civil war opened in 1946 by the KMT. He tells us how the KMT made large advances, taking over a lot of the territory controlled by the PLA, including their capital Yenan. He says that Mao's decision to withdraw from the cities into the countryside was a great move. The strength of the PLA lay not in their material forces, but their forces of propaganda. By offering the [[peasantry]] land, Woods says that Mao was able to rally them to support the PLA and CCP. 

Woods says that this necessity laid the foundation for Mao's theories about the countryside "surrounding the cities." 

Woods explains how in every village the PLA occupied, they distributed land to the peasants but left some unoccupied plots. He say the reason for this was that when the PLA captured soldiers from the KMT, they would give them political education and then send them to their home villages, where they would propagandize for the PLA. 

Woods says that this tactic of relying on the peasantry proved to be highly effective, providing the PLA with a steady supply of recriuts, as well as logistical support. 

## The Final Offensive
Woods explains how Chiang Kai-shek was a brutal dictator, but pretended to offer democratic reforms to silence his critics abroad. He proposed a National Assembly (which would exclude the Communists of course). Woods says that Mao denounced these reforms as fraudulent. 

By basing themselves in the peasantry, Woods says that the PLA was able to maintain a fighting force more effective than that of the KMT, whose civilian support was nonexistant. Just as in revolution, it seems that basing ones forces on a definite class is essential for victory in war. 

## The Fall of Beiping
Woods says that it was clear the Mao was about to defeat the KMT, but that some 'so-called Trotskyists' persisted in denying this, including [[James Cannon]]. Apparently Cannon thought that Mao would surrender to Chiang Kai-shek. To me this seems quite funny. 

Woods outlines the creation of Taiwan as a refuge for Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies. He say that before they evacuated Beiping, they stripped the treasury of about $300 million to line their pockets. 

## The Red Army and the Workers
Woods notes that before the war, Trotsky pointed out that the decisive question was what would happen when Mao's forces entered the cities. Trotsky said that a genuine [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]] would base itself on these workers, encourgaing their organization and their taking of power. 

Woods claims that a totally different approach was taken by Mao. He says that the 1949 Revolution displayed a tendency towards [[Bonapartism]] from the start. He points to the fact that the CCP formed a coalition government with the various factions from the fractured KMT government and repressed the independent actions taken by the workers. 

Woods points to the program of the PLA as they entered the cities. This program promised the protection of all bourgeois property and class relations, focusing on the maintainance of order as they took over the functions of the state. 

## The Shadow of the Bourgeoisie
Woods says that Mao's idea of forming a coalition with the bourgeoisie for a continuation of capitalism was foiled by the fact that the national bourgeoise and large landowners had mostly fled to Taiwan. 

Woods notes that the People's Republic of China was supposedly a multi-party coalition, but that the CCP constituted the vast majority of all governmental positions. He says that seeking to ally with the bourgeoisie, Mao had entered into an alliance with its shadow. 

## The New State
Woods describes Mao's state as Bonapartist. This means that Mao was balancing between the classes, not relying firmly on one class or another. It was through this state, Woods says, that the expropriation of the capitalists and landlords was carried out. 

Woods emphasizes that the establishment of a planned economy was a giant step forward for China, but underscores that this was not a proletarian revolution like Lenin led. He says that because of the passive role played by the working class througout this whole process, the movement towards a bureaucratic regime was predictable. 

Woods gives a sketch of how the CCP used the peasantry as a battering ram to obliterate its enemies in the capitalist and landlords, but failed to substitute workers' democracy for the previous system. He counterposes this to the October Revolution, in which the peasantry played a secondary role and was led by the urban proletariat. 

Woods reminds us that the Bolsheviks, including Lenin, went as far as to say the peasantry could never play a revolutionary role, and that socialist revolution was impossible in Russia due to the peasant class composition. He goes further to say that this is actually another confirmation of Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]], that the masses can actually move beyond capitalism before the classical bourgeois revolution has really occured. 

Woods points out that at the time, only [[Ted Grant]] predicted the creation of a proletarian Bonapartist regime in China, and even predicted the coming rift between China and the USSR. 

## A Giant Step Forward
Woods reminds us of some socialist basics. The nationalization of the [[means of production]] is only a precondition for socialism, and does not constitue socialism itself. He says that the movement towards socialism requires the active participation of the workers, and is incompatible with the rule of a priviledged elite, like the CCP was and still is. 

Woods blames the corruption and deformations found in the global workers' movement on the lateness of revolution in the advanced countries. However, he strongly defends the gains made by the Chinese revolution. He contrasts the current state of China and India, explaining that the principal difference is the existance of a planned economy in China. 

However, Woods says, the leading layers in Chinese society have taken the road back to capitalism. This was made possible because the bureaucratic layer raised itself above society and is now able to act against the workers and peasants. 

Woods proclaims that in the future, the workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals can reclaim their mantle. If they rediscover the revolutionary legacy of their country, the sleeping giant of the Chinese people can shake the world.
