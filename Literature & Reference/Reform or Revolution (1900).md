Luxemburg attacks [[Bernstein]] for attempting to remove the class perspective from his analysis. She argues that by doing this, he ignores the fact that [[Every class has interests]] and instead attempts to rise above these distinctions. Echoing the idea that [[Neutrality is impossible]], she says that the only thing he accomplishes is sinking to the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] outlook, since [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]] (RPM, p370).

Rosa goes on to describe the [[dialectics|dialectic]] as "the sword that has helped the proletariat pierce the darkness of its future" (p370). This is an excellent turn of phrase: [[The dialectic is a weapon]].
