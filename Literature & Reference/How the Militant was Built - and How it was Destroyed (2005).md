> This article was published by [[Rob Sewell]] in 2005. It discusses the [[trotskyism|Trotskyist]] persepective on the rise and fall of [[Militant]], from which the [[IMT]] is descended. 

## The Height of the Militant
Sewell begins by explaining how the Militant was very well known by the late 80s. He says that they controlled the [[Labour Party (UK)]] youth wing, had a growing influence in the trade [[unions]] and the party itself, and had control of the Liverpool city council - built on more than 8,000 supporters and 200 full timers (PDF, p.1). 

He explains that these victories triggered repression from the ruling class, and the biggest witch-hunt against Marxists since the 20s. He argues that the architects of [[capital]] were unable to ignore the threat posed by a radical Labour party in the way that they ignore fringe leftist groups. However, he says, the Militant was led astray by a section of its leadership in an ultra-left direction (Ibid, p.1). 

## Modest Beginnings
The first organization of what would become Militant, Sewell outlines, was a monthly newspaper founded by [[Ted Grant]] and a few others, with the main task being a defense of the authentic theory and methods of [[Trotskyism]] against [[opportunism]] and [[ultraleftism]] during the lull in revolutionary activity (Ibid, p.2). 

A different group, Sewell says, called The Socialist Labor League, had attempted to take over the youth organization of the Labour Party in 1960, engaging in a premature confrontation that led to their expulsion (Ibid, p.2). 

## Militant Launched
The author describes how it was at this low point that Grant and others decided to launch a new paper aimed at the Labour youth, called _Militant_ . It was at this time, Sewell explains, that Taaffe was brought aboard. He argues that Taaffe wasn’t as politically sharp as Grant, but he was very helpful in building the organization. (Ibid, p.2-3).

Sewell tells us that Grant emphasized the role of political education and [[cadre]] building, but also made sure the Militant would be oriented towards the mass organizations of the working class - the Labour Party and the [[unions]] (Ibid, p.3). 

## Ultra-lefts and Labour
During this time, the author says, the Labour government was carrying out right-wing policies that led to wide discontent. He explains that many sects split off from the Labour Party, but Militant stayed with the perspective that even though Labour was held by capitalist forces, it was still the authentic [[workers' party]] in the [[UK]] and should be fought for (Ibid, p.4). 

The viewpoint of Militant, according to Sewell, was that instead of ordering the working class to abandon Labour and form a new mass organization, it was the role of a revolutionary party to prepare for future events, and to patiently explain the ideas of Marxism to the workers, while consolidating those who were ready to draw revolutionary conclusions (Ibid, p.4). 

## The Sussex Group
The article outlines how Brighton was a key area for Militant, because of the work of [[Alan Woods]]. He joined the tendency, Sewell tells us, in 1960 and was a key member up until ‘76, when he went to [[Spain]] to build there underground (Ibid, p.5). 

## Foresight and Astonishment
Sewell argues the ultra-lefts who had left the Labour party had no theoretical base, and were left astonished by the shift in the Labour party, which Militant knew would happen eventually (Ibid, p.5). 

As it were, he says, things were bad in the Labour party. In his view, Militant was only active in the youth organizations, and that side had its wings clipped - National Committee members were to be appointed by the central organization, and contact between youth branches was not allowed. He says that talk was limited strictly to “youth matters,” but nevertheless, Militant had won a majority in the leadership of the youth wing (the LPYS) (Ibid, p.5). 

Sewell explains that even at this time, Militant only had 217 supporters in the UK. Soon after the start of an expanded printing operation, he remarks that their supporters grew to 354 (Ibid, p.6). 

## Transformation of the Unions
As the working class began to wake up, Sewell explains, the unions shifted to the left, coming into conflict with the government, and were even threatening a 24-hr general strike in ‘72. He describes how this growing industrial militancy began to feed into the Labour party, moving it to the left at all levels. In ‘73, he says, the Labour leadership came out in support of nationalizing the top 25 monopolies in the UK (Ibid, p.6-7). It's depressing how radical this is from our American perspective! 

As the Labour party moved left, he says, Militant began to gain some flesh on their cadere bones, with LPYS meetings and Militant fringe meetings growing in attendance (Ibid, p.7).  

During this time, he remarks, the UK sent troops into Northern Ireland, with the Militant being a lone voice against the action (Ibid, p.7). 

## Counter-reforms
At this point, the Tory govt collapsed, and was replaced by a Labour govt led by Wilson. Due to global economics, they began a course of austerity, which caused more strikes. This demoralized the Labour leadership, who handed the PM to Callaghan. This govt crumbled too, as many workers began to unionize for the first time. 

This crisis allowed the Tendency to connect to workers as never before. By 1976, there were 1000 members, and the paper grew along with the new members. This was the time Militant began to attract ruling class attention and alarm. 

By ‘79, there were 1500 members. 

## Ruling Class Alarmed
After the rise of Thatcher, Militant’s support broke 2,500. The ruling class attempted to split Labour by forming the Social Democratic Party with a section of the right wing of Labour. This backfired, removing all the brakes on the leftward shift of Labour. 

The capitalist class knew that Militant played a key role in stiffening Labour against [[reformism]], and took aim at the growing organization. MI5 placed secret agents within Militant, and the press spread disinformation. 

During a swing to the right on the NEC, an ‘investigation’ into Militant was started.

## The fight against the witch-hunt
There were always Marxists in Labour. The attempt to root them out was really an assault on internal democracy. Their claim that the Marxists were organized outside of Labour was a smokescreen. The right wing of Labour has always been organized like this. 

Militant organized “anti witch-hunt” meetings that were well attended. Their support rocketed to 3,500. Labor expelled those on the Militant Editorial Board, thinking that without the head, the body would die. This was not the case. If Labour wanted to purge Militant, it would have to do so up and down the UK, causing large damage to itself. This is exactly what happened. 

Even as the purges wreaked havoc on Labour, Militant sent two MPs to Parliament for the first time. 

## Liverpool City Council
Militant elected multiple people to the Liverpool city council, to the dismay of the right wing of Labor. This success was the result of decades of organizing in the area. 

With a majority on the council, Militant faced a choice: give in to the Liberal-Tory austerity budget, or fight. They chose to fight. They set a deficit budget, and demanded that the Tories make up the difference. They supported this with a wide ranging movement of the working class, involving marches, rallies, and strikes. Labour was rewarded when their majority shot up in the next election. 

This was the final straw for Labour reactionaries. The Liverpool branch of the Labour party was suspended outright, and purges of all Militant members began. Through this, Militant was not dismayed. They were winning broad support from the rank-and-file, and organized a 5,000 person rally to celebrate the 27th anniversary of Militant. 

## Successes in the unions and the youth
Militant sent organizers to help with the national miners strike, where they gained over 500 new members. Militant was even making plans to go underground if their national headquarters were raided by the secret police. 

Due to the influence of Militant in the LPYS, Labour rightists sought to shut down the org. It was a throwback to the previous curtailing of rights in the youth wing of the party. 

At this time, press coverage of Militant was at a saturation point, and membership went past 8,000. 

## The Poll Tax
The Thatcher govt promised to introduce a hated poll tax. Militant organized a campaign of non-payment. Within one year, one million Scots were refusing to pay. 

The Labour leadership refused to support breaking the law, creating a power vacuum around such a universally-hated tax.

On the day of the introduction of the tax, Militant organized a 250,000 strong demonstration in London. 

The tax was eventually withdrawn, and Thatcher was forced to resign.

## Internal Problems
The mass work around the Poll Tax had its drawbacks. The huge amount of work fell on a few shoulders and the organization was becoming unbalanced. The tendency lost touch with other aspects of the work, dizzy with success because of all the victories of the Poll Tax campaign. 

Political education stalled just as many new members were arriving, and there wasn’t a sense of proportion about what the tax campaign could really accomplish. 

Many older comrades started to burn out, and were replaced by inexperienced, uneducated ones. 

The text says that full timers were substituting themselves for the rank-and-file, who were substituting themselves for the class. What does this mean?

The group around Taaffe was losing all sense of proportion. They thought the British Revolution was in the works, and lost sight of reality. Taaffe sought to out-maneuver Ted Grant, who opposed this turn towards short-term gains, and emphasized the need for political education. 

Taaffe moved to remove [[Alan Woods]] from the Militant’s theoretical journal, claiming that Woods was too busy. 

## The Scottish Turn
An explosion of tension occured in the leadership. Woods and Grant accused Taaffe of forming a clique by promoting his yes-men. As soon as this happened, it became apparent that the Taaffe clique had been preparing for this situation. They brought the weight of the whole apparatus against Woods and Grant. They forced all members to sign a kind of loyalty oath and instituted all kinds of petty measures aimed on isolating those in opposition to them.

## The Walton adventure
When a seat opened up in the government, a Militant supporter put her name forward but was blocked by the Labour center. Taaffeites wanted to run their own candidate here as a shortcut around Labour. Grant aptly described this as a shortcut off a cliff. 

Taaffe told Militant MPs to disavow support for the Labour candidate, effectively putting them on the chopping block for expulsion. All this effort didn't help the Militant candidate, who came third by a long stretch behind the Labour candidate. 

After this utter failure, the Taaffeites refused to admit they were wrong. They wanted to repeat this “success” all over the country! Their overriding concern was the prestige of the leadership. By refusing to admit this single mistake, they threw away 40 years of work. 

Sensing weakness, the right of Labour intensified the crackdown. Since Militant members were ordered to campaign for the Militant candidate against Labour, they were all able to be thrown out. In one stroke, 147 Militant members were purged. 

For speaking up against these mistakes, Alan, Ted, and many others were expelled from Militant. 

## The heritage we reject...
After the final success of the Taaffe group, their approach was thoroughly tried out. They quickly nosedived from 8,000 members to a few hundred after splitting with Labour. The whole organization was beset by split after split as Taaffe excommunicated anyone who dared to disagree with him. They jettisoned every authentic Marxist idea, and even the name Militant itself, which was idiotic from a marketing perspective. 

## And the heritage we defend
The Militant grew because it stuck with the Labour party when all other groups split. It stayed oriented towards the mass organizations of the working class. 

Those who say the Militant was destroyed by a change in objective conditions are incorrect. As Ted Grant said, good leadership is more important during periods of retreat than when you are advancing. Good leadership can retreat orderly, while maintaining the gains one has made. Bad leadership turns a retreat into a total disaster, as Taaffe did.
