Woods says that May 1968 was the greatest revolutionary general strike in history, and that it took the entire left off guard because they had written off the European working class as reactionary. He explains that it took place during a gigantic upswing in [[capitalism]]. 

# Foresight and astonishment
Woods quotes *The Economist* discussing the fact that the economy of [[France]] was doing so well in 1968 because of the weakness of the [[unions]] there. He says that that same year, a social uprising shocked the world [[bourgeoisie]].

Woods lambasts the proponents of [[Stalinism]], [[reformism]], and the academic Marxists, who he says outright denied the possibility of such an event occuring.

# The background
Woods explains that after the Paris Commune, the French bourgeoisie was terrified of the workers, and embarked on a course of [[imperialism]] in order to export the class struggle far away. However, Woods explains that the forces of capitalist development had strengthened the working class in France despite this, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 

Woods claims that due to the overwhelming power of the French working class, a peaceful transformation of society was possible if only the [[PCF]] had acted as true Marxists. Woods argues that it was only the betrayal of the Stalinist leaders that prevented a socialist revolution.

# Role of the students
Woods says that the students are always a sensitve barometer of the tensions building up in society. He outlines how the student protests that preceded the May events acted like the lightning that precedes a storm. 

Explaining the effects of the wave of student protests, Woods elaborates that the administration of Sorbonne University decided to close campus, and attempted to use the police to clear the courtyard. He says that this led to nearly 600 arrests, and a massive intensification of the protests. 

Woods outlines how every clash between the police and students led to a further development of the anger of the students, who created barricades and threw cobblestones at the police. Woods explains that the struggle soon spread to the workers near the universities, who were indiscrimitately beaten by police and soon began to fight back with objects thrown from windows onto the police. He says that hundreds of police officers were hospitalized. 

During the first week of violence, Woods explains that the PCF had belittled the students and the union leaders had ignored them. Howerver, Woods outlines the process of pressure from below that forced these leaders to take action, which came in the form of a general strike across France.

# General strike
Woods emphasizes that while the clashes had been limited to the students up until this point, there was a lot of turmoil below the surface of French society. He says that the general strike of May 13 marked a turning point in the whole of society.

 Woods claims that the leaders of the unions didn't want the strike to last or become more militant, seeing the general strike as a way to let off steam. However, Woods says the strike aquired a life of its own once it was called. He explains that while there were only 3.5 million organized workers, the strike encompassed more than 10 million workers across France. 
 
 Woods describes the unstoppable takeover of French society by the workers, saying that one after another each critical industry was occupied under workers control. First, he says, the workers seized the Renault factory, then public transport, then the railway, the coal mines, the gas and electricity grid, and practically all the critical levers of the country's economy. 
 
 Woods explains that this had immense consequences for the rest of society, even the industries not on strike. He says that all stores had stickers in their windows stating that they had permission from the strike committee to operate, and all prices were set by the strike committee in coordination with the associations of the [[peasantry]].
 
 Describing the [[petty bourgeoisie]], Woods says that many of its layers were also caught up in the revolution. He says that architects occupied their associations, Catholic priests occupied churches (demanding a debate instead of mass), and scientists occupied their laboratories and refused to research.
 
 # Power in the streets
 Meanwhile, Woods describes the situation in the streets of Paris. He says that thousands braved tear gas and the batons of the police each night, and that demonstrators attempted to torch the Stock Exchange. 
 
 Describing the situation of the media, Woods says that workers had seized the offices of newspapers, the telephone system, and all the tools that the state uses for dissemination of bourgeois propaganda. Instead, he says, these tools were in the hands of the workers who published the declarations of the strike committee and forced bourgeois publications to censor their editorials.
 
 Woods explains that the attempts by the state to calm the masses were hilariously ineffective. He says President De Gaulle announced a national referendum, but was unable to even get ballots printed due to a strike of the printing workers and the refusal of the workers in Belgium to scab.
 
  Woods says that the forces of reaction now sprung into action, forming Committees for the Defense of the Republic in an attempt to turn the middle classes against the revolution.
  
  # The myth of the "strong state"
  Woods explains that the situation caught the ruling class totally off guard. In haste, Woods says that they evacuated the presidential palace in fear that the crowd would break in.
  
  Woods calls attention to the words of President De Gaulle, who said "Don't worry, the Communists will keep them in order." By this, Woods says that the French state was relying on the Stalinist and [[reformism|reformist]] labor leaders to divert the energy of the masses. 
  
  Woods outlines how at the last moment, the labor leaders threw a lifeline to the French state and capitalism. He says that while the French state was totally paralyzed, and the workers controlled the country, the labor leaders announced they were willing to "negotiate!" 
  
  Seizing on this opportunity, Woods describes how the French state gave amnesty to the demostrators, while targeting what it saw as more radical elements with persecution. However, Woods says that the workers were in no mood to negotiate. Asked to ratify the agreed plan between the labor leaders and the state, Woods says the workers outright refused.
  
  # De Gaulle demoralised
  Woods describes the mental anguish of De Gaulle, who was a broken man at this point. He cites the [[USA|US]] ambassador, who says that De Gaulle told him that "the game is up. In a few days the Communists will be in power." 
  
  However, Woods reminds us that De Gaulle still had one card to play - the reformists and Stalinist leadership of the workers could still be relied on.
  
  # Military intervention?
  Woods explains that De Gaulle was certainly intent on using military force if needed against the crowds. However, he says that the military is not immune to the contradictions of society, and that if we judge the state's strength on numbers alone, than revolution would be impossible throughout all time.
  
  Woods cites [[Trotsky]]'s analysis of the Russian military: 
  
  > If an army as a whole is a copy of society, then when society openly splits, both armies are copies of the two warring camps. The army of the possessors contained the wormholes of isolation and decay.

# Crisis of the state
Woods highlights the rumors of mutinies in the French fleet, and quotes even the police unions as being seeting with discontent. 

# Who saved De Gaulle?
Woods explains that faced with destruction, it's no wonder that the French state was willing to give extensive concessions to the workers. Despite the offers, Woods says that the rank-and-file workers were growing more and more aware of their power, and refused to budge when the labor leaders offered to make a deal.

Woods claims that overall, the aim of the PCF and the labor leaders was to control the situation, but that their grasp was weakening.

# Initiative passes to reaction
On May 30th, Woods says that De Gaulle broadcasted a message dissolving the National Assembly and calling new elections, and saying that force would be used to keep order. Woods claims this was a message to the labor leaders, tempting them with seats in the government but letting them know the bourgeoisie wouldn't go down without a fight. 

> [!note]
> However, I think the strength that he would use to defend these elections was nowhere in sight.

Woods claims that the working class cannot be maintaine permanenently in a state of white-hot anger. He says that once the working class is mobilized to change society, it will either succeed or it will fail. 

Woods says that the union leaders were dragging things along, waiting for tiredness to set in to the working class and for the workers to gradually return to work. He elaborates that this strategy did end up working, and that many workers accepted the union leaders' claims that the reforms granted by the government were a victory.

# 1968 was a revolution
Trotsky explains that a revolution is a situation when the masses, who are normally apathetic, begin to participate actively in society, aquire an understanding of their own strength, and take their destinies into their own hands. Woods says that by this definition, the events of May 1968 were a revolution.

Woods calls out the Communist Party, saying that those who should have been providing leadership and a vision of revolution instead suffocated the strikes, and handed power back to the bourgeoisie as quickly as possible in order to ensure their cushy governmental positions.

Woods explains the difference between a strike and a *general* strike. He says that the latter actually asks the question of who really runs society. Wood says that all that was needed in May was for the workers to elect delegates to send to a National Strike Committee, which would have the power to consign the French state to the dustbin of history.

Woods ends the article by saying that while the revolution of 1968 may have ended in defeat, the legacy of those events still lives on, and the events that played out then and there will inevitably be repeated on an even higher level. Woods calls for the formation of a vanguard capable of providing leadership to the masses and finishing the revolution.

> We are striving to prepare the vanguard so that the next time we will be successful. And on this glorious proletarian anniversary we say: _The Revolution is dead. Long live the Revolution!_
