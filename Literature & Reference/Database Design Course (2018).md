# What is a database?
A [[database]] is something that stores [[data]]. Naturally, this leads to the question of what data is. He says it's basically any information. 

All websites require backend databases to keep track of information related to the user and the site. 

While a spreadsheet can store data, they aren't very complex. You can't select based on multiple attributes per datum. 

# What is a relational database?
An entity is anything that we store data about. Attributes are the things we store about the entity. John is an entity, his name and address are seperate attributes about the entity. 

# RDBMS
A [[RDBMS]] is a relational database management system.
