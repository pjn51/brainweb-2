# Speech of the People's Commisar of Foreign Affairs
Trotsky argues that during the Brest-Litovsk negotiations, the outbreak of a massive strike wave across Berlin motivated the [[Germany|German]] delegation to withold concessions, since that would be an implicit recognition of the power of the [[proletariat|working class]]. Trotsky notes that this is an example of the "double-edged" character of class struggle - an upsurge of the working class provokes reaction ([[The Revolutionary Philosophy of Marxism (2018)|RPM]], p373).
