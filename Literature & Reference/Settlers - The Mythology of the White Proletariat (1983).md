> This theory deals with an (imo false) idea of how there is no such thing as a white [[proletariat]] in the [[USA]]. It was written by J. Sakai, and is part of the legacy of [[maoism#third worldism|third worldism]]. I think it is very bad.
## The Land is the Basis of Nationhood
Mythology holds that the early [[USA|American]] settlers were the lower classes of Europe but that isn’t the case. Less than 15% of colonists were proletarian. They were mainly the sons of the middle class tradesmen seeking a profitable existence in America. Moving to North America was a way out of the intense class struggle for land in Europe, where capitalism and the Enclosure Acts were making land ownership more and more difficult.

The colonies had issues with industrial [[labor]] shortages because land was so cheap that workmen would work for a short time, then buy large amounts of land to farm. The cities were empty of workers. 

This shows the class intentions of the settlers, who sought to become [[petty bourgeoisie]] in their ownership of large estates of land for agriculture.

## The Foundations of Settler Life
>“The life of European settlers — and the class structure of their society — was abnormal because it was dependent upon a foundation of conquest, genocide, and enslavement.”

> [!question]
> What is abnormal about this? What of the foundations of society in Europe? Or China for that matter?

The foundation of American society was conquest of the continent. That’s what provided the economic engine for the rapid development of America. 

Colonial mythos often says that the areas that were conquered were empty of people, this is bullshit obviously. 

Once the genocide of the Native Americans was complete, slaves were moved onto the land, another foundation of settler society. Settler society was completely dependent on slave labor for survival. 

>“The mythology suggests that slavery even lowered the living standard of the white masses by supposedly holding down wages and monopolizing vast tracts of farmland. Thus, it is alleged, slavery was not in the interests of the white masses. Similar arguments relative to today are advanced by the "Don't-Divide-The-Working-Class" revisionists, who want to convince us that the Euro-Amerikan masses are "victims of [[imperialism]]" just like us.” 

> [!criticism]
> Oof. Well I disagree with this line of logic. The “Euro-Amerikan masses” may not be as victimized by imperialism as the third world, but that’s no reason to not build a coalition with them if interests are aligned.

Colonies made substantial profits by selling natives as slaves abroad, since they were too familiar with the land to use as slaves locally. The colonies needed [[capital]] infusions from Europe, and slaves were the best good to trade with. 

Within the new African nation, distinct classes were developing. In some states, nearly all the skilled laborers were African. 

The Jeffersonian vision of America was a society without a proletariat - composed of petit bourgeois small farmers in an agrarian society. However, capitalism required a proletariat, so one was imported from Africa. This proletariat benefited all settlers, even those who did not own slaves, since it provided the basis for all of settler society. 

> [!note]
> I agree with most of this chapter. I agree that even those who didn’t own slaves benefited from slavery in a systemic way, but I feel like the author is going to use this fact to say that all settlers have bourgeois class-interests, which I think would be incorrect.

## Euro-Amerikan Social Structure
The author makes 4 claims: 
1. America has no feudal / communal past, and was constructed by the bourgeoisie in their vision. 
2. America began its life as an oppressor nation. 
3. All classes in America are bourgeoisified. 
4. America has no proletariat, and must rely on the proletariat of other nations. 

> [!criticism]
> I agree with #2, but #3 and #4 do not follow from the previous two. As for #1, what about the natives?
> 
> The author claims that every European who wanted to could be a property owner. Is this really true? 
## Euro-American class structure in 1775
80% bourgeois or petit-bourgeois (10% bourgeois, 15% planters, ~40% small farmers)
15% temporary workers (soon to become petit-bourgeois)
5% laborers

> [!note]
> I guess slaves are not included in this breakdown

The rapid turnover and transitory nature of the settler working class left no material basis for the formation of a conscious class. The low cost of land kept wages high, as capitalists had to compete for workers who always had the option of becoming farmers. 

While as much as half of the European immigrants were indentured servants for some time, this was different from slavery because these servants always had their future freedom guaranteed. Many indentured servants went on to join the upper classes, including at one point 15% of the Virginia state legislature. 

Initially, there were some white indentured servants working alongside agricultural slaves, and some cross-racial class [[class consciousness]] was developing. However, the slave market was flooded with Africans, and indentured servitude decreased in frequency. White servants were retained only as overseers and foremen. This signaled an end to any proletarian consciousness among these workers. 

> [!criticism]
> I largely agree with this stuff, but again, I think that this is setting the groundwork for an argument that I will disagree with. The class composition of our society has changed since 1776. 

## Struggles & Alliances
There were temporary alliances between segments of the Euro-Americans and the oppressed nations, but they were tactical and calculated. 

Bacon’s Rebellion was an example of such an alliance. In 1676, slaves and some settlers seized state power in Virginia, defeating Crown soldiers and forcing the governor to flee. Some characterize this as a pro-democracy movement, however Bacon and the other whites involved were really agitating for war against the natives who were standing up to expansion. In the battles between the governor and Bacon, both sides tried to recruit armies of the oppressed by promising them more freedom. This led to the perception of a cross-class coalition. However, there was never going to be any concessions to the oppressed on either side. 

The expansion of democracy and the increased repression of non-citizens often went together. As more groups were admitted into settler society, those left out could expect a greater degree of exploitation and control. 

During the Revolutionary War, the same sorts of temporary concessions were offered to rebel slaves. An estimated 20% of American slaves gained freedom by reaching the British lines. This led the rebels to allow slaves entry into the Army, promising them freedom as well. However, after the war many were refused their freedom. 

> [!criticism]
> I agree with this chapter, however the line between a real political overlap in interests, and a ‘quid-pro-quo’ is a blurry one. Couldn’t you say that the working class only joins in the class struggle as a ‘quid-pro-quo?’ This is important because the author uses the tactical nature of these alliances to say that dissenting elements of the settlers did not have any political unity with the oppressed.

## Crisis Within the Slave System
Settlers began to realize that having millions of the oppressed right in the middle of their society was a bad idea. Jefferson proposed sending all the child slaves back to Africa, and then working all the slaves to death, ending slavery gradually. 

However, this plan didn't work because the slave owners couldn't turn down the profits of slave ownership. Even Jefferson continued to accumulate slaves. 

The [[Haiti|Haitian]] revolution spread more fear of a slave revolt in the [[USA]]. 

A significant number of slaves were part of the urban proletariat. Some failed revolts originated in the cities, which we're becoming more and more dominated by black people. Because of this, slave communities in the cities were broken up, moved back to plantations. In this way, slavery was no longer a progressive economic force in society. It was now holding back development. 

## Slavery vs Settlerism
While slavery was still more profitable than wage-labor, the ruling class recognized the danger of having too lopsided a ratio between oppressed and oppressor at home. They also needed more settlers to settle the western region of the continent, something slaves couldn't accomplish. 

There was now a split in the ruling class. In the north, the bourgeoisie sought to import a white working class to decrease the possibility of a slave revolt. In the south, the bourgeoisie sought to expand the slave system as it was simply too profitable to imagine giving up. The southern bourgeoisie also thought that the development of a white working class would create a split in the white race that could later be exploited. 

## The Rise of White Labor
Some 4 million European immigrants came to the continent between 1830 and 1860. Some say that this was the beginning of the white proletariat, but Sakai disagrees. 

By 1860, the possibility of every European becoming a slave owner one day was over. Most were now wage-laborers. 

Sakai claims that while the outer forms of proletarian consciousness began to appear (leftist politics, unions, etc), this was a privileged stratum of labor. Therefore, he argued that it really developed a petit-bourgeois consciousness. 

> [!note]
> This is a key point, I hope he goes into more detail.

Once again, the pattern appeared that whenever rights were expanded for the white working class, they were constricted for the African. 

> [!criticism]
> This seems like an intentional method to split these two groups, but Sakai frames it as the fault of the white working class (who I guess he doesn't see as a working class really).

The fact that Hitler had to use force to crush the workers in order to seize power, while Andrew Jackson rode to power with the support of white workers shows the different consciousness of the white settlers at this time. Both men favored similar policies in regards to expansion and genocide. 

> [!criticism]
> This is a totally liberal distortion of the idea of fascism, and confusion about what fascism really is... I'm not surprised Sakai subscribes to the concept that fascism is just capitalism but really bad instead of just bad.
> 
> I basically agree with all of this, I see how the white working class was so thoroughly bribed by the bourgeoisie that they had no inkling of real class consciousness. This follows from my understanding of imperialism, and it makes sense because the US was the most imperialist of all nations at the time and therefore had the most loot to bribe the workers with. However it does not follow that all white Americans in 2020 are petit bourgeois.
## The Popular Appeal of Genocide
The civil war mainly emerged as a contradiction within the ranks of the settlers. The question was, will we settle the new lands to the west with whites, or with slaves? This motivated the fierce fighting in Kansas, and later, the war itself. 

Even the abolitionist movement had currents of those who viewed the slave system as "defending" Africans, who would soon go extinct if slavery was abolished, making room for a white society. 

## White Labor Against the Oppressed
New European immigrants were rapidly replacing blacks in the cities. 

White unions used traditional tools like the boycott and strike in order to push Chinese immigrants out of industries on the west coast. 

> [!criticism]
> Sakai said that the participation of the labor movement in genocide shows that it was a degraded stratum of petit bourgeois consciousness that sought extra-proletarian privledges. However, I don't think this is behavior specific to this class. Any class is capable of being bribed by the bourgeoisie, as long as bribes are available. As imperialism progresses, bribes will be less available and therefore the white workers will become a revolutionary force. 

In fact, white workers were often more vicious than the bourgeoise since the later had some use for people of color as a source of labor but white workers did not. 

## The Test of Black Reconstruction
The civil war was really two struggles: a battle between factions of the ruling class for possession of the empire, and an anti colonial struggle waged by the slaves. Neither ended when the Confederacy surrendered. 

The turning point of the war was when slaves began to desert for the northern lines. However, after the war the north began the challenging ready of preventing a slave revolt as land redistribution stalled. 

A strategy emerged of using force against the most politically advanced slaves, and encouraging the rest to submit by giving them the vote and citizenship. 

Black Reconstruction failed due to its contradictions. The northern bourgeoisie wanted to use Blacks to suppress the former confederates, but were also terrified of organizing and arming the Black population too well. Reconstruction was ultimately broken by the mass terror brought by white paramilitary organizations like the KKK.

## Tactical and Strategic
Sakai proclaims that the "settler nature of the Euro-Amerikan oppressor nation" is the uniting feature of both the KKK and [[CPUSA]]. He says that the question of unity can only be answered when this "fact" is taken into account, saying that this question is especially important for Asian-Americans since their population size requires alliances to be formed. 

Sakai brings up a view he degrades as "simple-minded:" that by uniting within the "settler unions," colonized people will be able to win concessions, and will move from tactical unity towards strategic unity with white workers who will "join us as true comrades."

In an attempt to answer the question of strategic and tactical relations, Sakai wants to examine the history of Black-White workers unity, which he says has been used by U.S. Empire to support racial integrationism. 

Sakai thinks that in order to do this, we should look at the "theoretical framework" created by an article, *Message to the Black Liberation Movement.*

Sakai upholds this *Message,* which says that while the tactical goals of White and Black workers overlap, the strategic goals differ, since Black workers have the ultimate goal of national self-determination as a people (through the creation of a socialist Black revolutionary nation), while the White workers labor towards the overthrow of capitalism and the creation of a predominatley White [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]. 

Sakai admits that this message was an important advance, but says it contains contadictions. He believes that the idea of short-term tactical unity between Whites and Blacks is going too far. 

Sakai highlights what he calls "the deep bond" between the Vietnamese Revolution and the guerillas in El Salvador, and says that this is much deeper than a tactical unity. He says that tactical unity can be temporarily maintained between two hostile forces, such as the Chinese Revolution and the USA, during World War Two. 

Sakai asserts that if both Black and White workers were moving towards socialism, then the unity between them would be more than just tactical. However, he says this is not the situation. He asks, "What is the relationship of tactical unity to genocide?"

Sakai brings up the example of the United Mine Workers, which he says was founded in 1890 and contained many Black and White miners. He says this is a clear example of tactical unity that existed for over 90 years between Blacks and Whites. 

However, he claims that in the long run, the White workers were interested in preserving U.S. Empire while the Black workers were interested in overthrowing it. He supports this by claiming that after areas were unionized with the help of Black workers, those same workers were kicked out of the union. He asserts that Blacks were used as the battering ram to take the dangerous work, and then White workers seized the [[unions]] for themselves.

Sakai claims that this was the general policy of the imperialists towards colonial labor - to reserve the best jobs for "Euro-Amerikans in order to ensure the loyalty of settler society."

> [!criticism]
> Overall, Sakai totally fails to see how the tactic of splitting the working class along racial lines, even if it has been successful so far in the US, is a tactic of the ruling class, and doesn't prove that white workers always have been and always will be reactionary. It *certainly* doesn't demonstrate that white workers are somehow not part of the proletariat!
