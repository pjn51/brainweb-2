# Summary
This article goes from worse to better as you read through it. They begin with a weirdly abstract examination of the class character of the [[COVID-19]] lockdown, and try to call the "PMC" out for hypocrisy over their opposition to anti-lockdown protests while they supported BLM. This is not at all a contradiciton, as while the *form* of street protest is the same, the *political character* is entirely different between these two events. 

Then, they begin to examine the role that the middle class functionaries of capital play. Their analysis is fundamentally sound, but they chose to reframe an analysis of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] into an analysis of the professional managerial class. [[The PMC isn't a real class]], and their choice of words here confuses an analysis that is useful when reframed in the correct langauge. 

They conclude by discussing how the petty bourgeoisie cannot play an independent political role, a correct point that they had contradicted earlier by saying that the "PMC" was responsible for the lockdown, and its later halting during the BLM protests. They note how social movements led by these folks tend to misdirect social anger away from the state and [[capitalism]]. 

Finally, they call for the construction of a working class party that abandons the cross class coalitions of the middle classes, which I think is very positive. 

Overall, they seem to be making a good point, but seem trapped in overly academic langauge and keep saying PMC all the time, which makes their argument more confusing. Fundamentally, this is an analysis of the inability of the petty bourgeoisie to play an independent political role, and how they can only act as functionaries of the capitalist class. I still see no reason to use the language of PMC instead of just calling these people petty bourgeois, since that's what they really are.

## Lockdown enthusiasm and the European left
The authors begin by saying that "the spring of 2020 was a great time for the authoritarian personality" because experts were appointed to "simply tell everyone what to do." They argue that the left and left-liberal side of the political spectrum has found a new love of [[state]] rule. 

They also note that this attitude was reflected in the applause given to health workers, except when the latter were on strike. It's unclear who the subject of this line is, the media, the workers, or the "PMC?" 

The authors begin to paint the lockdown measures as anti-worker and argue that the support given to them by the "left-leaning middle classes" is hypocritical since workers with children would find it impossible to homeschool their children while working essential jobs. 

The authors claim that this attitude of the left towards state authority reflects "a radical indifference towards the precariat and underclass." 

The authors begin to argue that the dichotomy of economic growth vs saving lives is a false one, but I can't quite follow their reasoning. They underline the fact that the left seems unable to see the suffering that workers face due to the economic slowdown, and are fixated on their own life situations as they work from home. 

## Social distancing no more: the rise of the middle class levithian
The authors explain how the mood suddenly shifted from "stay home" to "onto the streets" once the [[June 2020 uprising]] began. They note how "punching cops," which they say was characterized as a "white working class hobby in protest of lockdown measures," now became a noble thing to do. 

They say that public health officials who had urged people to stay home now welcomed mass protests in the streets. The authors attempt to call this hypocrisy, asking how doctors could oppose anti-lockdown protests, but support anti-racist protests?

The authors claim that while the insurrection emerged from the "underclass," it was appropriated, first by geography, and then by social stratum. This first appropriation, we are told, happened in the echoes of the protest around the world, where the educated middle class was the leading voice in the solidarity protests in Europe and Australia. In passing, they make the claim that the identification of the political elite with "anti-racism" is abhorrent to the working class. 

The authors say that the second appropriation demonstrated that there was a new actor on the scene: the PMC. The authors make the claim that the PMC were responsible for enforcing the lockdown, and then lifting it. They argue that the PMC is the most ideologically powerful class today, "which widely determines political and media debates, decisions, legal implementations, and reception of events, historical or actual." 

## The party system as the echo chamber of the levithian
The authors frame the classic Social Democratic and "post-Stalinist" parties as the "corporatist integration of the workers as a class within bourgeois society" and say that the modern center left represents a "playground for the fractured middle strata." 

They also note that the modern working class has returned to an atomized mass increasingly unfamiliar with basic forms of organization. 

The authors note that the inability of the working class to aspire to political power also takes [[fascism]] and serious reaction off the table, because the latter were responses to a global movement for proletarian rule. Without an enemy, the authors continue, this movement is unable to maintain momentum.

By the same token, the authors say, the movement of left liberalism, including [[feminism]], anti-ableism, and multiculturalism is unable to find a suitable enemy and fails to present itself as anything besides "passive submission to the dictatorship of capital." 

The authors pose the emergence of a reaction to this trend in the form of "populism," saying that this affects some layers of the middle class and working class. The authors argue that these layers feel bereft of economic stability and even the cultural valorization previously afforded to them, which is now reserved for chosen minorities. 

The authors note that while populism in power is just business as usual, the left liberals cry fascism. However, the authors continue, the real difference between liberalism and populism is an aesthetic one. 

> If the Chinese ruling class is compelled by its mode of exercising hegemony to conceal its factional differences behind an image of monolithic unity, Western democracy conceals its monolithic unity behind an increasingly dramatic image of existential combat.

## Social movements as mobilization campaigns and the levithian as "transmission belt"
The authors make the surprisingly correct point that the middle class cannot play an independent political role. The authors remark that in the absence of a workers' movement, political movements spearheaded by this strata will ultimately serve the interests of the bourgeoise. 

The authors explain that just as [[Lenin]] referred to the trade [[unions]] as a transmission belt between the the proletarian vanguard and the masses, the institutions of civil society function as the transmission belt between the desires of finance capital and the disorganized working class. 

The authors criticize both the sectarian left's elevation of the fight against oppression over class politics, and the "spontaneist" worship of the working class' expression of its own disorganization, reflected in the scattered and instinctive attacks on its enemies. They argue that both converge in subordinating the workers' movement to the goals of bourgeois democracy. 

To those who wish for a return to the "good old days" of Social Democracy and the establishment of workers as a sort of estate to be bought off, the authors remark that this state of affairs only emerged as a side-effect of the revolutionary struggle. 

## Back to basics
The authors call for the construction of a party that can help develop a working class aware of its own interests in breaking with capitalism and the state. They say that such a force would be "a protracted and dynamic relation between mass democracy and centralized leadership" and that this organization "progressively displaces the petty bourgeois in leadership over civil society, it advances towards unmediated antagonism against the state." 

The authors say that such a party can only be built through systematic activity in neigborhoods and workplaces to build "democratic and independent organizations of economic struggle."
