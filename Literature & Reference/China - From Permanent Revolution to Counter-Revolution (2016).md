## The Rise of the Second Chinese Revolution
### Introduction
Roberts outlines [[Stalin]]'s reductive view of bourgeois revolutions, and the idea that the national bourgeoisie in [[China]] was a revolutionary force since China had not had a bourgeois revolution. 

The author says that this perspective was based on the idea that all the classes in China had more in common with one another than they had with the imperialists. He says that those who had this perspective were making the same mistake that [[Lenin]] and [[Bolsheviks]] made with their slogan "the Revolutionary Democratic Dictatorship of the [[proletariat]] and [[peasantry]]," which Lenin firmly rejected in 1917 when he saw the potential to move towards a socialist revolution in [[Russia]]. 

Roberts says that this perspective led the [[CPC]] to attempt to harness the 'revolutionary potential' of the national bourgeoisie, vested in the [[Kuomintang]]. However, Roberts points out that the KMT and its leadership understood that they shared different interests than the communists, and massacred them at the first opportunity. 

Roberts slams [[Stalin]] and the CPC for continuing with their failed United Front tactics even after the massacre. By the end of 1927, Roberts points out, the vast majority of the 60,000 members of the CPC would leave the party or be dead. 

### Chiang Kai-shek's First Coup: 20 March 1926
Roberts explains that after Sun Yat Sen's death on March 12th, sections of the Chinese capitalist class came out openly against the inclusion of Communists in the KMT's alliance. The author says that the reason for this urgent move was the rising strike movement led by the working class in Hong Kong. 

Roberts points to the events of the previous year, where the left wing of the KMT (including the Communists) had made major gains among the Hong Kong workers, rising to control Hong Kong. He says that this explains the determination that the national bourgeoisie had in seeking the expulsion and extermination of the Communists. 

The author emphasizes that there was a principled left resistance to the hardening of the right. He points to Peng Shuzhi's stance that the national bourgeoisie was too closely tied to the forces of imperialism to lead a successful revolution for national independence. Here we can see behavior that would be called '[[Trotskyism]]' today. 

Roberts says that as the left wing of the KMT rose to power, Chiang struck back using the armed forces, who leaned to the right. He says that Chiang arrested the Soviet advisors, CPC members in the KMT military forces, and he closed down the trade union premises throughout Hong Kong. 

Roberts criticizes the deformation of the Soviet Union evidenced in the fact that they covered up this event, seeking to prop up Chiang as a 'defender of the national revolution.' 

### Outcomes of the Coup
Again, Roberts strongly critiques the failure of the USSR and the CPC to see the warning signs. Instead, he characterizes their response to the coup as one of cover up and deliberate inaction. Roberts says that the Communists failed to expose him as an agent of the bourgeoisie, instead insisting that he was a revolutionary. 

Roberts outlines how Chiang used the CPC's inability to leave the party as leverage to destroy them. Chiang demanded that the CPC limit its criticism, reveal a full list of members (!), and not engage in political activity without permission from the KMT. 

It's shocking that the CPC agreed to this, and this is absolutely damning evidence that the leadership of the CPC, and the USSR to whom they looked for guidance, were totally dead intellectually by this point. How could you not see that Chiang was preparing for a bloodbath!

From this point on, Roberts claims that the CPC was in fact a brake on the Chinese Revolution. However, he points out that for many members who were bombarded with propaganda claiming that a break with the KMT would spell disaster, these sacrifices appeared worthwhile. 

Roberts explains how the shift rightward emboldened the landlords to begin attacking peasants and their leaders who had agitated for expropriation. Again, the author blames the CPC for not correctly calling out landlordism as the culprit, choosing instead to blame specific corrupt officials or hooligans. 

### The Northern Expedition: From Guangdong to Shanghai

### Peasants and Workers Self-Mobilize
Roberts says that despite the negative role played by the CPC, the Chinese proletariat and peasantry was moving into action anyway. He explains how behind the NRA, the peasants spontaneously organized to demand a reduction in rents. Once this reduction was won, the peasants tended to take the obvious next step and refuse to pay any rent at all. 

The author also highlights the strike wave that was occuring in all the major cities alongside the peasant revolts. In Hunan, trade membership doubled to 150,000. The movement was also becoming political. Roberts says that workers in Hankau spontaneously seized the British Concession, tearing down the barbed wire with no leadership from the KMT or CPC whatsoever. 

Roberts says that the CPC actually called the above action incorrect, and had even moved to the right of the local KMT representatives on this question.
