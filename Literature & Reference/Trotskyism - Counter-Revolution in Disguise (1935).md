# Introductory
The author begins by claiming that the murder of Kirov was caused by the assasin's "education in counter-revolution in the [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]]-[[Zinoviev]] organization."

He goes on to uncritically reprint the "confessions" extracted at the Moscow Trials as fact, saying that "once more a gigantic surge of hatred rose among the millions of friends of the Soviet Union the world over for this man, Trotsky."

Olgin advises us that this book will examine who Trotsky is, what [[Trotskyism]] is, the social roots of that ideology, and the international role of Trotskyists. 

# Trotsky's career
The author begins by claiming that Trotsky allied with the [[Mensheviks]], and despite when he "agreed with this or that point of the Bolshevik program," he fought against Bolshevism for most of his political career.

As if on cue, just a paragraph later, the author says that the fact that Trotsky was in the leadership of this Soviet demonstrates that he was allied with all sorts of non-socialist elements. Olgin goes on to cite somebody named Pokrovsky, who says that Trotsky was against armed insurrection and wanted to prevent the overthrow of Tsarism.
