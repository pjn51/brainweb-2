# Review
This book was apparently called a disappointing sequel to [[Dune (1965)]]. I disagree! After building Paul up into a demigod with the ability to see the future, where else is there to go but to show the negative effects of such power? It made his character far more interesting when he demonstrated the cynicism that came with choosing the least-terrible future over and over. 

I think a main thread of this book, and the ones that come after, is that [[Effect becomes cause]]. We see the rise of Paul in the first book, and then this book describes what happens when a figure like Paul "wins" and rules the Empire.
