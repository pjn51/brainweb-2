# Review
I was immediately drawn to this book because it can be read in multiple ways. It can be read front to back, but the author suggests following a convoluted pattern of chapters instead, which is listed on the first page. 

I get the sense that I could open this book to any page and get a beautiful experience reading it. The language is almost like poetry. 

I'm not sure if I'll end up finishing this book, because the writing is honestly too dense to really get through. It's meandering and it seems like not much has happened in the first 70 pages or so.
