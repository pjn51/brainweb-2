# How To Take Smart Notes (2017)
`TAGS:` #book

---
This is a famous book on [[PKM]]. 

- [[Abstractions make the best idea notes]]
- [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]] when it comes to developing topics to write about. 

Ahrens argues that detecting contradictions between ideas is an important source of insight (116). 

Incorporating the principle of how [[Quantity transforms into quality]], Ahrens says that most breakthroughs are preceded by long periods of preparation (121). This is the way in which he resolves the contradiction between the apparent "spark of insight" and the fact that it takes a lot of grinding to get to the point where such an instantaneous flash is possible. 

Explaining how one can be creative within the slip-box, the author says that we must first liberate ideas from their context and abstract them in order to be able to re-apply them to other situations and connect them with other contexts (123). I think this demonstrates how [[Abstraction is essential to human thought]], and how [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. This also supports the idea that [[Abstractions make the best idea notes]]. 

# Advantages of Zettelkasten
The author says that [[A Zettelkasten can act as a thinking partner]]. 

# Workflow
Ahrens says that [[Good productivity routines allows for flow]], and that [[Luhmann's workflow was important]] to the process, and has been overlooked in favor of a focus on his Zettelkasten. In his workflow, Ahrens moves from fleeting notes, to literature notes, to permanent notes in his general workflow. Beginning with fleeting notes, he writes whatever comes to mind as a temporary measure to avoid forgetting important information, or as a reminder of what to come back to. From these notes and reminders, he writes more structured literature notes. He advises that these notes be short, selective, and in our own words. Finally, he explains that the next step is to abstract the essential, free standing ideas from these concepts and turn them into independent notes that connect to each other in our slip box (23). The author also argues that we should [[Prefer systems to goals]], because [[Volition is a finite resource]]. In this argument, he mirrors James Clear's idea that we don't rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems. [1]. 

# Learning
Ahrens says that the best learning method is *elaboration,* the application of an idea to new concepts, and the extension of the idea past the original framing of it. He argues that his workflow allows for such elaboration (89). Therefore, [[To learn, elaborate and summarize]], because [[Summarization requires comprehension]], and elaboration helps us connect and cement knowledge. He argues that [[Learning is collaborative]] and that explaining an idea is critical to our own understanding. 

# Sorting
Ahrens discusses the best way to sort our notes. He argues that too much learning can actually impede learning, and advises us to focus on elaborating the similarities and differences between notes, rather than focusing on categorizing them (106). Implicitly, he supports the notion that we should [[Build scaffolding, not cages]]. He goes on to explain that [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]. Turning to the way that Luhmann organized his index, the author says that Luhmann chose only one or two notes per keyword in his index (109), and chose them sparsely, with an eye towards *retrieval* rather than *categorization.* Elaborating on this distinction, Ahrens invites us to [[Organize information for retrieval]] when we organize our notes (110). This is all quite relevant to my question: [[How should my index be organized?]]
