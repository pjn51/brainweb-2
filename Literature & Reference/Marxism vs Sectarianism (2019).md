The article begins by explaining that [[opportunism]] and [[sectarianism]] are two sides of the same coin, and it's only natural that in an epoch of [[reformism]], some would turn to [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] [[sectarianism]] as a misguided attempt to course correct (PDF, p.1). 

Outlining the reason for this article, the authors say that we must arm ourselves against sectarianism in the aftermath of an attempted disruption of the [[IMT]] by [[Spartacist League]] offshoot, the IG (Ibid, p.1). 

The authors explain that in the last analysis, we're dealing with the difference between [[Marxism]] and formalism, [[dialectics]] versus formal logic, and scientific socialism versus unscientific dogmatism (Ibid, p.2). 

# The importance of dialectics and Marxist theory
Discussing the tasks of the IMT, the article states that the art of building a Marxist group is maintaining a high political level while seizing opportunities to grow - requiring a patient approach that dispells the confusion of the mass movement (Ibid, p.2). 

The article describes opportunism and sectarianism as fundamentally [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] tendencies which we should defend against via an education in the method fo Marxism (Ibid, p.2). 

# "Freedom of criticism"
The authors argue that the hallmark of [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]] is an "unwavering, principled class independence on all political questions, combined with infinite tactical flexibility," and explain that this is backed by an organizational method of [[democratic centralism]]. They outline how [[Democratic centralism allows for freedom of debate, unity of action]] (Ibid, p.3). This is restating the idea that [[Bolshevism requires firmness on content, flexibility on form]]. 

Discussing the sectarian organizational method, the article says that sectarians feel the need to "go into writing" on any and all questions, and the discussion should continue as long as they wish. The authors draw parallels with [[Lenin|Lenin's]] critique of the revisionist "freedom of criticism" defense in [[What is to be Done (1902)]] (Ibid, p.3). This also reminds me of how [[The petty bourgeoisie prefers endless debate]]. 

# The Marxist method
The authors assert that theory, first generalized from practical experience, must be connected back to reality in order to be useful. Instead, they explain, sectarians treat theory as eternally fixed and use it as a purity test - the very opposite of Bolshevism (Ibid, p.3). In other words, [[Thought and activity are inseperable]], [[Action verifies perception]], and [[The metaphysical mode of analysis has limitations]].
