> This is a book by Trotsky discussing the reasons for the failure of the Spanish revolution, through a critique of a publication known as *Que Faire.*
Trotsky asks us to consider the state of the working class movement based on its ideological confusion. He calls out the journal *Que Faire* in Paris as being one of the confused organs of the left, saying that it remains "completley within the framework" of bourgeois metaphysics.

He says that this journal tried to hang on the coattails of the [[POUM]], because that seemed to be the route to the masses and victory. However, Trotsky says that the ties with the POUM actually dragged the publication downward in terms of clarity.

Trotsky wants to dwell on this publication, not because it's important, but because it's reflective of a broader symptom, especially when we look at its coverage of the [[Spain|Spanish revolution]]. 

## *Que Faire* Explains
Trotsky begins by analyzing the publication's review of a pamphlet on the betrayal of the workers in Spain. The review critiques the pamphlet for saying that the workers flocked to the Communist Party because there was no truly revolutionary party, and that the false policy of the CP led to the defeat of the workers. The review calls this "demonology," and says that it implies the conclusion that we should despair that God didn't send a [[Lenin]] or a Trotsky to Spain. 

Trotsky begins his critique of the review by asking us to question why there is no explanation given for the failure of the Spanish revolution within it. Trotsky says that these kinds of "critics of Bolshevism" are cowards and flinch when asked to provide their own explanations. He says that "they confine themselves to hints and half-thoughts as if they just haven't the time to deliniate their full wisdom."

I've seen the above position a lot actually. Lots of fluff and critique of other positions, no real meat of an alternative. Particularly from [[postmodernism]]. Related to this is the idea that [[Asking questions without proposing an answer is annoying]]. 

Trotsky breaks down *Que Faire's* argument step by step. Trotsky says that *Que Faire's* argument is as follows: a false policy of the masses developed out of the immaturity of the working class and the lack of independence of the [[peasantry]]. Trotsky says this is a tautology, and that an "immature" working class is defined as one that follows false policies, and therefore the argument is circular. He says that the important question of who initiated the false policy, and the actual content of the policy, is passed over silently. 

## Sophistry of the Betrayers
Trotsky gives us an overview of the situation of the Spanish workers in 1936. He says that the workers had spontaneously created militias, and factory committees throughout the country. He says that the leadership of the working class was playing a counter-revolutionary role, with the POUM working to subjugate the organs of working class power under the bourgeois state, and dissolve the militias. 

Trotsky points out that far from following a "false program," the workers were choosing the revolutionary line. He says that *Que Faire* assumes that the working class must reach a point of "absolute maturity" where it requires no revolutionary leadership, and can actually overthrow its own leadership. Trotsky says such maturity is impossible. 

Trotsky goes on to ask, "If the workers had a correct revolutionary instinct, why did they subordinate themselves to such leadership?" He says that there was no such subordination, and that the workers were only held back by the leadership through brute force. 

Turning to the topic of [[Anarchism]], Trotsky says that in May the workers in Catalonia rose up against the wishes of their leadership in the [[CNT-FAI]]. The only reason that this uprising failed, in Trotsky's view, is because of the POUM's leadership. 

> One must understand exactly nothing in the sphere of the inter-relationships between the class and the party, between the masses and the leaders in order to repeat the hollow statement that the Spanish masses merely followed their leaders. The only thing that can be said is that the masses who sought at all times to blast their way to the correct road found it beyond their strength to produce in the very fire of battle a new leadership corresponding to the demands of the revolution.

## The Dialectic Approach
Trotsky begins by building on the liberal saying of "Every people gets the government it deserves." He points to the examples of the same 'people' getting multiple different governments in a short span of time, like in [[Russia]] or [[Germany]]. He asks us why this is possible, and replies that it is possible because 'the people' are made up of multiple hostile classes, and the classes are made up of multiple layers which often have different political leaderships. 

Trotsky says that governments don't represent the maturity of the people as a whole, but are a product of the class struggle, the struggles internal to each class, and external forces such as wars and global economic phenomenae. 

Importantly, Trotsky points out that a government created by a certain combination of forces may live on past the expiration of these forces. He says that this is why revolutions are possible and necessary to update the government to the current balance of class forces. 

Trotsky applies this dialectic approach to the leadership of the working class. He says that the leaders of the working class arise out of the conflict between the various strata, amidst the friction of them. He says that once a leadership is established, the leaders tend to rise above the class and become subject to forces from the other classes, and that this can lead to their degeneration. This supports the idea that [[Proletarian leaders become subject to alien class forces]]. 

Trotsky says that the workers may tolerate a degenerated leadership for a long time, since it is only during great events that the leaders get a chance to expose their own inadequacy. During these great events, Trotsky says the contradiction between the workers and their leaders is exposed, and the workers cannot improvise a new leadership out of thin air. [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]]. 

For Trotsky, this demonstrates the crucial need to have Marxist cadres ready to "utilize the collapse of the old leading party." To me, this also demonstrates the importance of Marxist independence from the degenerated leadership that the workers may have. If the workers see the Marxists as part of the old leadership, they'll look right over us when searching out a new way forward. 

## How the Russian Workers Matured
Trotsky demonstrates that the question of maturity is far from a static question. He explains that even in March 1917, the Russian [[proletariat]] was very heterogenous, with only a small minority following the lead of [[Bolsheviks]]. However, he reminds us that only five months later, the Bolsheviks had secured the trust of the vast majority of the workers and had seized power. 

Trotsky says the only real asset of Bolshevism was their clear conception of revolution given to them by Lenin. He says that because of the fact that Lenin's view was confirmed by event after event, the cadres began to trust Lenin, and the advanced workers began to trust the Bolsheviks. In Trotsky's view, it was this process, carried through from the advanced workers to the larger layers of the proletariat, down through the advanced peasants, that was able to gather support around the Bolsheviks and allow for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. 

As for the question of Lenin, Trotsky says that he didn't fall from the sky. Trotsky says that Lenin personified the revolutionary traditions of the working class. Furthermore, Trotsky says that without cadres to carry Lenin's slogans forward to the masses, his ideas wouldn't have found an echo. 

Trotsky critiques *Que Faire* for trying to substitute an abstract, static equation of maturity for the dynamic, dialectical process that he describes when talking about the relationship of the leaders, the party, the class, and the masses. 

## Relativity of "Maturity"
Trotsky says that while the October revolution was a serious testimonial to the maturity of the proletariat, such maturity is relative. He says that within a decade, the same Russian proletariat allowed their revolution to be smothered by a bureaucratic clique. 

Trotsky points out that if the Bolsheviks had failed to utilize revolutionary crisis to mobilize the masses, if they had failed to propel the workers forward and show them that the enemy could be defeated once and for all, then the embryonic soviets would have been crushed by counter-revolution, and the academics would be saying that the idea of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in Russia was only a dream, that the workers were far too immature. 

## Auxiliary Role of Peasants
Trotsky now turns his fire on *Que Faire's* statement on the "lack of independence" of the peasantry. He asks where these people have ever seen an independent peasantry weilding a revolutionary program? 

Turning to Spain, Trotsky points out that the Spanish peasants fought bravely in many situations, but they needed the workers to set an example by decisively rising up against the [[bourgeoisie]]. He says this never happened due to the paralysis of the workers' organizations. 

## The Role of Personality
Trotsky says that *Que Faire* substitutes "mechanistic determinism for the dialectic conditioning of the historical process." He says this is why there are cheap shots taken referring to the role of individuals in Spain. 

Trotsky says that history is a process of the class struggle, but classes don't bring all of their forces onto the battlefield automatically or simultaneously. He elaborates that classes create specific organs through which play an independent role to some extent. This means that they can be subject to individual personality and deformation according to Trotsky. 

For example, Trotsky says that if Lenin had not been able to make it back to Russia in April 1917, the revolution would have happened on a very different basis. Trotsky compares the class struggle with war, saying that at the decisive moments, the decisions of individual commanders can turn the tide of battle. If this wasn't the case, Trotsky asks us why we even bother engaging with politics and programs at all. 

## [[Stalinism]] in Spain
*Que Faire* asks why the masses left their old leaders and rallied to the deformed Communist Party. Trotsky replies that the masses never broke with their old organizations, they merely observed and checked the CP. He says that in general, workers hesitate to break with the organizations that brought them into struggle for the first time. 

Furthermore, Trotsky says that the existence of the People's Front lulled the workers into complacency. Since everyone agreed, Trotsky says, then the workers thought everything must be fine. 

As the party representing the only successful proletarian revolution, Trotsky says it's no wonder that the masses had faith in the [[Comintern]]. Since the ComIntern was the most zealous champion of the People's Front, he says that the workers were more trusting of the concept of working with the bourgeoisie. 

Trotsky ridicules *Que Faire* for seeming to believe that the masses choose a leadership like a person chooses shoes in a store. He says that the real decision is a gradual one, occurring across a whole series of stages, and that the options are very limited. 

Trotsky says that during a revolution, a small party can indeed grow to become important. However, he says that this must be on a foundation of a clear revolutionary theory, and staunch cadres. He elaborates that such a party must also be formed before the revolution begins.

## Treachery of the POUM
Trotsky says that the POUM stood to the left of all the other groups, and had the following of revolutionary workers who weren't tied to anarchism. However, Trotsky says that this party dealt the fatal blow to the revolution when it subjugated itself to the bourgeois parties by participating in the People's Front. 

Trotsky says that there are explanations for every bad decision the POUM made, but that doesn't absolve it of the negative role it played, as a brake on revolution. 

## Responsibility of Leadership
Trotsky says that the biggest sin of *Que Faire* is the absolution of the responsibility of the leaders for the failure of the Spanish revolution. He says that the leaders offload all blame onto the working class, who the leaders brutally crushed again and again as the workers tried to take the revolutionary road. 

Trotsky points out that if the deterministic idea that class struggle is determined solely by the balance of class forces, struggle would be automatic and parties unnecessary. 

>Naturally, the “condition of class forces” supplies the foundation for all other political factors; but just as the foundation of a building does not reduce the importance of walls, windows, doors, roofs, so the “condition of classes” does not invalidate the importance of parties, their strategy, their leadership.

## Repression of Spanish Revolution
Trotsky says that the coalition of "imperialists, Spanish republicans, socialists, anarchists, Stalinists, and on the left flank, the POUM" was forced to use violent repression in order to dispose of the Spanish revolution. 

Trotsky calls out the POUM as the most confused in their opposition to the revolution, and the Stalinists as the most resolute and determined. 

Trotsky says that for the benefit of the [[UK]] and [[France]], the USSR proclaimed the Spanish revolution as bourgeois. He says that this is the foundation on which the People's Front was created, pointing out that even if the Spanish revolution *was* bourgeois, this would still have been a terrible strategy.
