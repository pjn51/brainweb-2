# Topics:
# Cadre training
Cannon says that [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] [[cadre]] are trained through a combination of theoretical education and practical education in the workers' movement (257). However, I think he views the utility of cadre in a simplistic manner, saying that all a revolutionary movement needs is sufficient cadre, regardless of material conditions.  

# Entryism
Cannon justifies the use of [[entryism]] througout the book. He explains that fusion with non-proletarian organizations is ok as long as the Marxists aren't constituting a party. This is how he justifies the "French turn" of the Trotskyists in [[France]] (231). Later, he discusses the entrance of the [[USA|American]] Trotskyists into the Socialist Party in 1936 (282). 

# Epistemology
Cannon agrees with the Marxist stance, that [[Action verifies perception]]. He relates this to political questions, saying that the results of the entrance to the SP verified the validity of the tactic (305). 

# External conflict between parties
I think Cannon has a bit of a bloodthirsty attitude towards other parties. He says that the Socialist Party was an obstacle in the path of the movement, and needed to be destroyed (258). He also remarks that "Every other party is a rival. Every other party is an obstacle."

# Internal conflict in the party
Cannon seems to see expulsion as a valid tactical weapon to ensure the integrity of the party. He says that once petty bourgeois or other threatening groups can be isolated from the rest of the party, they ought to be expelled in the same way that a doctor might amputate an infected finger (243). 

Cannon argues that informal gatherings of comrades can fan the flames of factionalism when there are issues being hotly debated in the party (247). I agree that [[Informal party gatherings can promote factionalism]], but I think discussion should be promoted in general, and can be useful. 

Cannon criticizes those who prioritize their friendships above political clarity, saying that the best thing you could do for a friend is to get them back on the right path (280). 

# Leadership
Cannon says "The task of political leadership is to understand what is possible and necessary in a given situation, and what is not possible and not necessary" (284). This is related to [[The dialectic of freedom and necessity]]. 

# Splits and fusions
Cannon explains the tactical use of splits and fusions, saying that these are both questions of tactics, and preserving the largest possible combination of Bolsheviks, while retaining contact with new layers of workers and youth entering the struggle (234). 

He also says that such events are more likely to lead to clarification during intense events, as that's when incorrect programs and party lines are revealed most clearly (236). This can be explained because of the fact that [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], and the fact that [[Crisis reveals petty bourgeois elements within the workers' movement]].

> Written by James [[Cannon]], this theory is a history of the development of [[trotskyism]] from 1928 to 1938 in the United States.
# 1: The first days of American communism
The Trotskyist movement really began in the US in 1928.

## Introduction
The Socialist Workers Party ([[SWP (USA)]]) was the Trotskyist party of the time. It had grown out of the Communist Party of the United States, which had grown out of the Socialist Party, which had grown out of the [[IWW]]. 

The chief struggle during the start of the [[CPUSA]] was the struggle against opportunism, which was then represented by the Socialist Party. This is a classic case of the deterioration of an original organization giving birth to a radical wing, which then splits to become its own organization. 

This new organization, the CPUSA, was still oriented towards the old, seeking to gain members from the Socialist Party. 

At the time, the Socialist Party was very confused and heterogenous. There was very little theoretical clarity or education to be found. This set a weak foundation for those brought into the struggle through this Party. Without a clear doctrine of Marxism, there is no revolutionary clarity or scientific basis for struggle. 

## Leaders and Policies of the Pioneer Communist Movement in United States
The leaders of the Russian revolution were not merely men of action, but great theoreticians. 

Many socialists at this time were immigrants who had brought socialist ideas from Eastern Europe to [[USA|America]] with them. These immigrants were organized in the Socialist Party along the lines of language federations. 

The domination of the leaders of these blocs helped to inculcate the ideas of Bolshevism, but it made the movement too focused on Russia and Europe and not focused on the US. 

Ironically, immigrants had much more sway in the organization than native-born Americans at this time. Many immigrant leaders thought Americans weren’t capable of being authentic Bolsheviks. 

The organization of two separate organizations began to take shape. There was a more decentralized, federated one that was dominated by the language blocs, and a more centralized one dominated by Americans. Their programs were identical, but they fiercely battled for control. 

At the same time, fierce persecution drove the movement underground. From 1919 to 1922 the movement would exist only in secret. This disconnect from mass work led to a surge of ultra-leftism. 

 When Eugene Debs ran for president in 1920, the Communists refused to support him since he was part of the Socialist Party. This was a mistake. Instead, the Communists called for a boycott of the elections. This anti-electoralism would pervade the organization for a long time. The party also developed a bias towards underground work, which is irrational. 

## The Deadly Virus of Ultra-Leftism in American Communism’s Early Days
Working as a legal organization is much easier. It’s easier to come into contact with prospective members and grow the organization. However, many years of underground existence had made the Communists think that this was some sort of virtue or principle. Therefore, they would make no maneuvers to work in the open. 

In 1920, at the CPUSA convention, a resolution was made to boycott the AFL. This was ultra-left nonsense, of course. However, there were many positive features of the CPUSA despite the bad. Thousands were dedicated to the cause of revolution, and the leadership reflected this. 

There was also a good tradition of education in the CPUSA during this time. However, stagnation was creeping in since the party was so isolated from the masses. A new faction formed, seeking a way to work legally. They slowly gained supporters, and started a few legal lecture groups. In the end, the Workers Party was made legal while the Communist Party remained illegal. Most members still refused to submit to the bounds of legality. Through the Workers Party, the communists were able to publish propaganda and meet many more contacts. 

 Some wanted to forgo the illegal organization altogether, and bet that the wave of liberal sentiment that was washing the country would protect them from persecution for the time being. These people were called ‘liquidators,’ after the group of Mensheviks who wanted to confine the RSDLP to legal work only, however this comparison was mechanical.

# 2: Factional Struggles in the Old Communist Party
## The Great Positive Contributions of the Pioneer Communist Movement
The negative aspect of the early movement was overshadowed by the positive qualities of the organization. This was the first American party founded on the basis of Bolshevism. They were disciplined, theoretically educated, and ready to begin the work. 

The first challenge for the new CP was the struggle for supremacy with the IWW. 

During the pre-war era, the IWW was the largest proletarian organization. Its members were militant and hardened from decades of struggle, while the CP had come out of the Socialist Party. Members of the CP were often petty bourgeois, young, and inexperienced. 

However, the IWW underestimated the CP. The ideas and theory of the CP was more correct than the IWW. Within a few years, the CP was now the vanguard of the workers’ movement. The IWW proved unable to adapt to new conditions created by the war and by the Russian revolution. 

The CP was now in the open as a legal party, and had turned from an orientation inward to the policy of mass work. 

Trade unionists began to take interest in the party, with many joining. The CP began to take its first baby steps in the AFL, which was the sole labor organization at that time. 
The CP correctly ascertained that it had to direct its power towards the reactionary trade unions instead of forming radical unions. 

Because of this correct tactic, the CP began to gain support among some unions around the country, like the coal unions. 

Unfortunately, the CP overcorrected its previous error of holding back, of ultra-leftism. It engaged in some opportunistic behavior in the realm of labor struggles, without the dedicated backing of a mass movement that would be required, and before the CP was strong enough to take on such challenges. This began a new internal struggle. 

A new period of factional struggle began in 1923, and would rage all the way until the Trotskyists were expelled in 28 and beyond. 

These fights were fierce, but they didn't prevent the CP from doing good work in the meantime. They established a daily paper and led virtually every serious strike in the US. 

Factional fights should be examined to deduce general rules so that one can predict these kinds of things. 

Factional fights are inevitable, and common to all political organizations. 

## Causes of factional struggles
The overwhelming majority came to the CP with honest intentions. There were really no spoils to fight over in terms of the CP’s leadership positions. 

Engels wrote that internal conflict is the law of development of every political party. 
The CP’s leadership rapidly switched positions as the organization consolidated. After four or five years of flux, a stable-ish leadership emerged that reflected the internal contradictions of the CP. Instead of a central leadership that had authority over the whole of the party, the leadership was made up of the leaders of various factions. 

Our author and others were part of a faction oriented towards the trade unions, with support of most of the American workers in the CP.

The Lovestone group had more intellectuals, and had most of the foreign-born members. They were more educated in theory, but had less experience in the struggle.

One initial struggle was over the location of HQ. The Lovestone group wanted NYC, the Cannon group said Chicago. At the time, the CP in NY had more of a petty bourgeois and immigrant character. That’s why the Lovestone group wanted it to be the HQ, while the Cannon group wanted Chicago in order to Americanize the party. 

The Cannon group (what he calls the proletarian faction) was very confused at first, and made many mistakes. They had no experience in politics, and had just recently become acquainted with the theory and practice of Bolshevism. However, they were the progressive force in the party. 

The Cannon group was stratified on the interior as well. There was a wing, led by Cannon, who were mainly pioneer Communists who had been party men since the beginning. However, there was another wing, led by Foster, who were trade unionists. 
This internal split culminated in the formation of three CP factions. There was the Lovestone group, the Cannon group, and now the Foster group. 

Lovestone, his ally Ruthenberg, Cannon, and Foster always sat on the Political Committee of the CP. The weight of the party was divided so evenly between the three factions that even when one got a majority, it couldn't dispense with the other factions without destroying the CP. 

The Foster faction controlled the trade union work of the party, Cannon controlled the International Labor Defense organization, Lovestone controlled the party as a whole but weakly. Each faction was able to more-or-less independently run their part of the organization. 

There was a real stalemate between the three factions, to the point which the CP of that time should really be called a coalition of three smaller parties. This was very demoralizing to most comrades, but some relished the internal struggles at the expense of the real revolutionary work. However, reports that the CP was full of scoundrels are unfounded. Most were genuine revolutionaries. 

The solution for the petty squabbles and factionalism that overtook some parts of the CP should have been guidance from the national center or from an international center. If the Communist International had reached out to help, the problems could have been solved. Unfortunately, the CI was the source of this degeneration. 

Instead of trying to end the feud, the CI was trying to keep things riled up with the goal of using the tumult as a way of dealing with enemies in the party. 

The International really wanted a docile arm of the Soviet bureaucracy that they could use for Soviet foreign policy goals. With this in mind, they wanted to erase all traces of genuine thought and independent thinkers. 

The American CP would go to Moscow for the convention and would leave disappointed, without any clarity on the issues they had brought. The Comintern would always support the petty bourgeois Lovestone faction over all others, even in the face of general support of the rank-and-file for the proletarian faction. The Soviets especially wanted to break up the Cannon faction, and would use their prestige to weaken his support by calling out every tiny mistake of his by proclamation in the grand halls of the convention in order to weaken his support. 

As the Soviet campaign against Trotskyism developed, the leadership of the various CPs around the world was selected to be whoever railed loudest against Trotsky. 

The Comintern would send the US delegation back to America with resolutions designed to heat the factional fight to a boil. This was a real issue since the majority of members deeply trusted the Comintern. 

Some say that the faith the American Communists had in the Soviets was a sign of their weakness. False! The Russians had just made a revolution, and the reverence in which they were held by the rest of the international was totally justified. There is no such thing as even development within an international organization. The more fresh sections ought to look to the example set by the more experienced. 

After the Trotskyists of the Cannon faction were expelled in 1928, the Comintern organized the expelling of the Lovestone group in ‘29. After that, the only ones left were hodgepodge elements of the Foster trade unionist group who swore uncritical loyalty to [[Stalin]] and the USSR. 

The Lovestone group organized independently for a while, but dissolved into bourgeois society when they threw their weight behind supporting the US in WW2. 
The Fosterites became the official leaders of the CP, at this point a manufactured leadership in a manufactured party. 

Despite all the flaws and failures of the Communist Party in the US, it was for a long time the source of the flame of revolution. Out of the degeneration of the CP came the renewed forces to keep this flame alive.

# 6: The Break with the ComIntern
The German left didn't even put up a fight to prevent Hitler and the Nazis from introducing [[fascism]] to Germany. It would have been better for them to fight and lose, since this could later inspire a new movement. Giving up isn't inspiring to anybody. 

The complete bureaucratization of the Communist Party caused the Socialist Party to gain a surge of members. The Trotskyists began to orient away from the CP towards this new path to the masses. 

A layer of formerly Stalinist intellectuals began to break with that tradition, signalling the start of a mass movement of the workers away from [[Stalinism]]. The Trotskyists oriented aggresively towards this newly radicalizing layer, trying to form as wide a front as possible.
