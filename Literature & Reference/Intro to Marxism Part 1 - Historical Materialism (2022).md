> This video, made by Tex Talks, gives an introduction to [[historical materialism]] from a scientific and mathematical perspective.

# Stability
Tex argues that [[Systems tend towards stability]] (05:28). 

# Social labor and adaptation
- Humans vs animals
	- Human labor is social due to our biology
	- Mentions [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s idea of [[mutual aid]]. 
	- We can only look at *collective* stability when discussing human society
	- Comparison with termites
		- They also have a social conception of labor
		- More termite biomass on Earth than humans
		- What makes us different?
			- Termites are born into their roles biologically, humans have more agency (reproductive labor is only exception)
