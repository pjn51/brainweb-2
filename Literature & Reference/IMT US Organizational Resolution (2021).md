# 1. American Bolshevism in the 2020s: the road to revolution
The CC discusses the objective conditions facing the forces of [[Marxism]] in the [[USA]]. They say we have the most promising epoch ever ahead of us today, and there have never been so many opportunities for our ideas to take hold (3).

The CC argues that the decline of living standards, and the oppression faced by Americans at the hands of the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[state]] have created fuel for a revolutionary flame under the surface (4-5).

The CC says that our current epoch should be compared with the events in [[Russia]] when the forces of Marxism exploded from a tiny group of dedicated revolutionaries to a truly mass force. Supporting this claim, the CC cites some statistics: 70 million youth recognize that [[capitalism]] works against them, 39 million have a favorable view of Marxism, and 26 million believe that private property should be abolished. The CC concludes from this that there are many tens of thousands who would eagerly engage in organizing in the future (6-9).

The CC draws our attention to the needs that our current generation must fill. They say that previous generations kept the spark of Marxism alive, and it is our job to transform that spark into a wildfire. They call upon us to embrace the legacy of the [[Bolsheviks]] - their iron will, determination, and collective sacrifice. They say that the purpose of this organizational resolution is to clarify the nature of the opportunities we have, and the tasks that we should pursue (10-12).

# 13. A balance sheet of our present forces
The CC turns to the history of the US section of the IMT. We began as a single [[cadre]] living in North Dakota in 1998. We now have active comrades in 70 cities, nearby to over half of the US population. It took 15 years of grinding to get the first 100, and then 5 years to turn 100 into 200. During that period, there was a lot of turnover and the organization became more professional. The organization established a center in NYC, a bookstore, and doubled the full-time staff due to collective sacrifice (14-15). 

The CC continues recounting history. A cohesive national leadership was forming that was capable of organizing the work of newly forming [[cadre]] in many cities. These teams of cadre helped move the organization from 200 to 300 comrades in 11 months - when the goal was to do that in 18 months. Today, we are rapidly approaching 400, with 500 right around the corner if we stay professional and dedicated. We now have three dozen functioning branches and a few cities with more than one branch (16). 

The CC explains that half our membership is located in the "strongholds" of NYC, Boston, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Philly, St. Louis, NJ, and the Bay Area. Beyond that, SR now has ten other cities with medium-sized branches of 7-13 comrades and several dozen cities with embryonic groups. We are becoming a point of reference for a growing layer of advanced workers and youth (17-18).

However, the CC says we shouldn't lose sight of proportion. In most cities, we are recruiting the ones and twos. 20% of comrades are at-large or part of embryonic groups. If all our comrades became part of branches containing 5-7 members, that would mean the establishment of 40 new branches and the recruitment of 200-300 more comrades. Because of this, we are still in the early stages of building a Marxist tendency. However, we have a lot going for us, since we've established best practices for contact management and branch building (19-21).

The CC discusses online recruitment. In 2019, the National Center recieved fewer than 12 messages per month. Now, there are *several dozen messages per week.* From 2019 to 2020, recruitment rate rose from 6 to 16 comrades per month! Because of this, we can suspect that every city that has a modest foothold today may have multiple branches in the not-so-distant future. Our growth is accelerated due to the vaccum on the left in American politics (22-24).

Turning to the [[June 2020 uprising]], the CC reflects on what this indicated. The nearly perfect reflection of the ethnic makeup between the population and the protests indicated that the youth had a strong tendency towards racial solidarity. The CC argues that we should pay close attention to our own demographics, and make a conscious effort to recruit more women and people of color, without tokenizing. Because of the strong current of radicalization found in the Black youth, we must not allow ourselves to become cut off from the most opporessed layers of the working class (25-26). 

The CC has some ideas on how we should approach this. We should keep the segregation of neighborhoods and public spaces in mind. Centuries of racism have built up deep distrust between ethnic groups, as has the vulture-like attitude that some [[sectarianism|sects]] have when it comes to the Black struggle. Above all else, the CC says that this is a political question that will be solved on the basis of educating our cadres about the questions of oppression. We must convince the oppressed that genuine Marxism is the solution, and also educate our own cadres on the role of oppression in the [[USA]]. Furthermore, we must train our comrades to communicate our ideas in an empathetic way to those whose backgrounds are different from our own (27-28).

# 29. What are cadres and how are they formed?
The CC references [[dialectics]] to explain our approach to development. We grow and consolidate the gains of the present period, while preparing ourselves for the future period. What we do today enables us to make use of the opportunities tomorrow. We have established cadres and structures that can support an organization of a few hundred, and the new task is to create a skeleton capable of supporting a few thousand. This depends on continuing to strengthen and expand the core base of cadres. The key to sustainable growth is maintaining the ideal balance of quantitative and qualitative development (30-31).

The CC explains the factors that may lead to a successful revolution, when one breaks out. The presence of a well-organized and disciplined current within the movement, that is able to systematically put forward a revolutionary program is an important factor. The current IMT program provides this framework, but the process of the masses gathering around our program is not automatic. [[Lenin]] provides us with a blueprint of how to assemble a network of cadres connected to the working class in advance of revolutionary events. This method centers around training cadres, which is a painstaking process of ideological training and development that takes years (32-34). 

The CC recalls the history of Bolshevism to underline the importance of this process. It took decades of preperatory work in order to prepare the field for the events of October 1917. Through the patient work of distributing literature, organizing study circles, and debating ideas, the Marxists prepared themselves to take power. Importantly, this work also included intervention in the movement of the working class. Their success can be measured in the fact that in eight months, the ranks of the Bolsheviks exploded from 8,000 to over 250,000. For every formal member, there were many thousands of workers who were drawn to the Bolshevik program for socialism (35-36).

The CC highlights the importance of the cadres in this growth. They allowed for the scaling of organizational structure. In between wars, the officers study warfare and organization, so that when the time comes, the military can recruit and train millions very quickly. In our case, we study the class struggle and revolutionary activity so that we can gather the workers to our program in times of crisis (37-38).

Because of this historical evidence, the CC argues, we should focus on training our own cadres in this period. In line with this, they are updating the guidelines for building branches and setting up organizational structures. The essential function of this branch should be to serve as a training ground, educating comrades in Marxist theory and arming them with the skills needed to transmit these ideas to others. Branches must focus, in addition to education, on recruiting new contacts to the organization. They should do this through regular interventions, paper sales, and tabling (39-42).

# 43. What will it mean to establish Marxism as a genuine tendency?
The CC argues that Lenin taught that revolutionaries must win the support of the [[vanguard]] of the [[proletariat]]. They assert that the way to do this is found in [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]], namely to "link up, maintain the closest contact, and - if you wish - merge, in certain measure, with the broadest mass of the working people." The CC draws a lesson from this: we must increase numerically, yes, but we must also sink deep roots into the advanced layer of the working class, in whatever [[unions]], workplaces, and organizations they are found in. 

The authors state that the assemblage of a cadre network is only the first step, and after that we must set those cadres in motion as a transmission belt of the ideas of Marxism into the workers' movement. They want to form a political backbone for the movement. 

In order to turn the current of Marxism from an atomized, scattered force into an organized, disciplined, and recognized political unit, the CC urges us to train a network of cadres who are tempered by theory and understand how to actually interface with the working class to provide clarity while the workers provide the fury. 

# 56. Platform work: a step towards sinking roots in the class
The CC explains that the Spanish section coined the idea of "platform work" to define longer periods of directed intervention in other movements, organizations, or fields of work. 

The CC explains that student work has been the single largest source of recruitment, but that there are many new fields that are opening to us that may become nearly as important. 

# 66. DSA as a platform
The CC says that working within DSA has interesting differences from student work. For one, they explain, we don't control the agenda of our interventions or their context, and we also may face hostility from the leadership in some areas. 

However, the CC argues that such difficulties are inevitable as we become more visible in the labor movement. They clarify that we must consider bandwidth of comrades, and make sure that we get out more than we put in in terms of recruitment and valuable experience. 

# 73. Our post-pandemic tradition
The CC notes that we must "envision and anticipate our future development without losing sight of our present tasks." They reflect that during the Zoom era, we have maintained professionalism and gained over 150 comrades, a 70% growth. 

The CC elaborates our new challenge - returning to in-person organizing. While noting that we are now operating on a higher level, they say that we have the opportunity to carry forward the energy that we have into a new phase of growth, professionalization, and consolidation, with local goals relative to quality and quantity of our forces. 

The CC elaborates that this will mean different things at different sizes in each area, but generally that we must teach a whole new layer of the organization healthy in-person habits and attitudes towards the work, and building leadership teams "at all levels of the organization."

# 82. Student work
The CC quotes [[Liebknecht]], who said that "he who has the youth, has the future." They say that student work is a great way to sink roots in the working class, and that every branch should target a college or high school for regular paper sales, as well as flyer and poster on campuses. 

The authors note that students come from a variety of backgrounds and levels of willingness to engage. They say that some students will only begin to play a role after graduation, while some will drop away when they graduate, but that overall we should use student work to raise the profile of our organization, gain access to meeting spaces, and engage with the movements that exist among the students. 

Finally, the CC underlines that without falling into "[[workerism]]," we should orient all students that we come into contact with towards the broader workers movement and the labor movement. 

# 90. Our work in the labor movement
The CC explains that [[unions]] today are weak and usually represent an older layer. However, they continue, the IMT now has a labor committee to connect already-unionized members and provide support to those considering intervention in union drives. 

The CC elaborates that comrades should consider getting jobs in unionized industries, or intervening in already-occuring unionization efforts, but that the IMT is not at a size where we should put effort towards starting unionization drives. 

The CC discusses various ways to orient to the workplace, including setting up workplace study groups or branches, but say that there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Also, they say that intervention in labor actions can be a great way to approach union work, and that we should follow the approach of the Twin Cities comrades in intervening in the Marathon Oil strike. 

# 97. The press
The CC applauds the theoretical level and professionalism of *Socialist Revolution,* and says that all branches should have a goal of at least 2 paper sales per month, as well as using the press during all interventions. 

# 103. Opportunities and pitfalls in the period ahead
The CC argues that the rapid rise in interest in socialism and communism demonstrates that the objective conditions for revolution are developing faster than the subjective conditions. They conclude that we must urgently try to keep up with the pace of events by building a genuine Marxist organization, without losing our sense of perspective. 

The authors cite the example of [[Militant]], where the leading comrades became "intoxicated with the idea of their influence on events."

> As a general rule, we must identify each and every opportunity and seize it with both hands. However, in the coming period, we can expect to be confronted with many more opportunities than we can effectively seize. Given the quality and dedication of our cadres, there will be pressure on our comrades and the organization as a whole to take advantage of them. It would be criminal to turn away from the best opportunities, but it would likewise be a disaster to accept everything in a light-minded way, or to succumb to the pressures of substitutionalism or mindless activism.

# 110. Build the IMT!
The CC cites the method of Lenin, extreme flexibility in tactics and implacability towards questions of principle and theory. They say that we must understand there will not be a linear development of the organization, and that there will be many hard battles in the future. 

> Though we are still at the very beginning of a long and circuitous road, we are no longer at the beginning of the beginning. It is no exaggeration to say that, by the end of the decade, if we work correctly and do not make too many mistakes, the IMT stands to be the largest and most influential organization on the American left. But to achieve this, we must have a sense of urgency—it all depends on us, on what we do, and when we do it.
