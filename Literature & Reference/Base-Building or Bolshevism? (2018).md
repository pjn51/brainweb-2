> This is an article written by Antonio Balmer for the [[IMT]]'s publication, Socialist Revolution.

Balmer describes the preparatory periods that precede revolutions as a time of clarification of ideas, and the shaking off of the previous period's inertia of stability and passivity. He says that in such a period, there is a feeling that society is at an impasse while the events of history accelerate. He says that this pushes broader layers of people into political activity.

Balmer ties this analysis to the current day, saying that we're seeing a massive increase in the number and membership of socialist groups around the [[USA]]. He then asks how we can span the still-immense gap between this small vanguard and the 250 million strong working class. 

## 'Base-Building' and 'Dual Power'
Looking towards the [[DSA]], the author outlines the idea of "[[mutual aid|base building]]." He says that this is usually presented as a revolutionary strategy, or as a way of 'building working class power.' 

Balmer goes on to claim that [[Marx]] fought against attempts to divert the class struggle into...

>...doctrinaire experiments, exchange banks and workers' associations, hence into a movement in which it renounces the revolutionizing of the old world by means of the latter's own great, combined resources, and seeks, rather, to achieve its salvation behind societyâ€™s back, in private fashion, within its limited conditions of existence, and hence necessarily suffers shipwreck.
>\- Marx

Balmer outlines what he sees as an attempt by various activist groups to define and expand on the idea of base building. He points to a description of the 'basic tasks' of base building by a member of the Philadelphia DSA, in which the DSA member focuses on door knocking, forming block parties, setting up cooperatives, and other tactics. 

Balmer also brings the term "[[dual power]]" into the discussion. He says that the Marxist definition refers to a part of the pre-revolutionary situation, where the authority of the bourgeois [[state]] is teetering and competing with the newborn [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]. 

Balmer says that some on the left have started to refer to base building by the name of dual power, including a representative of Seattle Communists, who he quotes. 

Balmer points out that this novel-seeming trend actually has a long history that we can learn from. 

## "Going to the People"
Balmer gives us a historical overview of [[Narodniks]] and their movement. He calls attention to the 'educators' within the Narodniks, and compares their goal of building revolutionary [[class consciousness]] among the peasantry via "small deeds" with the tactics of the base builders today. 

However, Balmer notes that this tactic failed since the [[peasantry]] really just wanted property of their own and weren't open to revolutionary ideas. He says that the result of this was a shift towards [[terrorism]], which ended up destroying the Narodniks and their organization.

> Notably, this comparison fails to account for the class differences between the proletariat and the peasantry. A counter-argument could be made that "small deeds" among the workers will be more effective than they were among the peasantry. Of course, this can be countered by examining where revolutionary consciousness comes from. This consciousness comes from the experiences that the masses recieve under *capitalism,* not due to their interactions with activists. The idea that we need to put revolutionary ideas into the heads of the worker is [[idealism]], plain and simple. 

Balmer tells us that it was in the aftermath of these events that the Russian movement shifted towards an approach based on the [[proletariat]] instead of the peasantry, and on a tactic of building a proletarian leadership.

## From Base-Building to Cadre-Training
Balmer says that the Narodnik veterans didn't come around easily to the idea of a [[cadre]] organization. However, the author says that it was the burnout and failure of activists to achieve anything through "small deeds" that turned the tide. Balmer says that this sort of burnout will be familiar to anyone conducting base building today. 

The author describes the next phase of the Russian movement - [[Economism]]. He says that these leftists viewed the role of socialists as serving the workers, not leading them. Balmer says that the Economists just wanted to focus on economic issues, and stay away from political issues, which they didn't think the workers could understand. 

Balmer goes on to give a sketch of the later events, leading up to [[Lenin]] writing [[What is to be Done (1902)]].

## What is to be Done in 2018?
Balmer gives an overview of the events between 1902 and 1917, saying that the previous period of painstaking study and consolidation paid off when [[Bolsheviks]] were able to lead the Russian workers to victory. 

Balmer ties this history into the events of today, where he says that our task is generally the same - to create a cadre organization capable of winning the confidence of the workers and riding a wave of discontent into power. 

> [!Criticism]
> This article was pretty good, but never touched on the class question of the "small deeds" of the Narodniks. Additionally, I think that the article could have gone more in depth on the question of where revolutionary consciousness comes from. Many base builders seem to think that it is important that the socialists conduct agitation among the masses to turn them against capitalism. In my view, it is more important to focus on propagandizing to the very few who are open to revolutionary ideas, and rely on capitalism to poison the majority of the workers against it. By focusing on agitation too early, the vanguard gets somewhat wider, but severly lacks in depth.
