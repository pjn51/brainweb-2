This work of philosophy, written by [[Epitctetus]], is a foundational text of [[Stoicism]]. 

## One
Epictetus says that there are things within our power, and things outside our power. According to him, we should only seek to desire things within our power, and not things that we cannot control. 

If we do this, he says we will be able to achieve all that we desire, and live a good life.

## Two
When we fail to attain what we desire, we are hurt. When we fail to avoid what we are averse to, we are also hurt. Therefore, we should seek only that which is attainable, and be averse to only that which is avoidable. If we do this, we will never be hurt.

## Three
We should always remember that the things that bring us joy are impermanent, that they will dissapear, and that their loss will be bearable to us.

## Four
When setting a goal, also set the goal of keeping your will in accordance with nature. This secondary goal is far more important than the immediate one.

## Five
Our suffering is caused not by exterior events, but by our own interior perceptions and attitudes. Don't attribute pain to external things. 

> It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.
