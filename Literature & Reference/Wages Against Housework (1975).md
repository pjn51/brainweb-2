# Review
This book, or pamphlet really, isn't that great. [[Federici]] seems to be very caught up in bourgeois [[feminism]] and [[identity politics]], and even draws the conclusion that the *only* revolutionary position is that we should advocate for "wages for housework," rather than trying to involve women and other gender-oppressed people in any sort of collective liberation. 

---
Federici makes the point that it isn't the literal wages that are the end goal, it's the process of radicalization and the building of solidarity which would have to happen for this campaign to occur, and for the demand to be met. 

Federici claims that not only is this demand a revolutionary one, it is "the only revolutionary perspectie from a feminist viewpoint and ultimately for the entire working class." This seems very dubious. 

## 'A labour of love'
Federici admits that male workers are also exploited, but says that the difference between housewives and workers is that the wage workers are paid admits that the worker is a worker. Federici thinks that it is this admission which allows the worker to organize around the wage and struggle for improvements. 

> [!Criticism]
> This is a totally [[idealism|idealist]] notion. It is not the words that we use to describe the working class that allows it to struggle for improvements. Struggle is something borne of the real world, not the discourse that we have about the world. 

Federici contrasts wage [[labor]] and housework in another idealistic way. She says that while workers can change jobs and don't view their labor as their identity, women are made to feel that housework is essential to their identity. 

> [!Criticism]
> More blatant idealism! Also, how can she claim that workers aren't made to feel that labor is their identity? That's simply false. 
> 
> Identity exists downstream of the economics of society. Therefore, to argue about identities is first of all totally useless, and about as effective as trying to stop a river by standing in it and waving your arms. Second of all, the constraints of our relationships to production apply to male workers as well, who are forced to sell themselves to the capitalists for a wage. 

I think Federici is generally correct when it comes to describing the social position of women. She emphasizes that the role of the housewife is to perform the work of social reproduction that capitalism requires. Federici recongnizes that domestic abuse exists because the male worker is abused, and comes home to abuse his wife. 

> [!Criticism]
> Interestingly, Federici's solution to this doesn't seem to involve the male worker at all, but just to create solidarity between women, and allow for them to have greater economic independence through a wage. 
> 
> 
> Again, Federici seems to be totally preoccupied with the role of culture and identity as part of the process of oppression, but seems to be paralyzed when it comes to addressing capitalism, which she admits is the source of all the oppression. She constrains herself to addressing the problem at the leaf, instead of at the stem. 
## The revolutionary perspective
Federici sees revolutionary potential in the struggle for wages, because she believes that it will directly challenge the social role that women are confined to. However, she admits that the struggle here isn't to break out of capitalist relations, but merely to "attacks capital and forces it to restructure social relations in terms more favorable to us and consequently *more favorable to the unity of the class.*" 

> [!Criticism]
> I fail to see this point. 
> 
> 
> When we consider Marxist economics, we know that the wage a worker recieves covers the cost of reproduction of that worker and his or her family. Therefore, the struggle for wages by housewives is not a struggle to gain new [[currency|money]], but a redivision of money between the husband and wife. Therefore, how does this lead to increased class unity? How does this lead to revolutionary change at all?
> 
> The real benefit of this struggle seems to be raising awareness of the fact that women are oppressed. This shows the true extent of the power of this kind of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]], idealist activism. The fact is that in the US, the oppression of women is a well known phenomenon. This awareness hasn't moved us one inch towards womens' liberation.

> Additionally, nowhere in this article is it made clear *who* will pay these wages. Will the husband's employer pay? And reduce the husband's wage accordingly? Will the state pay? And raise taxes on the working class accordingly?

## The struggle for social services
> [!Criticism]
> Federici ironically states "...we will never achieve any real change unless we attack our female role at its roots." I agree! Let's attack capitalism, the force that enables and requires the oppression of women! Federici has a different idea. In her mind, if "they" (and this "they" is never defined) stand up and proclaim that womens' work is work, then women will unite in a revolutionary force to topple class society. 
> 
> Federici pays little attention to the demand which is actually more revolutionary, that of collective services that would replace the housework. Federici scrapes the surface of this question by stating that it's one thing to have collective daycares and whatnot, and another to allow the state to indoctrinate one's children. The obvious next step in this demand is to demand community control of these institutions, which would then actually unite the community in management and operation of them. Instead, Federici turns away from any communal solution to the problem of womens' oppression. 
## The struggle against housework
> Only when men see our work as work-our love as work-and most important our determination to refuse both, will they change their attitude towards us.

> [!Criticism]
> Federici thinks that having wages for housework won't cause husbands to demand more from wives, because she says that husbands are demanding because they believe that women enjoy doing housework, and that waged housework demonstrates that this is false. Ring the idealism bell once again, folks. 
> 
> 
> The view from a standpoint of [[materialism]] states that women are forced to do this housework because somebody has to do it, and the ruling class found it convinent to force women to do it. Women won't have their situation change just because people begin to think differently about housework! Would capitalism change if all the CEOs started to *think differently* about labor?! Would [[imperialism]] vanish if the soldiers and oil companies began to *think differently* about Iraq?!
> 
> Fundamentally, this article is garbage. 'Women' as such are not a class in society. They only have a shared [[consciousness]] insofar as working women do, as [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] women do, and as [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] women do. To attempt to wage revolution through uniting 'women' as such, we open ourselves to being totally outmanuvered by the capitalist class, who can easily split such coalitions by accepting the demands of the upper crust, and brutally oppressing the rest. We've seen this happen again and again, with the [[feminism|feminist]] movement, and with [[the black power movement]].
> 
> At it's core, this article represents the outlook of academics in the feminist movement of the 1970s. Feeling totally betrayed by the working class as a revolutionary force, they turn elsewhere in search of a vehicle that could change the world. In order to find such a vehicle where none really existed, they were forced to invent alternative coalitions that they could use.

## My response to this article
I think Federici makes good points about the oppression of women, but doesn't really provide a way forward. The idea that wages for housework is a revolutionary, unifying demand doesn't really make sense to me. It seems like it would be hard to really create solidarity between housewives the same way that class solidarity between workers can be achieved. 

Of course, any genuine workers movement would also be a movement for the liberation of women (and all oppressed groups for that matter), but we should recognize that the oppression of women isn't an end in itself, it is a means to the divison of the working class, and the continuation of capitalism. Therefore, in order to liberate women, and to end exploitation and oppression generally, we should proceed on the shortest route to the overthrow of the ruling class. 

Therefore, we must ask ourselves if the organization of housewives is the shortest way to this end. And it is not. We can raise the consciousness of the working class generally through struggle, since capitalism organizes the class into units that can work in solidarity through strikes and union negotiations. There is no such welding together of housewives, who by their relationship to production work alone and are isolated from one another, and society in general. 

I would say that the socialization of housework, which Federici talks about only briefly, is the more revolutionary approach, since it would create a more robust network of women that could work together and increase their consciousness. The best outcome would be to increase their consciousness both as women and as workers. 

We've seen the failure of the feminist movement to do this for precisely the reason that gender oppression is maintained not for its own purposes, but for the purposes of stabilizing capitalism and decreasing the solidarity of the working class. The liberal feminist movement failed because enough women were allowed to pass through the glass ceiling that it removed a chunk of support from the movement. The ruling class decreased the intensity of gender-based oppression, and simply increased the oppression on the basis of other factors. This is the way that they would respond to all sorts of identity-politics struggles such as the battle against racism. 

Fundamentally, the only thing the ruling class cannot squirm its way out of is class oppression. There is simply no way capitalism can operate if it removed class as an axis of oppression, while capitalism can continue to operate while decreasing gender or racial oppression, although this must come at a price to some other distrubution of oppression.
