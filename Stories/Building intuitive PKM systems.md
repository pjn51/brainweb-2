# Questions as natural knowledge organizers

---
# Premise
I want to explain the current system that I'm using for PKM, since I think the "question and idea" format that I've developed is pretty intuitive and hasn't been talked about enough. I want this to be a reddit post. 

# Thesis
By organizing our knowledge around questions and ideas, we can build scalable, flexible, intuitive personal knowledge management systems. 

# Outline
- Questions of PKM
- The basics of the QI format
	- Questions
	- Ideas
- Advantages
	- [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]
	- [[Organize information for retrieval]]
- Implementation

I think that the Zettelkasten method and the ideas in *How to Take Smart Notes* are really useful, but they don't discuss ways to organize notes beyond a simple index. By organizing our knowledge around questions and ideas, we can build scalable, flexible, intuitive personal knowledge management systems. 

As I began to build my own network of notes according to a more-or-less Zettelkasten approach, I soon ran into a dilemma. It was becoming increasingly difficult to make sure that I was making use of every relevant idea in the network. At first, I was able to just look through the folder where I keep all of my notes and see which ones might be relevant, but this has obvious limitations when the number of notes begins to climb. 

This presents us with the appearance of a binary choice: either categorize the notes in order to speed up the work of connecting a new note with relevant ones, or keep the notes in one big pile. Both of these approaches seem bad to me. A static categorization of notes would trap me into the system that I was trying to escape in the first place by allowing notes to develop connections organically. On the other hand, what's the point of having all these notes if I'm not reliably connecting relevant notes together?

I realized that there was a third path forward when I started thinking about the way in which I retrieve information. Usually, I start with a question that I'm trying to answer, and then I look for information pertinent to that question. This naturally led to a new method of organization around those questions. I found that when I did this by generating question notes, it was a natural and intuitive process. 

As I think of an interesting question, I'll create a note for it. Then, as I develop ideas that are relevant to the question, I'll link them to the question. The question note becomes a meeting place for different ideas, and that naturally builds a conversation between these ideas. Of course, having one question is going to inevitably lead to more specific questions, which further expands the network of questions. 

Eventually, the structure begins to look much like a tree: questions branch off from each other, while ideas attach to one or more questions in network that is simultaneously organic and unrestricted, yet easily searchable and most importantly - useful.
