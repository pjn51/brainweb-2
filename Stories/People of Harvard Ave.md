# People of Harvard Ave.
As a way to express myself and focus more on people around me, I want to take some time to write about the people who I see from my window. There are certainly a lot of them, and there are some interesting characters.

Today is rainy, making those on the street more rare. However, many people have no choice but to go somewhere, often walking their dog. Being in Seattle means that you can't afford to wait for the next sunny day. 

A man is walking his German Shepherd in the rain. The dog is protected by a cute yellow raincoat, while the man's shoes are discolored, one more than the other. The man is hunched over, trying to get this daily chore over with so that he can return home. The dog looks more put-together than the man, and is certainly enjoying the time in the rain more. 

The windows across the street stare back at me, mostly blank but with hints of life here and there. A lamp in one window, a cat tree in another. Hundreds of lives, with many apparently indifferent to natural light, preferring their blinds permanently closed. From down here in my east-facing apartment, that seems like a terrible waste. Suddenly, a set of blinds raise on the second floor, replaced by a black void as somebody lets in whatever light they can find on a day like today.

A street like this is like a sleeping giant. Walking through it on the way to a bar or resturant, you wouldn't see the life that it hides. But when something eventful happens, like an ambulance, fire truck, or protest march, you can see the neighbors spring to their windows and balconies, eager to keep up on local events. 

A woman with a dog walks by, swinging a small white object in her hand - so fast that I frankly can't tell what it is. A hat? A small bag? She has no hood, her hair drenched by the rain. She's also wearing birkenstocks and socks in this weather. Does her speed reflect her miscalculation of how much it was actually raining? No matter what cause, this woman is on a mission. 

A man with a rare umbrella strolls past. Not too fast, not too slow. An unused carabiner dangles from his hip, its function unknown. Six soggy paper bags sit in a doorway across the street. 

Two men walk together with their small pug, cloaked in a beige coat. The dog pees in a bush, and his owner whisks up the dog and puts him under his arm like a package. They walk away, chatting. Was the dog tired? They didn't seem to be slowing down or panting. Who knows? Later, I see them return with the dog still aloft. 

In the living room, I hear the silence replaced by Eylen's voice as she presents her UX designs to a room full of pixels.

A middle-aged man with a receding hairline strolls by, wearing a bright red bow on his forehead. He walks erratically down the sidewalk. Where could a person like that be headed?

At Rapport, there are various people enjoying the space and working.

I see a classic character - the person who wears the same clothes everyday and stands in the same ankles-crossed pose as he smokes his cigarette. But wait, today he emerges in a new jacket! Instead of his brown courdoroy standard, he now has a colorful flannel. 

I spy four young men obviously returning from a coffee-and-donuts run, with their leader carrying a blue leftovers box. They head into the apartment complex across the street. 

One thing I love about living in the city is the density of people here. The stories that I see on this street are repeated on every block of this neighborhood, and throughout the entire city. Within 2 miles of me, there are more than 100 thousand people right now.
