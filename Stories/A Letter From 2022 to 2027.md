# A Letter from 2022 to 2027
---
Hey, I don't know if I'm still going to be using Obsidian in five years, but here goes nothing. Hopefully this message will somehow reach you. I'm going to email it to you too. For me, today is May 20, 2022. For you, it's May 20, 2027! That means you're almost 30 years old. I have a few questions for you, some things that I wish I knew right now. 

Right now, I'm preparing for my final interview for a data analyst position at Indeed. Did I get that job? What are you doing for work? How is your career? Do you have enough time for other things in the day?

You knew I was going to ask about something political, so here it goes: are you still active in the IMT? If so, how is the Seattle branch? Right now, we're just about to reach our 10th local member. If not, that's even more interesting! What made you leave? I hope you're still politically active in one organization or another. Are you?

While I'm still on the political, how is the world doing? Probably bad! What's the worst thing going on? I hope you're relatively insulated from it, and I feel pretty confident in our prospects. 

How is Eylen? I assume you're still together, and you're honestly married at this point. But a lot can change in five years. Whatever's going on, I want to know about it. And of course, I want to check in on Mimi. I'm praying that she's still a happy and healthy kitten who still loves to jump into your lap whenever she has the chance. 

Where are you living? Right now, we're still living on Harvard Ave in Capitol Hill. We're trying to find a condo or townhouse to buy, but that seems unlikely from my point of view right now. Did we ever find that miracle property to get? If so, how is it owning instead of renting? Do you feel more trapped or liberated by that change?

I'm trying to get this letter to you in a few ways, because I'm not certain what aspects of your life will be the same as they are now. It seems like I can predict a year or two in advance, but five years seems different. It seems like being almost 30 would be a different phase of life, but now that I think of it, we know people now who are 28, and they're kind of doing the same things that we're doing now. So maybe things won't be so different. What's something that's basically the same as you were doing five years ago?
