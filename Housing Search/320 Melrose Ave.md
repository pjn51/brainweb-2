# 2020-21 proposed vs actual budget
- Good things
	- At the end of their budget for April 2020 - March 2021, they had $158k in their accounts, relative to an annual expenses of $161k predicted expenses for the next budget cycle. This means that they have ==98% of their predicted annual expenses in reserve.==
	- While 2020-21 was a really bad year for the HOA, ==they predicted their expenses well== and nothing was a surprise (they even came out slightly better than predicted). This makes their forecast of much lower costs more trustworthy. They forecast only $161k in expenses for 2021-22, down from $657k. 
- Neutral things
	- Their 2021-22 budget proposes ==raising HOA dues by 8%==, which is probably warranted given how bad 2020-21 was for their balances.
	- They predicted $10k in repairs and maintainance, actually spent $36k, and are predicting $10k again. ==Was it a one-time expense or are they ignoring reality?==
- Bad things
	- 2020-21 was a bad year for them. They had an income of $145k and expenses of $657k, for a ==deficit of $511k== due to roof repairs that cost the HOA around $420k. 
	- The HOA dues have doubled in the last four years.
- Conclusion
	- ==Best case scenario:== the HOA predicted this to be a trying year due to the roof repair, they were accurate as to their predictions, and they are no longer in much danger. 
	- ==Worst case scenario:== finances are very unpredictable year-to-year due to the age of the building, and HOA dues will be unpredictable, as well as special assesments. 

# Dealbreakers
- If the 2021-22 budget fails to accurately predict expenses
- If there doesn't seem to be a plan for increasing the reserve
- If the reserve is below 60% funded.
