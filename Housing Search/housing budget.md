# Initial calculations
See my [[personal finance]] and [[housing search]] notes.

If we want to maintain an ideal [[debt-to-income ratio]] of 28%, and assuming a takehome income of $52,000 for my job, and with [[Eylen]]'s takehome of $62,400, spending 28% of our income on a mortgage would amount to a ==max mortgage payment of $2,669.==

# Report from lender
The lender got back to us, and said that we qualify for a total purchase price of $850,000, with a down payment of $110,000 and up to $500 monthly HOA fees. 

This is a conventional, 30-year fixed rate mortgage. 

We could also go with 5% down, and get a total purchase price of $750,000 and HOA fees of up to $500 per month.

Our interest rate would be 3.125%, and Eylen saw that the average rate is around 3.377% today (2021-10-26).
