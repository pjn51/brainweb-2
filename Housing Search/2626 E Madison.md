See: [[housing search]]
LINK: []()

### Location
This is in Madison Valley, which has *some* walkable stores and options, but we would be riding the bus to get places. The stop is right outside. 

### Pros
Balcony. Parking spot. Access to public transit. In unit washer / dryer? I forget. 

### Cons
Too small. Building is somewhat decrepit, with moldy storage room.
