### Location
In Fremont. 30 min bus to Cal Anderson. Quiet, with a view of Lake Union (barely) and some nice trees. A 6 min walk to shops and the Lenin statue. 

### Pros
Triangle windows! Good lighting in living room. Spacious living room. In unit laundry. Quiet neighborhood. Parking spot. The HOA seems reasonable, meets monthly, and takes good minutes.

### Cons
Dark bedrooms. Carpet everywhere. The building had a rat problem. 2025 roof replacement incoming. Cannot remove living room carpet (HOA rules, we may be able to negotiate).

### Misc
4 out of 6 building units must be owner-occupied. 

$18,000 saved in HOA fund. They raise around $12,000 annually. 

# Questions to ask
- Can we install hardwood floor with sound dampening?
- Are owners allowed to VRBO / AirBnB?
