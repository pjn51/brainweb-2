# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is the third day of [[2022-02 Marxist Winter School]], but I've honestly lost interest. It's just too hard to pay attention with the online format, especially with the translation breaking up the flow of the leadoffs. I just can't focus. 

It feels like my routines are cracking a little bit. It's only been five days since Eylen went to LA, but it feels much longer than that.
