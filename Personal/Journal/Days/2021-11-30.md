# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for stability. My life is pretty stable now, and I think it's only going to be getting more and more secure as I get some more savings. 

I finally set up a day to drop off my extra monitor and keyboard at Atos, and [[Eylen]] wants me to go raid the storage closets lol. I don't know about that, but I will go get a badge so that I can get an Orca card. 

One of Eylen's old highschool friends was involved in a hit-and-run where she actually killed somebody due to her drunk driving on the night before Thanksgiving. It's really weird to see both sides of how fucked up the situation is, especially for Eylen who actually knew this person. Marina is her name, and she's probably gonna see at least 6 or 8 years in prison. 

I recieved my benefits card for my FSA today in the mail. I'm entitled to a flexible spending account, which allows me to use pre-tax income for healthcare-related costs. I think that I decided to put around $500 into the account annually or something. The thing is, they sent me two cards with different account numbers. I have no idea why they would do that, so I guess I have to call somebody. 

I guess I should take some notes on how [[A FSA allows you to use pre-tax income for healthcare expenses]].
