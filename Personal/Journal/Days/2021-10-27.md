# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to find a podiatrist and try and get some new insoles before my insurance changes to something more restrictive. I might have to get a PCP referral for that. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that [[Eylen]] got an offer! She's going to be paid $97,000 (!!!) as a full-time UX person for a livestreaming company. It's fully remote too! This month has been really good for us. 

# Benefits workflow
I need to choose a health plan on the Atos benefits website. In order to log in, I need my employee ID, and the password is the old style, with just a capital. In order to get the employee ID, I need to set up the AUTH app from the MyAtos website. In order to set up the AUTH app, I need to get a code from my Atos email.
