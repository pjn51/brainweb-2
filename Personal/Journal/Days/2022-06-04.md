# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We've been going back and forth with our latest offer for a townhome, and I don't want to jinx it but we're very close to closing the deal. The total price would be $775,000 and it was listed for $799,000 so we're getting a little below asking price, but it's still quite expensive. The upside is that the townhome is really nice, and it even has a little private backyard!

# They accepted our offer!!!!! Holy shit!!!!
I can't believe it. We're going to be moving to 211 26th Ave S in 21 days.
