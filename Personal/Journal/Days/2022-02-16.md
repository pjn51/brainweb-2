# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Yesterday was really nice. We had lunch at the Space Needle, which was very luxurious. It was a rotating resturant with a glass floor! We had some wine and hamburgers with fries. After that, Eylen surprised me by taking me to a hockey game, which was also really fun.

I had a short meeting with my manager, who let me know that my productivity is apparently good for a new grader, but that my disagreement rate is a little high. I don't think I'm really going to change anything, and maybe I'll just be a little more careful and see if there's still an issue in a few months. 

Yesterday I made a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkNFBAbaX9q__8d BN-vXSIQjKtPzGn2OYB-MlRUIE6U/edit#gid=0) that shows the amounts of notes created per day, as well as the number of total words in my vault. I can see that since the beginning of my [[Obsidian]] usage, my notes per day has increased, while my number of total words written per day has decreased over time. That might reflect my turn towards [[atomic notes]] instead of longer form ones for literature.
