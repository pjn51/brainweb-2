## Thoughts
Today I saw [[Jacob]] and we got lunch. After that, I helped [[Eylen]] go pick up a new desk she found for free on Facebook. We spent the evening setting it up. 

Fourth of July was weird. Eylen and I went to the house of a family friend, Vadim, who lives in Bonnie Lake in a nice house right on the shore. He is kind of full of himself and obviously is very proud of the fact that he has money now. The whole crowd there were the kinds of people that thought BLM was a terrorist group and that the vaccines were causing people to become dumb.
