# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today Syd came over to hang out with us. 

I was supposed to attend a Central Committee meeting, but I didn't go. I also forgot to send apologies, and Jake admonished me, implying that these sorts of errors reflected badly on my being asked to join the CC, and that I should take these meetings more seriously. I feel honored that me joining the CC is even on the table, but I don't think I could take the extra work on. I know that the CC meets a few times a year in New York City, and I don't know if that would work for me. But on the other hand, I feel like political work is my real passion in life, and I don't want to preclude myself from getting more involved. That's the real contradiction of my life (not to be overly dramatic) - family or party?
