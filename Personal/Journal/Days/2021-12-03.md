# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for the fact that my two meetings were postponed, allowing me to have a lot more free time today than I expected. Of course, I wasn't dreading these meetings, but this gives me more flexibility. 

I'm going to do my laundry today, and then I'm going to go pick up a copy of [[Russia - From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (1997)]] from Jacob. 

I reached out to Jordan, and he said there's a show tomorrow night that he and Rae are going to. I think I'll tag along and that will be fun. 

800-521-2227 // group no 276693 // this is for www.bcbstx/member.com so that I can see my benefits. 

I was thinking about how [[The Republican and Democratic Parties are codependent]]. 

I can't find any good online resources for creating a budget spreadsheet, so fuck it - [[What's the best way to organize a budget?]]
