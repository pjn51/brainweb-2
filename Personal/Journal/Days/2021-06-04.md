## Thoughts
Today I convinced Eylen to give me an oreo for every full hour of work I do. I'm a very food motivated person so I expect this to be a success!

I finally figured out how to list the files created on each day in my daily note. I added it to the template so that I can see what I was thinking and writing about on each day. Should add to the value of looking back at all these notes. 

## Scrabble scores
Patrick: 98

Eylen: 124

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime 
```
