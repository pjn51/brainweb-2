# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for friends, family, and the fact that I feel on top of my habits and chores. I know this feeling doesn't stick around forever, but I'm hoping the new chore system will keep me more accountable. 

My top priority today is to get a bit of work done on the stash project, and to stay grounded.
