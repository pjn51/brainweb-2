# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to go on a bike ride- 🚴. I want to ride to Fremont or Ballard or something. 

Today I'm grateful for cute Mimi who awakens me with love every day. 🐈

[[Eylen]] and I rode from our house along the shore of Lake Union, up to the locks and through Ballard and Fremont. We rode to UW and took the link back up to Cap Hill. That was really nice. It was a lot of work to get Eylen up and out of the house, but it was worth it and I'm glad she had some outdoors time.
