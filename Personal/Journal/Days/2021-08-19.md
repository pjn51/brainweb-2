# Thoughts
Today my mission is to get my various meetings and tasks done. Lots to do before we leave for a cabin in Cresent Bar tomorrow! I have 4 meetings today, and I have to drop off our keys at [[Jacob]]'s apartment, and I have to do laundry and pack for the trip.

Today I'm grateful for my friends who bring me along on fun trips even when I don't really help plan anything.
