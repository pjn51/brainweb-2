# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to get a [[COVID-19]] test (for our trip to Canada) and get through the rest of the disagreements from the training bucket. 

Today I'm grateful for [[Obsidian]]. This platform really makes learning fun, and I have no idea how I lived without it for so long. I really wish I could have made use of this during college.
