# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for the last day of the holiday break before I return to work tomorrow. Not that I'm really giving up much free time, haha. I feel happy to be going back because it adds structure to my day, and time to feel like I've really gotten something accomplished. 

My top priority today is to do something nice for myself, seeing as I met my goal for chores last week. I'm off to a rougher start this week, but I think I can make it up later in the week as I get back to work. The [[Chore chart project]] system allows for a lot of flexibility, which is one of the main advantages. 

Right now we're sitting in Caffe Vita and relaxing. This is my reward for doing all the chores last week. 

I really want to create a system that forces me to connect with more people. I want to make a spreadsheet of all my friendships that I want to cultivate, is that too weird? It seems weird, but I also feel like it would actually work for me and would get me in the habit of reaching out to people. I think I'm just going to do it, but I really hope nobody finds it lmao, it's just creepy to be keeping track of something that's supposed to be organic and natural like that.
