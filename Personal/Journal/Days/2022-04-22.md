# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is pretty busy. I have a call with [[Hayden]], and then we need to clean the house and prepare for Lydia coming over this afternoon. She and Logan are headed to South Dakota soon, so we're saying goodbye this weekend. 

# One-on-one with Hayden
- They went to the picket on Sunday, "didn't stay very long" (3 hrs!) 
- Sold three papers! 
- Qs about the reading
	- How can we keep electeds accountable to avoid the situation with the [[Mensheviks]] and the Provisional Government?
