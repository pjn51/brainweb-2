# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
A rainy Monday. It rained all night and made it kind of hard to sleep well actually. The blanket was also all fucked up which was not nice. Somebody is supposedly coming to repair our fridge "during the first half of the day" but I suspect they will arrive at a totally random and unexpected time. After they do, we were going to head to Rapport and work there for a little bit. 

I had a dream that I was at the cabin of some relatives and they tried to molest me. 

Today the rain has turned our sub-par landscaping into a swamp, and the only people out on the street are those who have something to accomplish. I'll write about the [[People of Harvard Ave]]. 

[[How can I become more well rounded?]]
