# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Another day of decisions, decisions, decisions. I hate decisions! Too many wrong answers. We just have to figure out homeowners insurance, which I think we can do by the end of today. That's the last real decision we have to make, assuming everything goes according to plan with our loan application. 

# OoO with Josh
- He reached out to Poliana about getting a subscription
- He wants to do a leadoff soon
- Preparing for his entrance to UW
- His trip to Italy
	- Gone for 2.5 weeks

# Homeowners insurance
- We need to insure 80% of the rebuild cost of our home. This [site](https://www.homebuilderdigest.com/cost-guide/washington-cost-guides/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-house-in-seattle/) says that construction costs in seattle range from $350 to $500 per square foot. If we use $400, multiplied by the 1197 sq ft, we arrive at a rebuild cost of $478,800. 

# Calling Geico
- Can we bundle auto?
	- They bundled it, we get a 5% auto discount if we go ahead with this
	- He recommends that we get close to the price tag in the coverage so that we satisfy the mortgage coverage requirements. 
	- $1149 annually. 
	- Need the loan officer's name and email
