# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for my health at the moment. I've been researching what insurance plans to get, and I'm very grateful that I'm doing okay right now. The costs for me just to maintain my health are so high, that I don't even want to think about how much it would cost if I were to enter another big flare or something. 

Dealing with the insurance system is the one thing that makes me really hate [[capitalism]] from my guts. I'm trapped in this system that just wants to bleed me dry and leave me dead when I can no longer provide a profit for these vultures. 

OMG! WYSIWYG just dropped for [[Obsidian]]!!! Very exciting. Notably, it doesn't seem like [[dataview]] is supported, but that's to be expected for a beta. 

I was thinking recently how I should avoid making my idea notes too static. The essence of this idea is that [[Idea notes must be scoped]]. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
