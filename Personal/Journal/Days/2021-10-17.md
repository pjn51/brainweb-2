# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to go see an apartment, and generally relax and get the house in order. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that [[Eylen]] is setting up all these apartment showings. We saw three yesterday, and we have one additional today. 

I've been thinking about how [[I have a tendency towards passivity]]. 

I should look into an [[adjustible rate mortgage]] over 7 or 15 years or something. Look into "fee-simple" townhouses. You just own it outright with no condo board or HOA or anything.
