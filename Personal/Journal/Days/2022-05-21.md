# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I have [[2022-05-21 branch]], and then we're headed to Elizabeth's house for a Mario Party. We haven't seen their house yet, so that should be interesting. I feel like they will have good interior design. 

I created a table of attendance at branch, and I can see that as of this meeting, Jacob only has a 44% attendance rate since the start of the year.
