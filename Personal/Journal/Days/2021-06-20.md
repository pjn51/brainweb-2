## Thoughts
Today is the first official day of summer! It's also Evan's birthday. We went to the Getty Center, and then drove on mulholland drive to Hollywood. The Getty center seemed to have some sort of curse of sleepiness, and we were basically slumped by this point.

In Hollywood, we walked the Walk of Fame and headed to Silver Lake to have some Thai food. The Walk of Fame was so trashy it was beyond belief. So many people were trying to take pictures with you or hang you flyers it was a bad trip. The wait at the Thai place was really long and we were so hungry by the time food came. But silver lake seemed cool, more of a hip area. 

After that, we watched the sunset at Griffith observatory. There were a lot of people there. 

Overall, this was a very sleepy day. I think it's impossible to do so much day after day without getting burnt out. And tomorrow we're spending the whole day at Six Flags and I hope I won't just be exhausted. I'm hoping to grab drinks with socialist Evan in the evening.
