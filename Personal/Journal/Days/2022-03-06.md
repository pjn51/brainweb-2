# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we went to a regional pole sports competition. It was really cool to watch the talented people perform routines. Those people are really fit. 

On Friday, Mikey called me while we were out and about. I told him I would call him back on Saturday, but I never did. Now it's Sunday night, and honestly I don't really want to call him. It's selfish, but it's not that interesting and feels like a chore to talk to him.
