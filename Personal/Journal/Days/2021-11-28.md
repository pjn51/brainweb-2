# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for another lazy day with nothing we have to do. We just lounged around and watched Lost like yesterday, although we somehow managed to muster the willpower to work out, and I cleaned the kitchen. So it wasn't a totally lazy day. 

Maybe this is our reaction to being thrown back in to the gloomy weather from sunny and warm Boulder - a total collapse of our ability to do anything. 

Today was the day that Bryce and I agreed to have the rough draft of my article, [[Lessons from the CHOP]], ready. However, I think I'm going to ask for an extension for a few days, even though it's basically done. I'll take a look at it and decide by the end of the day if I need more time for the draft.
