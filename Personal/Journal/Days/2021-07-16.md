## Thoughts
I actually made it to 20 job applications this week. That's so much more than I've been doing, but it's really how I should have been going about this process all along. This is my 12th week of the job search, meaning that I've now been looking for jobs as long as I was in the bootcamp. That's a sobering fact, but I'm confident that *eventually* I'll get a break here. 

not only the end user, but the *software developer.*

proficient understanding of design, feasability, the impact of design systems on designers and developers, and how to communicate between both of these parties.
