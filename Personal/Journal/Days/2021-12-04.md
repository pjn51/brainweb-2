# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for my comrades. We had an excellent meeting today, and then we went tabling in Columbia City, which seems like a really good area for us to go to. We had a lot more interest than Cap Hill, and it actually made me more interested in living in that area. The people were a lot more polite, and we got a higher percentage of interested people than Cap Hill for sure. Like a lot more. Even though it was 40 degrees and rainy. 

My contact Freeman came, and he seemed genuinely interested in getting involved. He even rode the train to come tabling with us in the cold. 

Tonight I'm going to a show with Rae, Jordan, Jeff, and Ari. It should be pretty fun, although it's really cold out and I've already stood in the cold for a few hours today at this point tabling.
