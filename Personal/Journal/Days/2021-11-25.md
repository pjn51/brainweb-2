# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for lots of things since it's Thanksgiving! We actually had our big dinner last night because Wyatt is going to be attending Heather's grandmother's dinner today. 

Things I'm grateful for:
- [[Eylen]]. She has been really sweet to me these past few months, and I feel like she really appreciates me. 
- My family. We are getting more and more comfortable with each other which is nice. We even had a nice afternoon with Wyatt.

I was thinking about intelligence, and how different societies value different skills and would probably think about intelligence differently from one another. In societies that value mathematics and those skills, of course we would think that being good at math and analytical thinking is deemed "intelligence" but in other societies characterized by other modes of production, those skills might not be valuable at all. On the other hand, what mode of production wouldn't require analytical skills? That seems like it would be valuable no matter what.
