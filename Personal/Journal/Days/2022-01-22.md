# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today was a pretty standard Saturday. I had branch in the morning (online) and then we did our laundry while waiting for Cinder to come down from Everett. We hung out with them for a bit, and then went to the U District to get some food. However, they forgot their phone at our place, and with it, their vaccination card. Therefore, we couldn't get the Korean food we wanted to, and had to go to Aladdin's where they don't check vax cards (lol). 

This was a day spent waiting. We waited for the laundry, and then we waited for Cinder to get here.
