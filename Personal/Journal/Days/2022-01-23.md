# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today I'm writing from Union Coffee, a nice cafe in the Central District. Today was a relatively chill day with not much activity. I heard that I actually won't be starting as a TA again at [[Metis]], and it's kind of annoying that they didn't give me more than 24 hours notice of this fact, but honestly I'm happy to be able to do Aikido twice a week now. I might even end up going three times a week in order to take advantage of the classes offered. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST

WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
