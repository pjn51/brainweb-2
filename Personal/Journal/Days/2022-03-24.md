# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We got back from our Portland trip today. It was really fun! The AirBnB was a large mansion in the Hoyt Arboretum, with a hot tub and sauna that had a view right into the forest. It was a blast to take ketamine and relax in the tub looking up at the misty forest canopy. We actually didn't see that much of Portland, but it was a great trip nonetheless. We went into town twice - once to Hawthorne where there were lots of thrift shops and good Cuban food, and another time to dinner and a karaoke room. I sang a lot in karaoke, and I realize that's a great way to come out of my shell a little bit. Celeste and I stole the show with our passionate renditions of Lana Del Ray songs lmao. I picked up [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1964)]], which is supposed to be a great read.
