# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today I *actually* need to set up some meetings with data engineers. I'm going to reach out to these people:

- [x] Janet Carson (at Echodyne) // reached out via Slack
- [ ] Jay Marshall Coskey (at Facebook)
- [ ] Jeremy Lehner (at Usermind)

I have my final discussion of the members' handbook with Freeman this evening, and I need to decide whether to propose him for membership at the next branch. He said that he was attending meetings of some other organization, so I need to be quite clear that if he wants to join our organization, it's his responsibility to attend our meetings and not let other group loyalties interfere with that. I should make it clear that he can still attend branch as a non-member if he wants to continue "shopping around." 

I need to finalize a reading group day and time for [[2022-02-12 branch]]
