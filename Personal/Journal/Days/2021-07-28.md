# Thoughts
Today is a bit busy. I have a phone call with a technical recruiter this morning. She is a friend of Brenda's and has agreed to look over my resume and maybe send my information along to others. After that, I have a [[2021-07-28 Code3 screen]], and then I have an infusion in the afternoon. 

The interview didn't go so great. I don't really have any marketing experience, so I'm not sure why they wanted to interview me for this role. I feel [[burnout]] coming back a little bit, which is not great. 

# Notes from conversation with recruiter Heather Schwartz
- best bet is larger companies
- slack user groups
- trying to connect with recruiters
	- she knows some
- send resume, she can share with 150+ recruiters
- include cloud envs in linkedin
- its a hot market
- sell myself on linkedin messages to recruiters and workers
