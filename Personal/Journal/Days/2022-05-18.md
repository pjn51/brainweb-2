# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I just happened to wake up early, just to remember that I have [[2022-05-18 w Zisman]] today at 8 am. Pretty good timing on my part. Actually, I don't have much to talk about with him, which is a good thing. 

I want to avoid having tunnel vision when it comes to my upcoming panel interview for the [[Listing - Indeed Technical Analyst]] role. I need to be ready to discuss situational questions, past projects, and general questions that they're going to ask me. 

I think I'm going to start writing stories about major life events, so that I can eventually aggregate them into an autobiography if I want to. Obsidian has allowed me to aggregate small ideas into big ones, and I don't see why it couldn't also serve this purpose.
