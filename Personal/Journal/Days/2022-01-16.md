# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Last night, all my books came in! Now I have physical copies of all the books I'm reading for my [[IMT]] meetings - [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]], [[Russia - From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (1997)]], and [[What is to be Done (1902)]].
