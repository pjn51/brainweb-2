# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I feel pretty much back to normal today. There's still a bit of gunk in my throat, and my skin is still sensitive, but my fever and aches are gone. Eylen's throat still hurts a lot though. 

The hiring manager for Indeed sent me a Hackerrank assessment! I'm going to try and complete that before our phone screen on Monday. It's either going to be [[Python]] or [[SQL]], so I'm brushing up on my SQL knowledge today and tomorrow. I really hate SQL - it's just not intuitive at all.
