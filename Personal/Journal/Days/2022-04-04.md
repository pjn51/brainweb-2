# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I'm meeting up with Hussein, the British comrade who's in town. He's asked me to bring along a few of our papers for him to take back home. I feel fine today, alleviating my worries that my headache yesterday was [[COVID-19]] related. 

Tonight we're seeing Lights, who Eylen was really into in highschool.
