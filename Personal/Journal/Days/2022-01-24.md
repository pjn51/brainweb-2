# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today would be the first day of resuming my TA duties, but it isn't. I actually feel good about that, but I just got my nice new webcam and I almost feel dissapointed that I won't be able to test it out! On the other hand, I don't enjoy being on video at all, no matter how nice my webcam is. It was just a lot of anticipation to get this set up, and now it's a let down to have it go unused. 

However, I do have some online meetings to use the webcam for. We're having a joint meeting with the Bellingham comrades this Friday, so that will be good, and then we're going to be having at least one and likely more online branches after that. The [[COVID-19]] numbers are dropping somewhat, or at least not continuing to rise exponentially, but we can't rush back too soon. 

I'm looking forward to Aikido today. I'll be going every Monday and Thursday from here on out. I'll probably buy a gi today as well, which is going to be fun. I hope it's comfortable!
