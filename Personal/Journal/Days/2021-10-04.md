# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to read up for my meeting with JCR this afternoon, and to work on my Gartner take home assignment. 

Today I'm grateful for my Atos job still. It will be interesting to see when the glow wears off, but it's still going strong. It's like a giant weight is lifted off my shoulders.
