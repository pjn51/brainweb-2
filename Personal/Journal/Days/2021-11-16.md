# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for having a stable existence. I love routine and having a standard daily schedule. 

We're signing our offer for [[600 21st Ave]]! We're almost certainly not going to get it, but there's a 5% chance in my opinion. The seller is expecting 2 to 3 offers already. 

Update: we didn't get the home, somebody put in an offer $40k above ours, which is depressing. I think we're going to have to save up a lot more money to afford something nice anywhere close to the areas we want to live.
