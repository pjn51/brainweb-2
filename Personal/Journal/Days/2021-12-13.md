# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for [[Obsidian]]. This software has basically made learning my favorite game. 

If I could only do one thing today, I would get some coding done. I've really fallen out of the habit and I don't want to let this new job cause my technical education to stagnate. 

I should remember that the [[stash-o-matic project]] is basically my ticket to a career after [[Atos]]. I need to do enough work on it to justify having "data scientist for over a year" on my resume when I look for another job. 

There's a new update to Obsidian that allows files to show backlinks at the bottom of the notes. This replaces the need for my custom [[dataview]] query, but it has one disadvantage. It will show all backlinks, not just the unmentioned ones like my query does. I think I'm still going to adopt this new option, because it makes it easier for me to rename notes, and it applies to all my notes retroactively. 

I ended up using `dataviewjs` to create a dashboard that groups idea notes by their tags. Pretty slick, and solved a longstanding issue with my vault organization.
