# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for friendly and foolish Mimi! We got her back from Marina's house this morning and she was happy to see us, although I think she would also be content living in Marina's apartment forever. She's just a go-with-the-flow type of cat. 

Today we just spent the whole day relaxing and watching Lost. It was nice to do nothing after a week of running all over the place at my parents' house.
