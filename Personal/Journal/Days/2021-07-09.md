## Thoughts
Today is Mom's birthday! She said there's over $1000 left in the 529. I nearly forgot that I have an optical appointment today! 

I created some quick stats about my job search. I've applied to 56 places, and I've had 2 interviews. That means my interview rate is 3.57%. I've been averaging 5.1 applications per week, which I really need to ramp up. I think I can easily get to 10 or 15 a week. 

## Today's notes
