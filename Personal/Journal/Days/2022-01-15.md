# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today was pretty fun. Eylen was feeling down in the morning, so we spontaneously decided to go to a trampoline center in Tukwilla! It was fun, but it was like 90% small children and then there was us. So that was a bit weird, but it was fun regardless. It was also a decent workout too which surprised me. We rarely do random things that we've never done before, so it was nice to break the pattern a little bit. 

We also went to Bahama Breeze, her former workplace, as well as Southcenter Mall, where she used to work at Pacsun. The day was basically a tour of Eylen's childhood and her early jobs. The food at Bahama Breeze was ok, and we saw that the mean bartender was *still* working the same job, many years later. Eylen wished that she could go back and tell her past self leaving the resturant for the last time that the next time she would be there, she would be at a totally different place in life.
