## Thoughts
Today after I finish my TA stuff, I have to do laundry and pack for LA. I also have [[2021-06-17 AC]] at 5pm. I think our friends are coming over to spend the night so that we can all go to the airport really early tomorrow. I'm excited for the trip but it's going to be *really* hot, like 95 every day that we're there. 

The TikTok of us heckling Bezos got more than 20,000 views, but it got taken down because of "bullying." It's floating around r/publicfreakout as well. It even got into some kind of [news site](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/jeff-bezos-tiktok-bullies/). Some people on Reddit are mad that [[Eylen]] made fun of Jeff's lazy eye, and others are making fun of us and saying that we probably love to buy things off Amazon. Reddit really is surprisingly right-wing sometimes. 

It would be around $60 for a Lyft that would take around 20 minutes. Or we could do the LINK and that would take more like 50 minutes.
