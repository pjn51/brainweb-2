# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for [[Eylen]]. I took some notes on what love really means, and I realized that I should try to get better at loving her. I'm often kind of emotionally distant, and I don't try to make her feel happy and loved that often. One example is my seeming inability to give good gifts. 

Today I'm going climbing with my friends to celebrate my birthday, which already feels like it's passed. Then we're going to get drinks somewhere in Capitol Hill. 

Yesterday I had a conversation with a Twitter mutual about the PMC. He sent me an interesting essay on their role, called [[The Middle Class Levithian (2020)]]. I took notes on it, and while it has serious flaws, it did change my perspective somewhat.
