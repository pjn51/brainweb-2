## Thoughts
Today I have branch --> [[2021-06-30 branch]] and tabling. I'm not really in the mood for tabling but I think it will still be good. I [[meditation|meditated]] today for the first time in a while. I feel really peaceful, which I guess I haven't been feeling lately. I kind of forgot how nice the post-meditation feeling of calm is. 

We went tabling today and *immediately* ran into some asshole who was convinced that socialism killed millions of people. He was dedicated to preventing us from interacting with anyone else, and yelled at people who approached us. It didn't prevent us from selling one paper, but we just decided to leave since he showed no sign of budging. 

Having branch in person at [[Jacob]]'s apartment was really great. It felt different to have a political discussion in real life instead of over Zoom. It felt easier to talk without notes I think. I think it will really re-energize me when it comes to political work. 

## Paper sales
1 Venmo for $4
