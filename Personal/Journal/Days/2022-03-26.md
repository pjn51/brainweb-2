# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Branch today was lowkey, with just me, Freeman, and Chris. We had a good discussion about [[Maoism]], and the smaller turnout allowed us to have a more focused effort to convince Freeman that Mao wasn't so great, and that the alliance with the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] was a mistake. 

As the branch has grown, we're starting to have more absences and less engagement on Slack, which I suppose is inevitable. I want to talk with Jake about that during our one-on-one. 

Today is a day of catching up on lots of things that happened in the 'aftermath' of the trip to Portland. Eylen's foot really hurts after we got back from our trip. Yesterday, she went to urgent care and now she's on antibiotics for a possible infection. She also has a bunch of what seem to be bug bites, and I have a few too. We heard from others on our Portland trip that they also have some bites, so we're suspicious of the AirBnB having an infestation! 

When we got back from our trip, we found that our building has replaced the laundry machines. Normally, this would be a welcome development, but in our case, this is going to prevent us from circumventing the payment to get free laundry with our maintainance key. Since it's all through an app now, there doesn't seem to be anything we can do. On the bright side, the machines are shiny and new, and are significantly faster than the old ones, and the app will alert you when your laundry's done!
