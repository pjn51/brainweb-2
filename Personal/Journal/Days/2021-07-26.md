# Thoughts
Today is the third day of the [[2021 IMT World Congress]]. I feel like I have to tear myself away from it to get my job search work done! This Congress has really invigorated me in spite of the contraction in the local work we've been doing. 

Today is the day that I get back to work for real. I gotta do 5 applications, and work a bit on the [[stash-o-matic project]] if I can. 

## One-on-one with JT
- My comments
	- Inspiration from congress
	- Josh
		- Seems dedicated
		- Meeting with Tom still
- Org vs political tasks
	- When org is solid, we can focus on political stuff
- BDC
	- Offers connection in a milieu of at-large comrades
	- We could meet in between anchoring BDC meetings
	- Considerations
		- Making sure the other comrades are in agreement with coming to the BDC
- Retain gains, make orderly retreat
- We want to avoid routinism

## One-on-one with TM
- My points
	- Lack of connection to the masses
	- Lack of foresight of the Euro [[bourgeoisie]]
	- Shows the foresight of the capitalists in the [[USA]] by easing off [[Germany]]. 
	- Situation is reversed today.
- Tom's points
	- Questioned what Trotsky meant
