# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to take the day to relax and recharge after my very political weekend. The strategic planning meeting was great! My leadoff went very well, with people laughing at my jokes and I think I inspired the group which was a good feeling. I'm really excited about the work now, and I honestly can't wait to start meeting more regularly. 

Today I'm grateful for having a calm home that I can come back to and feel very at ease. 

Someone from my [[health]] insurance called me, saying that he's my outreach coordinator or something --> (360) 637-4882

# Call with Chris Crane
He's going to be gone from September 28 until November, and then he'll be gone January as well. He's going to come up to meet with me on the 26th to check in before he leaves.
