## Events and thoughts
Today is Christine's high school graduation, so we're headed down there this afternoon. We got a new couch yesterday and the house is a total mess so cleaning's my main priority today. 

[[Eylen]] finally got a contact position! It's only for a month, but it's at AT&T, which is a big deal. Every missed opportunity has been because she doesn't have enough experience, and this changes that a lot. I think she will have a much easier time getting her foot in the door after she demonstrates that she can work on a real team and generate value. 

I spent some time setting up my weekly notes in [[Obsidian]] this morning. I want to keep track of the things that happen each week and compile them for the future. Also, I can keep track of how productive I was each week and try and keep myself accountable. 

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
