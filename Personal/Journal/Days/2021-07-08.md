## Thoughts
`ls -R *.md | wc -l` should be able to show me the total word count of my vault in the [[command line]], but it isn't working. I need to get to the working directory where [[Obsidian]] is found, and that's also a pain since I'm storing it in iCloud. Today has been a productive day, which is a relief after the 48-hour slump that I've been in. However, I really need to get groceries since there's nothing to eat for lunch. 

I also have [[2021-07-08 AC]] today.

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
