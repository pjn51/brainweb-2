# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
[[Eylen]] is home! I picked her up from the airport last night. It's nice to have her back. We're relaxing at Rapport and getting some work done. 

# Experimenting with DataviewJS
```dataviewjs
// some dummy dates to test with
var date = ['2022-02-25', '2022-02-26', '2022-02-27']

// map day numbers to day names
let names = {0:'Monday',
			 1:'Tuesday',
			 2:'Wednesday',
			 3:'Thursday',
			 4:'Friday',
			 5:'Saturday',
			 6:'Sunday'}

// loop through each date in the dummy list
for (let day in date) {
	dv.paragraph(date[day]);
	// conver to date type
	var d = new Date(date[day]);
	dv.paragraph(d.getDay())
	var i = d.getDay()
	dv.paragraph(names[i] + ':' + ' [[{date}]]'.format('{date}', date))
}

```

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
