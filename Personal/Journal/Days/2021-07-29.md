# Thoughts
I think there should be some additional value to job applications that I apply to using a connection. Maybe I should add a weight to those relative to cold applications. How about one connection app is worth two cold apps? I feel like the real value is more like 4x a cold application. I think adding such a weight would reduce my stress and allow me to focus more on actual progress in my job hunt rather than just using a shotgun approach, which hasn't been working for me at all. 

In order to keep track of where I have connections, I should make a [[career connections]] note.

I applied for a [[data engineering]] role at GitHub, and now I'm trying to brush up on as much data engineering concepts as possible in case I get an interview, which Jeff says is likely. We will see. 

I feel like I've finally stabilized after my bad week last week. Back in the rhythm.
