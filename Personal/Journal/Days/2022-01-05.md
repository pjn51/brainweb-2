# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
I just woke up and I really need to do my laundry. I've needed to do it for a little bit already and I just want to feel clean and have more options for clothes. The day after I do my laundry is always nice, because I can wear my favorite shirts, and I feel free. 

We've been staying up too late for the last few days, and it's made the mornings a real struggle. In the moment, it feels like a special treat to stay up later than we know we should, but we pay the price later when it feels like we've dropped 10 IQ points. 

Later today, I'm going on a walk with Jacob. I feel bad for not reaching out to him for so long, but I did so because of how he sometimes emotionally dumps on me when I see him. I feel like his therapist sometimes, and I just don't know what to say when he tells me about the same problems over and over. He just really needs a job lol.
