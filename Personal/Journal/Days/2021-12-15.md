# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for [[Eylen]] bringing some spontaneity into my life. She booked a [[screenprinting]] session for us this afternoon, and we're going to print some shirts with here Mimi design. 

I was tweaking the [[dataview]] in my [[thought cabinet]] again, and it's made me a lot more confident in [[JavaScript]] honestly. 

# Health
If I could only do one thing today, I would call my new insurance company and get my numbers needed to begin the prior authorization process for my infusions. They're taking too long sending me my card, and I can't wait any longer. 

www.bcbstx/member.com is where I can see my health info such as group no, etc. If I need help with that, I can call `800-521-2227` and tell them that my group number is `276 693`. 

Ok, done. The info is stored in BitDefender. 

Info to set up Virginia Mason bill pay:
```
Med records num = 7433064
Enrollment code = 99653529

# My role in the production process
I woke up and the first thought to pop into my head is how I add value to a [[data]] product at my job. If I think about it, it makes a lot of sense. Data is a commodity, just like anything else, and it *does* have a physical existence on a server or group of servers somewhere. 

I add value to the session data by verifying that it is either a correct judgement or an incorrect one. These annotated sessions are the raw material that's required by the [[machine learning]] algorithm to improve. 

The core of this idea is that [[Data are a commodity]].
