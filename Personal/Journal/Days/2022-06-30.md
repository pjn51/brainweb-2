# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I woke up to the notification that I got my first paycheck from [[Indeed]]. The total amount was $3,145.88, and the gross amount was $4,528.04, which is going to be a bit higher than the standard, since I didn't get a paycheck on the 15th. So instead of covering 15 days, this paycheck covered 18 days. 

I can see that between the 16th to the 30th, I earned $3,416.67 gross income. If I lose the same percentage from this gross income as I did for the actual check (which won't happen but may be close), that means my normal take-home would be around $2,391.67. That amounts to an annualization of $57,400 which is rather low. I'm not sure I should be paying 30% of my paycheck to healthcare and taxes.

Every day I get done with eight hours of work at Indeed, where I'm constantly learning and adapting to the new job. Then I start loading the car and we head to the townhouse, where we unload and start working on projects. Today I assembled Mimi's cat tree, Eylen power-washed some of the backyard, I tried to troubleshoot the water heater to no avail, and we made final preparations to re-caulk the kitchen counter and bathtub.
