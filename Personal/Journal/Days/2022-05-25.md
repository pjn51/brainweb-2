# 💭 Thoughts
Today there's nothing on my agenda, which is nice. I'm going to use today to catch up on some reading for my meetings later this week, starting with reading group tomorrow evening. 

For some reason, my dataview queries aren't working for today. They're working for yesterday's note. It seems that today's date is being logged as `2022-05-9` which is throwing some errors. I'm going to start keeping my own metadata for creation date since this doesn't seem very reliable apparently. 

I've been learning about the overemployed community. They're people who are working multiple remote tech and IT jobs simultaneously. 

I really need to start writing about my feelings again. I used to do it, but I stopped. Today I felt really agitated, and I wasn't sure why. It was probably just because the last week has been a real emotional rollercoaster. I was preparing for the technical interview, which made me so nervous I wanted to throw up. Then I did really well, and had a rush of endorphins that intensified when I actually got the job. Then the creeping anxiety came back as I worried that they might deny me for some reason. I know that isn't a rational feeling, since I had the same worry when I got my current gig at [[Atos]], but I feel it all the same.
