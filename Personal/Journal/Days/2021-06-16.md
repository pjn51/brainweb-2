## Thoughts
Today I have to go get a bone density scan to measure my [[osteoperosis]] around 1pm, and then I have an MRI at 2:45pm. I can't eat or drink anything after 9:15am today. After that, I have a meeting with Tom at 6pm.

The [[MR enterography]] was really not that bad. I think last time I did it I just wasn't healthy and didn't have the energy to handle it. Also, I chugged the liquid this time instead of using a straw and that made it a lot easier. 

Today I saw Collin's tweet that Bezos was eating at the resturaunt where Collin works! Naturally we immediatley went over there to see if he was joking, but he wasn't. When we saw an idling black SUV out front, we knew he was actually in there. We got a seat near his car and waited for him to come out, and then we heckled him! I asked him if he felt bad when warehouse workers died on the job, and [[Eylen]] made fun of his lazy eye! Here's the [video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/SH89GvWhQ7YPPyEc7). I can't believe that I had the opportunity to slightly inconvinience the richest member of the [[bourgeoisie]] in the entire world...
