# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I have my one-on-one with Josh, and I need to finish the reading for that. There are two Starbucks stores going on strike in Seattle today and this weekend, and I want to mobilize branch to go attend a picket downtown Saturday. Josh went down there solo this morning, so he should be able to let us know what that opportunity would look like. 

# One-on-one with Josh
- His picket experience
	- Introduced himself as a member of the [[IMT]]
	- Took 30 min of helping picket to start having political conversations
	- Handed out some flyers he had on hand
	- There was an opportunity to speak, but SAlt took it
- Retrospective on his short break from branch
	- He's too hard on himself
	- Feels limited by social anxiety
