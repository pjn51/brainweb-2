## Thoughts
I have to call the nurse hotline today and ask them if I should go to urgent care to get my abscess / hemorrhoid diagnosed. That's not really a conversation I want to have on the phone, much less in person. But I gotta do what I gotta do. 

Yeah, I really have to go to urgent care. And the nearest one that will accept my insurance is in Renton for some reason. I'm going to take an [[oxycodone]] beforehand so that I can hopefully avoid some of the pain I felt last time. 

Took 5mg oxy at 11:15 am. We went to the urgent care but luckily all I have to do is a five-day course of antibiotics! I ended up feeling really sick and lightheaded because of the oxy so I wish that I hadn't taken it. But I'm glad that I don't have to do anything painful.
