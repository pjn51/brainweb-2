# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to prepare for my two interviews tomorrow and Friday, and to find an AirBnB for [[Eylen]] and I to spend our anniversary weekend in. It's crazy to think that this will be our five year anniversary. 

Today I'm grateful for Eylen's love. We've both grown so much as people in these last five years, and our personalities still seem to be a good fit for each other. I hope that our different interests and priorities in life don't get in the way of that, since I think we're both good for each other. 

# Meeting with [[JT]]
- His discussion with [[CrC]]
	- Need for communication
	- Leaving the military
- Discussion with JC
	- Seems very mature for his age
	- I should discuss involving him with one-on-ones and what he would need to feel more confident about in order to do that
- [[Jacob]]
	- He could probably return to the work soon
	- Having been burned by an organization in the past tends to make comrades less willing to step into leadership
	- Has a pattern of throwing himself into the work, and then falling away
- BHAM comrades
	- Having been burned by an organization in the past tends to make comrades less willing to step into leadership
	- For those who aren't feeling good about their position, find a replacement and train them up

## Meeting with Jake Johnston
- Meeting with Andrew
	- Team lead
	- Runs weekly meetings
	- He asks harder questions tbh
- Experience with finding patterns in data
	- Talk about establishing baselines
	- Talk about general data management and cleaning
- Kinds of data they use for sessions
	- Location
	- IP
	- Device ID sometimes
	- Browser and OS
- Workflow
	- Establish baseline
	- Match session to baseline using the data
	- Grade sessions against baseline
- Edge cases
	- Comes down to personal opinion
	- Better to be too conservative than too liberal
- Generic cybersecurity stuff and tech questions
- IP address format
	- 4 sets of up to three mumbers
	- First set is more general, last is most specific
	- v4 vs v6
		- v6 is newer, allows for more devices
		- Longer string of numbers *and letters*
- "Who is" lookup
	- A query on the IP address
	- You can get a lot of information
- Internal vs external IP
	- Routers set internal addresses
	- External usually ends with zero but not always
	- They use the external IP for grading
- MAC address
	- Not something that they directly work with
	- The hardware ID of the device
	- Doesn't change ever
	- This is the real identifier of the device
	- They don't use it that often since internet signons don't request the MAC address
- Salary
	- They offered 60k, he countered at 65k. 
- MFA
	- Authenticator app for computer login
	- Single factor authentcation is just a password
	- MFA is any form of other authentication
- Frame my stash experience in terms of cyber security stuff
- How is performance evaluated
	- 10% of our sessions have overlap
	- Diagreement rate is monitored and evaluated monthly
- Sessions per day
	- There's no published baseline for how many sessions to do daily
	- Jake grades 40 to 60 per day and hasn't heard anything
- Onboarding process
	- Grading with a buddy for a few hours
	- Then you're on your own
