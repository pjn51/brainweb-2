# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is the day! I have my [[2022-06-13 onboarding]] for Indeed.

Ok, I have a serious dillema. I strongly believe in having a single [[Obsidian]] vault for all my ideas, but I don't want to run into problems having political and personal notes on my work computer. 

Options
1. Risk it and include all my notes
	1. pro: simplest, least-friction approach 
	2. con: erases privacy of my notes
2. Try and create a vault-within-a-vault
	1. pro: ideal approach
	2. con: hard to set up, might not work
3. Split my vaults
	1. pro: most private approach
	2. con: limitations to connectivity, hard to decide what goes where sometimes
