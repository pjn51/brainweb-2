# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I write this from a coffee shop in Ballard. Eylen is getting her eyeliner tattooed, and I'm using it as an opportunity to relax in a neighborhood that we rarely see. I'm at Umbria Cafe, and the coffee is pretty decent. I have to keep an eye on the occupied couch up front, waiting for the occupants to finish their drinks. 

My plan today is to power through another chunk of [[My Life (1930)]], which I've been quickly devouring since I got it two weeks ago. I'm nearly at page 200, which means I've read 14 pages a day on average since I got the book. At this rate, I'll finish the book in 22 days.
