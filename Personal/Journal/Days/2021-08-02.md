# Thoughts
Today I had a strategy phone call with our alliance on Warzone. Then I had a contact meeting with someone who texted [[Jacob]] saying that he was interested in getting involved. After that, I had a one-on-one with [[JT]].

# Notes for one-on-one with JT
- What qualifies a [[workers' party]] versus a [[reformism|reformist]] bourgeois party? Just perception?
	- Big factor is if the organizations of the working class are tied to the party. This is more important than internal democracy.
		- What about the German case where the [[SPD]] preceded the union movement?
- Sears vs Walmart dichotomy
- Prioritize recent editorial for contacts discussion
- [[economic planning]] articles
- JT on the Dem vs RNC splits
	- More likely to see a RNC split that creates a workers' part"
	- "The squad" is overrated
	- RNC ideology is less stable and could morph more easily
	- DNC internal constitution is more of a straitjacket
	- DNC is the main bourgeois party at this point
