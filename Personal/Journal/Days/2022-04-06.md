# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I had the weekday tabling session, which was quite interesting. We were accosted by a member of the Spartacists, who accused us of all the standard insults: we are supporting the "bourgeois lockdowns," we think cops are workers, we wrongly accuse Russia of being imperialist, etc. It would have been more upsetting if the antagonist could speak without his voice cracking, and if the woman with him didn't look visibly embarassed by his behavior. I'm just glad he left without harassing any other people who were talking with us. In other news, we got a contact at Lazy Cow Bakery. Apparently they would be interested in having some sort of community meeting that could somehow be related to socialism... we will see what's up with that.
