## Thoughts
Today is Friday. I still don't feel totally 100% but definitely better than I did earlier in the week. It's just so draining to apply and apply and get literally no traction. Only 2.4% of my applications have even led to a phone screen, and that gets to me after a while. I've sent 85 applications as of today, and I always prepared myself that it *might* take 100 applications to get a job, but now I feel like that's optimistic. If that's the case, I'll have a job in a few weeks! But I doubt that at this point. It will probably take 200 applications at this rate. 

This afternoon I have a one-on-one with Tom, and then I think [[Eylen]] and I are going to go roller-skating with live music!
