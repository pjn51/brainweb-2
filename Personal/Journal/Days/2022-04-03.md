# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we had a birthday brunch with Olivia and Jake, since it's her birthday tomorrow. Then we came home and laid on the couch for a while. I got a notification that I may have been exposed to [[COVID-19]] at the work dinner a few days ago lol. I don't think I'm really going to change any of my behavior though, since I'm probably fine. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
