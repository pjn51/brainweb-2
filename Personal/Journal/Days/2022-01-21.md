# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today, [[Eylen]] is spending her morning working with Maddy in a coffee shop somewhere. I'm glad to see her get out of the house, and I'm enjoying a quiet morning by myself. 

My new webcam was supposed to come yesterday, and I really need it before I start doing TA stuff again next week. If I don't get it by tomorrow, I'm probably going to have to buy one in-store somewhere and then return it after the other one comes in the mail. I don't like having to set up my computer as a camera with my dual-monitor setup. It partially blocks one of my screens and it just sucks. 

Set up one-on-ones between JM and [[CrC]]
