# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for [[Eylen]], who is coming home today. I'll be going to the airport around 8pm to pick her up. Before that, I need to make the final secret preparations for her return home! 

I've been using [[Obsidian]] for 377 days. In that time, I've taken 1519 notes and written a total of 568,514 words. 
$$
\frac{568,514 \text{ words}}{377 \text{ days}}
=
1,502 \text{ words per day}
$$
That's pretty damn impressive! This is about the same number of words per day as Jack London, and over three times the words per day of Hemingway. 

Apparently our disagreement rate as a team is up, so we're supposed to work on that. However, I only had two disagreements this week, so I'm actually doing okay. I should still take some notes on general concepts that I'm learning as I work here at [[Atos]]. It's an important area of knowledge, after all. 

Eylen wants me to make some chicken fajitas for dinner tonight, because apparently she's not sick of Mexican food!
