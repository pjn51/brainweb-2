# Thoughts
Today my mission is to go to [[2021-09-04 branch]], and then go to the Day In, Day Out music festival. 

Today I'm grateful for the new Jupyter plugin for [[Obsidian]], where I will apparently be able to execute [[Jupyter Notebook]] scripts in Obsidian! I can't get it to work though. 

```jupyter
print('hello world')
```

Today we went tabling at the Pride festival in Cap Hill, which was a total bust, and then we went over to UW and that was more successful, even with the student body not arriving for another two weeks. I think that we're going to see a lot of interest from the student body this year. 

Day In Day Out was fun! We saw KAYTRANADA this evening, as well as some other artists who weren't as good. It was a weird feeling to be among so many unmasked people, and both [[Eylen]] and I want to get tested for [[COVID-19]] now.
