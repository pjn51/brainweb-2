## Thoughts
Yesterday I was looking at a lot of advice for [[enneagram Fives]]. I think that I should try and get out of my head more and connect with others, as well as my own body. That's what inspired me to create the [[hobbies]] note - I want to round myself out a little more. 

I had an informational interview later today with a Starbucks data scientist but he just pushed it to next Monday. I should make sure to reach out to him on Sunday and remind him. I don't like the idea of waiting another week before I apply to this position but oh well. I'm not going to cold apply since I think I might get excluded since I dont have a master's degree and the position asks for one.

I scheduled time to talk with Jen Wednesday morning about my general [[career]] strategy.

Tonight is the selection of our [[bachelorette]] candidates.
