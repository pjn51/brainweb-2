# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Well, I accidentally deleted the last week or so of my notes. Fuck. That's what I get for not backing it up. 

SCOTUS overturned Roe v. Wade today. There's going to be a big protest this evening at the federal courthouse. 

Freeman was causing a bit of drama on the Slack, basically advocating for adventurism. He said we should bring gas masks to the protest, and I responded that if it came to that, we should leave. He said that he wouldn't leave if a confrontation started, and kind of implied that we would be abandoning the workers if we decided to leave or not engage in that kind of adventurism.
