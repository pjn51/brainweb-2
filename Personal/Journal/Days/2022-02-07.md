# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
As I logged in to work this morning, I saw that I've been migrated over to the new grading tool. I'm a little nervous because I'm not sure what this new tool means for my work routine of waiting 13 minutes between grades. Hopefully I can continue to do what I have been doing, but I'm worried that they might have built some oversight into the system, and they might be able to see that I'm not active for long periods of time in between grades. 

Yesterday I glanced through the [[Metis]] alumni list and saw that there are 30 or so data engineers who went to Metis. That's great news for me, since I can get one or two of them to agree to a short phone call. 

People to reach out to:
- [ ] Janet Carson (at Echodyne)
- [ ] Jay Marshall Coskey (at Facebook)
- [ ] Jeremy Lehner (at Usermind)

# Call with Chris Crane
He oversees 5 soldiers directly, in total the section has more people. He's a captain. He used to be a battery commander overseeing 80 people, so that's sort of his "rank." This recent trip was his first large-scale training mission. 

He will likely be out of the army by the end of the year!
