# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for my friends who got me such nice presents yesterday when we celebrated my birthday. Jeff got me [[How To Take Smart Notes (2017)]], which has been on my wishlist for a really long time. 

We need to remember to ask our realtor these questions: 
1. Does it make more sense to have as strong of an escalation clause as possible, or to water down our escalation clause in favor of including an appraisal gap?
2. How do short term rentals like AirBnB work in regards to the rental cap and bylaws?
3. Will the [[600 21st Ave]] sellers provide a seller's disclosure report?
4. Will there be an earnest money deposit, if so, how much?
5. Should we write a personal story in the offer?
6. We have half of the down payment in stocks at the moment. At what point in this process do we need to have all the money on hand?
