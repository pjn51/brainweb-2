# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to make it through this weird spell of dizzyness and nausea that I woke up with. It feels like I'm wasted but obviously I'm not. I really hope this isn't [[COVID-19]] or something since that would mean that I couldn't make it to National Congress next weekend. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that my symptoms seem to be going away after I drank a bunch of water and sat on the couch. As of noon, I feel all better, so I guess I was just dehydrated or something? Weird.
