# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for my friends and family. I cleaned the house today since we have a repair person coming to inspect our heater. A night or two ago, it started sparking and smoking a bit, so we want to get that looked at ASAP. I'm glad that it didn't start a fire or anything, and I'm grateful that we were home when it happened. 

I've been looking around, trying to learn more about [[PKM]] and the best way to set up a vault. After looking through the vaults of some who've been posting videos on the topic, I realize that I should be more confident in my own system. So far, I'm not impressed by the vaults of others. This might just be because each vault system is optimized for the user and is super personal, but I have written a ton of notes in here, and I wouldn't be too shocked if I'm just getting knowledgeable about how to organize information. 

[[How can I effectively organize technical info?]]
