## Thoughts
I got really high last night and was thinking that my life is falling out of balance a little bit. I'm not keeping up with the basic tasks of life like cleaning and feeding myself. I think I'm just getting really burnt out and having mini collapses over and over with little bursts of energy in between. 

Today I have a phone call with Terri Walton, who is a career counselor. I have to decide if I want to pursue her services, which as of right now I don't think I will. I just don't think it's probably worth the money, but I'll let her describe what she can offer. 

## Questions for Terri
- What services she offers
- Cost of services
- Can it improve on current plan
	- 20 apps per week
	- Leveraging alumni connections
	- Trying to network
- Terri's comments
	- New team is more formal than I need
	- Looked at my Linkedin, I should list more skills
	- Remove STASHLOGIX from headline, put more keywords there to draw search attention
	- Consider adding example classes from WWU
	- Be specific and targeted in the ABOUT section
	- Yes the Job is Mine - 4 steps to get the job
