# Thoughts
Today my mission is to keep the ball rolling. I feel like I'm heading in a good direction in terms of [[productivity]]. 

Today I'm grateful for the notes and journals that remind me of the last few years. Today I read through all my old journal entries to get a glimpse of what life was like at [[WWU]]. It's really nice to have my thoughts in a physical format, since I included all sorts of drawings and snippets from various things. On the other hand, I think it's much easier to write in a digital medium like [[Obsidian]], and this is honestly more permanent, since it's backed up in multiple places, while a journal can be lost or destroyed. I think I'll start drawing again in there though. 

Leon wants us to be messaging students who haven't gotten a status check in a little while. Especially for the flex students. 

I spent a lot of time trying to make the editor font Monokai, but no luck. I just can't get it installed on my computer, which I should really be able to do. It's a really popular font. I can't find it anywhere though, and wherever I find it, it can only be added to Sublime Text or something. Very frustrating! Oh well.
