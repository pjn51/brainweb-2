# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We got back from the cabin earlier today. It was nice to get away from the city for a little bit, and forget about all the things we've been thinking about since we moved to the new townhouse. 

I spoke with Atticus today and invited him and Noah to Seattle. I hope they can schedule something for September or October, it would be nice to host them here and show them the city. 

I registered for the International Marxist University today, although I suspect that I'll only be able to attend a few sessions. I hope they publish recordings of the lectures, there are some interesting ones that I'd like to hear.
