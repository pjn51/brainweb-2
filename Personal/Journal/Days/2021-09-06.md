# Thoughts
Today my mission is to get back to normal! It's been a crazy weekend of partying and I really need to re-establish some sanity around here. It's also my Dad's birthday and I need to send my gift *today.*

Today I'm grateful for how chill my parents are. I don't have to stress about sending the gift late, I know my Dad won't really mind.
