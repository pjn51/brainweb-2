# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to relax and try to prepare for a week that feels like it will be hectic, but really has no right to be. I don't know why I woke up today feeling like there was so much going on, the only thing on the schedule today is our Japanese Breakfast concert tonight, which will be really nice I think. I think that masks will be required, which will suck, but we will see. 

Today I'm grateful for getting as far as I have with the Atos interview process. My third interview is next Friday! I *really* hope I get an offer, even though the salary isn't that great. It's still good, but not like a data science role. But for how easy it apparently is, it's a great deal. 

I realize that I can search for the phrase "Today I'm grateful for" and find a nice list of everything that I've been grateful for since I started doing this in my daily notes. I like that. 

I made a really cool "red wedge" sticker and put it on my computer. I also made a "PN" sticker but I decided that it didn't really fit either my phone or computer that well.
