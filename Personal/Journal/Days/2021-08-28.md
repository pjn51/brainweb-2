# Thoughts
Today my mission is to continue to host Evan! We're having lunch with his parents, and then Cinder and Christine are coming over and we're heading to a surprise party for Tristan this evening. 

Today I'm grateful for my friends who make life fun.

I did some research on [[ketamine]] today, and I think it could be a good drug for me to take at parties that would replicate alcohol, as long as I take small doses.
