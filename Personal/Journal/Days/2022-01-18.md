# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
I'm really looking forward to the intro Aikido class that we're going to take this evening. I even had a dream about it. This is one of the very few things that I've actually thought up, and actually initiated lately. It feels really nice to have something new to look forward to, and I might really get into it and have it become a part of my weekly routine which is exciting to think about. 

But before that, I really want to focus on coding some today. 

I also have a zoom meeting with Drew and Tom from Bellingham, where we're going to discuss the joint meeting of our branches. There are a few things we must get through:

- [x] Confirm the date and time of the meeting
- [x] Decide on a meeting topic 
- [x] Decide who will lead off
- [x] Decide who will chair the meeting

Touch on external work and geographic challenges in the overview of Seattle work.
