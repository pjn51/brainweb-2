# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
[[Hayden]] canceled our OoO that was scheduled for today, which is kind of nice. I have a bit more time before my infusion this afternoon. 

I accidentally arrived for my infusion an hour early, so I headed to Keladhi Bros, a nearby coffee place. It's really nice! Spacious with lots of light and large tables. It's pretty far from my house which is the only real downside. 

[[Eylen]] has been categorizing her memory box, arranging everything by year on the floor in a big circle. It's shown me the value of keeping little things, like cards or letters. I want to start my own collection so that I don't miss the opportunity to remember the past through physical artifacts. 

I want to write a letter to myself in five years: [[A Letter From 2022 to 2027]].
