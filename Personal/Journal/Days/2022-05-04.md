# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Well, today I feel horrible. My head is pounding, my body aches, and I have zero energy. At least my fever seems to have subsided since yesterday evening. [[COVID-19]] really fucking sucks. This is going to make me more cautious going forward, I really don't want to do this again!

I've taken a lot of naps today, and every time I wake up feeling a little bit better. At this rate, I'll be symptom-free by tomorrow evening.
