## Thoughts
We've been looking at this house [listing](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1810-E-Republican-St-APT-11-Seattle-WA-98112/2121496766_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=txtshare) in Capitol Hill. It's crazy to me that I may be able to afford that kind of place pretty soon if I got a job. [[Eylen]] has enough savings to cover a down payment and we just need the income to make mortgage payments of $2000 or so.
