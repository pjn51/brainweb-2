# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to ace my [[2021-09-23 Atos interview]]. I feel pretty prepared and I expect it to just be a culture fit interview, no technical questions, although I feel that I'm also prepared to answer any technical questions they might throw at me. 

Today I'm grateful for our parking spot, which allowed me to go to Trader Joe's yesterday and get some good breakfast stuff.
