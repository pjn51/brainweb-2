# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I had [[2022-05-14 branch]] and then Eylen, Elizabeth, their friend, and I went to a zine pop-up in Finney Ridge. We walked through the neighborhood and talked, stopping to get some too-sweet Vietnamese coffee and some art supplies. We came home and cleaned the house, only to learn that Secret, the amazing dog from Bellingham, had tragically lost her battle with leukemia. That was really sad to hear, but I know that dog had a great life 🥲

My biggest win today was that I finally cleaned the house. The biggest challenge was the low turnout at branch, and still finding a way to structure what was meant to be a branch-wide discussion into a more personalized conversation.
