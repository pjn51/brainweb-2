# Thoughts
Today my mission is to get some stuff done, and to relax on one of my days off. Next week I will be working every day except Thursday, so I want to prepare for that. 

Today I'm grateful for my daily routines. They make me feel safe and grounded. 

Today I have [[2021-09-02 AC]] and [[2021-09-02 with Dr. Zisman]]. I'm also going to get my cracked tooth fixed, and I need to remember to schedule a fitting for a new mouthguard at that session. I might have to find an orthodontist for that actually.
