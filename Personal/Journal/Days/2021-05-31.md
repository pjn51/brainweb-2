## Thoughts
Today we're going to have dinner with [[Eylen]]'s parents to celebrate Memorial Day. I really need to get a little more on top of job stuff, I haven't applied to anywhere since the 25th. It's just so hard to keep doing it since I have things that I care a lot more about getting done. 

We just heard that Vivien's ex, Chase, died of an overdose. I feel #emotion/sad that he wasn't able to turn things around, and it seems like things just got worse for him since the last time I saw him. He always seemed like an unstable guy and I guess that didn't change in the last few years. It's kind of a bleak milestone that this is the first person from my age group that I know who has died.
