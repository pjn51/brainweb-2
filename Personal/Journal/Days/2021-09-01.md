# Thoughts
Today my mission is to go to the bone density clinic and make it home in time for work! 

Today I'm grateful for my insurance. I can actually prioritize my health without bearing the costs in this insane system. 

Today I met with a doctor at the UW Metabolic Bone Disease Clinic --> [[2021-09-01 with Dr. Ott]]

Fall is finally here. I'm grateful that the weather has begun to cool off a little bit, so now I can comfortably wear long pants when out and about most of the time. I really savor this time of year, the small period where the weather has cooled but the sun is still around.
