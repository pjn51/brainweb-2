# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for having new insurance that allows me to go get some new glasses frames. We're going to do that today around lunchtime. We actually decided not to get any, since their selection was a bit limited. 

My top priority today is to get my medicine from QFC, and to call Nana. She's been in the hospital and isn't feeling so well, so I'd like to talk to her for a little bit.
