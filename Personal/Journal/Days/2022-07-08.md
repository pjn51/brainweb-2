# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
My parents flew in last night, and today we're going to the [[Seattle 2+U office]]. Yesterday we went on a walk around the neighborhood and got poke at Seattle Fish Guys, which was great. After seeing the office today I think we'll walk around Pike Place and then we're headed up to the Airbnb cabin in Gold Bar. 

I kind of wish we weren't getting that Airbnb, but I think it will be nice to leave our troubles behind for a day or two and go to a place that we aren't responsible for, haha.

I got a new book at Pike Place, [[Marx and Engels' Selected Correspondance (1980)]].
