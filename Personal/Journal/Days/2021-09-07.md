# Thoughts
Today my mission is to do something spontaneous. 

Today I'm grateful for my job. It's a great work-life balance honestly. I just wish it could be more permanent and that I could get more hours. 

Sometimes I really feel paralyzed. There are things that I want to do, but I just can't seem to actually start the process. I want to hang out with Jordan and Rae and Jeff and Ari more. I want to get another tattoo. I want to ride my bike while the weather is still good. But it just seems like everything comes after so many small routine tasks, and by the time I'm done with those I have no energy for being spontaneous. 

This is something that I envy about [[Eylen]]. She has the ability to create goals and then follow through on them. 

I think I just have a difficult time prioritizing things that aren't related to other people. It's difficult for me to say no when Eylen asks me to do things for her, and it's nearly impossible for me to say "No, I'm not going to do that, instead I'm going to do this other thing that I've been wanting to do." I should work on that.
