# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
This evening we have the important [[2022-07-25 BC]]. I hope that goes well. I also have a one-on-one with Nolan.

We've both been longing for a day where we have nothing to do. It seems like there's an endless list of things we have to get done around the house, or fun events that are booked for us. We don't have a totally free weekend for a whole month out - and I used that as an opportunity to go climb at Edgeworks to see if that's something I want to get a membership for.

Finally updating my address and insurance with Virginia Mason today. I really should have done this just after my last infusion, but better late than never.

I'm stressed about the Atos insurance shit, but I think if I get a document saying that I've been removed from Medicaid they will let me cancel the plan. That means I have to call and report another income change, with the hope that they kick me off - which I'm sure they *won't* do, because that's what I *want* them to do.
