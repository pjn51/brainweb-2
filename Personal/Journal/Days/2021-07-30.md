# Thoughts
I woke up this morning to an email letting me know that Code3 actually decided to move forward with my application! Now I'm supposed to do a takehome data analysis project, which I think I can blow out of the water. I was really surprised by this, since I didn't feel like the interview yesterday went very well. 

I realized today that I am much more likely to give up on commitments I've made to myself rather than commitments made to others. 

Today [[Eylen]] and I went to Volunteer Park to read, but we saw there was a performance of Alice In Wonderland happening, so we watched that for about an hour. I started feeling kind of bad, and I had to go to the bathroom three times, so we went home a little bit early. I need to take an inventory of the things I've eaten in the last 24 hours...

# Food inventory
Popsicles (had greek yogurt)
Tamales (had red meat)
Shrimp, green beans, rice
Bacon, oatmeal, apple (red meat)
GF bread, mustard, pastrami, turkey (a little red meat)
Tomato, lemon, Mayo  (acidic?)

# Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
