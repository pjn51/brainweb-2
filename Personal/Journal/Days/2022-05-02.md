# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Yesterday, Chris, Jacob, Josh, and I went to a May Day march. We arrived to find a few hundred people, mainly members of different contingents of left wing groups. We handed out flyers and talked with some unionizing Uber and Lyft drivers, who were excited to share their issues they were facing. The march was long and hot, heading all the way from Judkins Park to the International District. We decided to head back when we heard that the actual final destination was Westlake. Afterwards, Chris and I grabbed some Thai food and talked for a little while. 

There was a leak of a draft SCOTUS opinion today, saying that they're getting ready to overturn Roe v Wade. It's exhausting to live in an era of crazy things happening every year, even if the resulting class struggle is the only way to build a better world. 

Eylen was sick today, but she bravely persisted.
