# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is looking to be a lazy and relaxing day. We were up late last night with friends, so we are just finishing up breakfast as I write this around noon.

We ended up going to the Goodwill Bins in Everett with Celeste, Syd, and Corrine. It was really busy, and it was entertaining to see the dichotomy between the young resellers, hipsters, and older immigrant people there. Afterwards, we got Korean BBQ and went back to Syd's place to watch Euphoria.
