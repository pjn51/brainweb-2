# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Eylen and I wanted to go to Rapport today, but honestly I'm too busy with meetings, and Eylen didn't want to go alone. 

# Reading group
No-shows: Freeman, Josh's contacts, one of John's. 
Apologies: Josh, Jacob
Late: Poliana

Derek came, he's a friend / former coworker of John. He spoke up in the meeting pretty frequently, making good points. 

1. What lesson(s) should we draw from the statement that “The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties?”
2. How can Communists “point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality?”
3. What is “capital?” What is “wage labor?” And how do the two relate to each other?
4. What place would the individual have in a Communist society?
5. What do Marx and Engels mean by “abolition of the family?”
6. What is the role of the state, and what form would the state take in a Communist society?

# One-on-one with Jake
Jake recommended that I take the lead with consolidating Freeman, but to bring Josh along to involve him in the process. He also recommeneded that I have this discussion with the Seattle Branch Committee. 

See: [[How can I nurture the branch?]]

	- Innate pull towards supporting the weaker side.
	- This is a similar "lesser evil" situation as we found ourselves in last election cycle.
	- "do-something-now-ism" dominates the slippery activist left.
