# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Last night, [[Eylen]] and I had a very frank conversation about our relationship. It wasn't angry or combative, we just discussed how we felt that our relationship was stallling out in some ways, and that our interests were become less and less compatible. We agreed that if we bought a house together and got married, we would probably feel trapped later on. I'm still processing my feelings from that conversation. As I was trying to fall asleep, I was imagining what it would be like to be single. I would have to find a place to live, which would be stressful. But I think it might actually be the one thing that could shake me out of my isolated nature. It would force me to reach out to others in order to survive. 

After glancing at Zillow to see what studios are renting for around here, I actually couldn't afford to live in this neighborhood in a place with a stove. The rent we're paying for this place ($1,500) is such a steal. If I moved out and wanted to live in Capitol Hill, I would basically be living in a dorm room and paying +$1,000 a month for the priviledge. 

Today has got me thinking about what I really want out of life. I'm scared to make a mistake and throw away something that keeps me happy, but I'm also afraid of settling instead of taking a risk that might work out better. 

Eylen, Christine, Eman, and I went to the Seattle Aquarium today. It was really fun, and I got some good photos and short videos of fish.
