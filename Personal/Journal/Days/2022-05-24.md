# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
The Molchat Doma show last night was fun. They have a very aloof stage presence, and the frontman would silently look at the crowd with a very serious expression while nodding approvingly. It was the most intense use of synthesizers I've seen live, with bass that felt like it was giving your body a massage up and down your back. We went with Jeff and Marina, and it was nice having some friends along.

In Jeff, I can see the effects of de-mobilization on someone's political consciousness. It seems like the longer he's been inactive, the more he's developed political quirks. He's fixated on the fact that during the [[Russia|Russian]] civil war, [[Trotsky]] implemented the execution of deserters and those unwilling to fight. He seems to be of the opinion that this invaidates the Trotskyist project entirely. 

## I got the job!!!
I just got a call from the recruiter, who said a TON of people applied, and that they were going forward with my candidacy. I can't believe it! I only applied for six jobs!
