# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Last night we slept at the new place for the first time. It was much quieter, which was nice, but we woke up bright and early due to the lack of curtains in the bedroom. Today, I continued moving shit, and the wifi got installed.

I had a nightmare that Mimi died, and I woke up in tears. It just so happened that we actually *lost* Mimi around the house *twice* today which made me very uncomfortable. The first time she had crawled behind the washing machine, and the second time she was sleeping completely underneath the blanket on our bed, something that she never does.
