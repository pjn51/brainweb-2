# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today is off to a pretty good start. I worked out right at ten and meditated, and I've already cleaned the kitchen before 11 AM. I need to counter the false narriative in my head that I don't have enough energy to deal with the needs of others. I really do! I can get a lot done when I put my mind to it, and getting things done actually gives me *more* energy to work on other things. 

I think we're going to a house showing today right after my disagreements meeting. I'm happy to get out of the house on a rare sunny day. 

My colonoscopy went well yesterday, and Dr. Zisman says that I'm in "endoscopic remission," meaning that no inflammation was detected during the scope. Very good news! 

When trying to guess card numbers, [[Eylen]] got 42 cards wrong in a row. What are the odds of her not being able to guess a single card out of 42? The odds of guessing a single card wrong is $\frac{12}{13}$ or $0.92$, and there were 42 chances. That means the odds of her being that bad are actually $0.92^{42}$, or 3%.
