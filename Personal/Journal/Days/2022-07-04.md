# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we're getting some help from friends in order to move some of the larger furniture. We both took showers here for the first time, and it was a bit of a mess. The hot water did come on thankfully, but it took around 8 minutes to kick in. Meanwhile, the water pressure is horrendous, and the drain is very clogged, which is gross. You would think that somebody selling their home at a $100k+ profit would at least unclog the drains...

I made a [Notion Kanban for house projects](https://www.notion.so/24656e94c1124ce3994c67365b8aa64c?v=cd3e5fc256cc4fb191fc0159353d834f). 

Also, I *finally* figured out how to change the font. I apparently have to do it in both the vanilla appearance settings *and* the Minimal theme settings plugin.

I'm getting more comfortable with navigation using [[vim]]. My plan is to slowly work in additional commands over time. So far I just know how to move directionally, highlight, delete, etc.

Ok, today was a big packing day. We got the couch, TV, dining table, and all my office stuff set up. It really feels like we live here now!
