# Thoughts
Yesterday was really rough. It was so hot, and I just wasn't feeling that good about anything. But today is a day off, so I don't have to think about my job search at all! And I'm going to make an effort to really not think about it. 

Today my mission is to put my energy towards completing the tasks I've been putting off, and set myself up for success. 

Today I'm grateful for...

# Todoist
```todoist
{
"name": "Tasks for today",
"filter": "today | overdue"
}
```

# Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
