# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
This evening we have tickets to go see Alt-J and Portugal the Man. We tried to sell them honestly because we don't even like Portugal the Man and Alt-J's new album kinda sucks. But we couldn't sell them, and I'm sure we'll have a fun time. 

I'm feeling like I'm hitting a brick wall with programming. To get me out of my rut, I'm going to do a short end-to-end data science project, attempting to map suicide rates to economic and social factors per US state. 

Well, we were *going* to see that concert tonight, but I started feeling not-so-good. [[Eylen]] was able to sell my ticket to Sarah, and now they're going while I'm here at home. Honestly, I wasn't super excited about that show, so it's okay that I'm not going. 

I wish there was a way to display images from elsewhere on my computer without having to store a copy inside my vault. That's going to eat up a fuckton of space. But now that I have 100 GB in Google Drive, maybe I should start storing my vault in there anyway. Then I wouldn't have to worry about a thing.
