# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Yesterday, we got a note on our door letting us know that in September, our rent is going up by $130 a month, for a grand total of $1670, compared to the $1540 that we've been paying. This is an 8% increase, and is still lower than the Seattle average of $2,197. 

Today I have [[2022-03-07 coding session]] with Dad and [[2022-03-07 with Dr. Judson]] meeting.
