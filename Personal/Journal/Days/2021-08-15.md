# Thoughts 20
Long term plan: First find BA or data analyst role. Then look at places like Target or Cerner for BA or DA role. Then go to Amazon as a BA or BIE role. Then GTFO of Amazon and get a better job. 

Today we went tubing with some of Tristan's soccer friends. It was real fun, and we actually spent over 4 hours on the water. It was a nice way to get to know a few people too. There's no better way to make friends than to sit in a raft with them for 4 hours!

I came home and finished the second [[Dune (1965)]] novel. It was even better than the first one!

Today my mission is to go tubing.

Today I'm grateful for the fact that I can still be spontaneous and do fun things that I don't usually do.
