# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
This evening, we're going to a Jiu Jitsu intro class. I'm a little nervous because I don't know what the vibe will be like. Hopefully it will be fun, but I don't think I'm going to take this martial art up any time soon. I'm locked into a two-month [[Aikido]] membership and I'm really enjoying it so far. At first, I thought I would be going once a week. Then I decided twice was better, and now I'm thinking three times is best.
