# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to go get a [[COVID-19]] test, and then have my [[2021-10-13 branch]] meeting online this evening. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that I'm still asymptomatic, and that [[Eylen]]'s condition doesn't seem to be deteriorating that much, or at least that rapidly. I think she might just have the flu or something. 

# Call with parents
- Check for floating rate loans
- Fixed rates will try and predict inflation, they aren't idiots
- Call Hal?
	- He can tell us what we need to know
	- His firm has a mortgage program along with it
