# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I'm attending [[2022-02-27 CC]] meeting, or at least the first hour of it. Then, we're going to the farmer's market to get some veggies to ferment later today. 

We now have seven members in the Seattle area. Wow. It was just a year ago that it seemed we would never get off the ground. However, this means I need to think more carefully about how I can keep in touch with all members. I wish there were more comrades that I could really rely on. At this point, Josh and Chris are all I can really count on. [[How can I nurture the branch?]]

I've been having some complex feelings ever since [[Eylen]] got back. On one hand, of course it's nice to have her around, and I missed her while she was gone. On the other, after spending a week to myself, I'm noticing the ways in which she pushes my boundaries more. It's been a goal of mine to establish such boundaries, and I guess it's just going to be a struggle.
