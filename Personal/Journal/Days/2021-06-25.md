## Thoughts
I've been debating back and forth about how cool my new glasses are. [[Eylen]] didn't really seem to like them, and neither did my parents, although I don't think that's *such* a bad sign. However, I saw Collin and Logan yesterday, and they both seemed to genuinely like them. They said these glasses were better than my last pair. That makes me feel better since I like their styles. 

My phone screen went well yesterday. The position pays between $90K and $110K, which is kind of mind boggling for an associate position. There are five interviews between me and that role though, so my hopes aren't too high. EDIT: I found out that I didn't get the role. 😢

I'm going to try and set up another round of info interviews with random Metis alumni. Maybe I can suss out some unposted jobs this way. 

I should probably just take the [[deep learning]] [[Metis]] module. They probably go into more depth than I did in the bootcamp last winter.
