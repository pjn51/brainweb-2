# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I didn't realize it until today, but this evening is when we're having a team dinner in Redmond. I wish it didn't interfere with the reading group tonight, but this is probably the only opportunity I'm going to have to meet my coworkers, and it's worth it. I need to remember to give the IMT Zoom account's credentials to somebody else though, so that they can log in!
