## Thoughts
Today is our last day in LA. We had all-you-can-eat Korean bbq and it was so damn good. The food in LA is truly world class. 

This trip was really nice since we saw all our friends and Evan who I won't see for a while again, but I'm excited to go back home. I'm getting my new glasses tomorrow and I just feel too busy. I want to have a normal week again and get back to my routines. I'm a very routine oriented person, and I feel uneasy when those habits get interrupted. 

## Today's notes
