# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we went to the first day of Capitol Hill Block Party. Beforehand, I tried to pick up more [[ketamine]] from Anton, but he ghosted me! Eylen said it was partially my fault for not following up in the morning and reminding him I was coming by, but I feel like it's on him to remember when his customers are coming. Then, he was going to meet up with me at CHBP and drop it off, but he forgot! Hopefully I'll get it at some point soon. 

CHBP was pretty fun, despite the fact that we're not super excited about any of the performers. We saw Reggie, Flo Milli, and Charli XCX. None of them were people we were fans of going in, but all their shows were really fun. We had a good view standing by the fence a little above the crowd. By the end of the day, we were so tired of standing that we couldn't imagine doing this three days in a row. We got to experience walking home (to the old apartment where we parked) like we always dreamed of when we first moved to Capitol Hill. It's pretty ironic that we moved out of the neighborhood just as CHBP resumed after the pandemic.
