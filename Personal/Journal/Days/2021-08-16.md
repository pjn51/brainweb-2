# Thoughts
Today my mission is to get back in the swing of work and finish *all* of my tasks for today.

Today I'm grateful for the weather. The high today is going to be around 73, with rain that ought to improve the air quality dramatically. I know that I won't enjoy the clouds and rain after a few months of it, but boy is this great after the heat waves of the summer. 

My career situation is honestly really fucked up. I don't actually want to be a data analyst that much. I think the DA role will include a lot of things I dislike, like working with really basic tools, and making business presentations to managers, etc. However, this is really my only choice since I don't have the luxury of being able to just get a shitty job - because I would go bankrupt from healthcare costs. So I guess I have no choice but to find a job that pays more than $70k, and the only place where that seems possible is the tech field, and the best place for me to get into that is through data analysis. 

I applied to a FaithLife position today. It would be pretty funny if right as [[Eylen]] leaves, I enter that world. Kind of convenient actually!
