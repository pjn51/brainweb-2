# Thoughts
Today I'm writing this from a coffee shop, *Cafe Vita* to be exact. [[Eylen]] is at her pole class and I decided to get out of the house. 

Today was actually really great. Working in that coffee shop was really nice, and then we went on a mindful walk. I want to get back into [[meditation]], and hopefully ground myself a little more. Then, we went back home and I had a nice meal, and in the evening I hung out with [[Jacob]] and Ethan. We talked at the park for a bit, and then we played pool at Ethan's apartment complex. 

I realized that if I work three days a week, I can actually technically sustain myself! I really want to be financially independent, so I think I'm going to start working as many hours as I can. 

## Gratitude
I'm thankful that I have enough of a financial cushion to ride out this extended job search. If I had to worry about paying the bills right now, I would be in even worse of a spot. I would probably be working in an Amazon warehouse right now.
