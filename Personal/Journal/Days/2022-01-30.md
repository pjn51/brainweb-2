# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today was a day of home-buying. We took the Link up to Northgate in order to check out a condo. It's in Northgate, which is a red flag, but it's an eight minute walk from the Link station, and it's well within our budget. It's been interesting to see how our standards have changed throughout this process. We've definitely lowered them, as we've realized that the perfect house just isn't in our price range. 

We really liked the place. It has large south-facing windows, two (two!) balconies, and the two bedrooms are large enough for doubling as offices. The only thing we don't really like is the location, but I keep reminding Eylen (and myself) that it only takes 20 minutes from our front door to the Capitol Hill Link station. That's only an added travel time of ten minutes compared to our current location. 

We're going to put in an offer! The asking price is $399,000, but that's a low-ball meant to attract a lot of interest. We're willing to go up to $470,000, and we're waiving inspection and putting in an appraisal gap coverage to the offer. Fingers crossed! We'll know if we got it by tomorrow evening, which is exciting and scary.
