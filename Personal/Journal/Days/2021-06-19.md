## Thoughts
Yesterday we went to Manhattan Beach and hung out on the sand after getting delicious tacos, and then went to the Santa Monica pier. The latter place was really quite something, with so many kinds of people and different social groups. 

Today we're going to Malibu and our friends are going to take some [[LSD]]. I'm not sure if I want to though. I'm not super comfortable at the beach, which is where we'll be, so idk if I want to be on acid there. 

So far LA is a really interesting place. There's so much diversity here and things are very different from WA. There are so many more people of color which is very cool to see. I really get the sense that LA is a vibrant, living city, even though its planned horribly. I didn't really expect to like LA, but I sort of do so far!
