# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I feel like I'm getting more and more sporadic with recording things in here, and that's a good indication of how busy I am these days. I retroactively described yesterday in the previous note. 

Today the plan *was* to go to a tattoo artist's garage sale in shoreline, and then go to the Renegade Craft Fair later. However, I don't think we're going to make it to the garage sale, and that's quite all right. I really want to just do nothing for a little bit, and maybe recover some energy. Eylen's been really busting her ass with all these home projects, and I just can't keep up. It feels like all I can do to just struggle with cooking and cleaning like usual.
