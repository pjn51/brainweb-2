## Thoughts
Last night both of my last remaining contestants in the [[bachelorette]] got sent home ðŸ˜¢ and now I'm out for good. I've read 170 pages of [[Dune (1965)]], so I'm well on my way to getting through it by October haha. 

I'm going to focus my `HUNT` time towards actual job applications rather than time spent applying. I think that's a more important metric. 

Javed Ahmed (the instructor I'm working with this week) gave me his phone number --> 206-512-4420
