# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is day two of my alone time. My plan for today is to divide my workday into two chunks, and spend the middle of the day biking around. The forecast called for fog today, but so far it looks okay for biking. 

I've been working on making a more curated diving off point, and I'm calling it [[001 - center]]. By centering lines of inquiry, I've arrived at a natural separation between inward and outward lines. If I frame it this way, it naturally follows that philosophy is at the center of my thinking, which makes sense. The question of how to understand the world is ultimately a philisophical one. All other information rests on the foundation of epistemology.
