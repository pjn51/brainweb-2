# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we're going to an apartment showing in Capitol Hill. We feel really good about this one, as long as the documents look good and it isn't too loud. It's right next to the freeway so that's certainly a concern. 

There are enough noteworthy things for me to create a note for this property: [[320 Melrose Ave]]. 

Jacob got a job offer for UX! He's going to be making 85k which is great. Hearing how much he's going to be making makes me more eager to look for another job myself. 

I got a message from Poliana saying that she can't continue being a member of the branch because her husband doesn't approve. That really sucked, and it's terrible to think that she's in the kind of situation where she has to make those kinds of sacrifices.
