## Thoughts
Today is the day! We're going to Six Flags and I'm kind of nervous actually. I haven't been on a big rollercoaster in a long time. I also have my [[2021-06-21 info int w Susan Fung]] around 11 today. 

Six Flags was super frustrating. The lines were SO LONG that we only went on 4 rides in 7 hours. To be fair, the rides we went on were terrifying and awesome. There was one called the X2 that had freely rotating seats that changed direction during turns and drops. 

Overall, we felt very drained by the end of the night, especially after one ride where we waited almost 2 hours for a ride that was LITERALY less than 2 minutes. 

This trip has been nice because we get to see our friends, but overall I don't really like LA. I like the people, but getting anywhere is a nightmare and there aren't any nice neighborhoods.
