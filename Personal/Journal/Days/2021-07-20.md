## Thoughts
Today is going to be another rest day I think. I just need a little time to relax and get my shit together, and then I can start really fresh. I've been playing a lot of Project Zomboid, an open-world zombie survival game. It seems really in-depth which excuses the terrible graphics. I've never been too put-off by bad graphics, as long as the gameplay makes up for the lack of detail. 

Eylen has a few weeks left of a Skillshare membership, so it would be a good idea for me to take advantage of that and take a pixel art class or something.
