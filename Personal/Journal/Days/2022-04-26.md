# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Not much to report so far today. I've been going on lots of walks recently to enjoy the nice weather and get out of the house. 

I've been struggling to come up with a shorthand of writing one-on-one for so long. I finally think I've figured it out: OoO. It looks kind of weird, but I think it does the job. 

Jake made a good point during our OoO today, that the BC should probably be meeting more regularly. I'm going to set up monthly zoom meetings where we can discuss how consolidation is going, as well as build a team dynamic with me, Josh, and Chris. That will be good, and will hopefully make Josh more confident in himself.
