# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we had a pleasant workday at Rapport. In the evening I learned that Chris didn't book the Vybe Center, and I had to quickly try and find another place to meet. I applied to book a place in Fremont, but I'm worried that they won't get back to me in time, and we'll have to meet online. It's dissapointing from Chris who'se usually very professional and reliable. Oh well, it's really not the end of the world.
