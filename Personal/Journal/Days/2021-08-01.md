# Thoughts
Today I switched to a monthly note system rather than a weekly note one. I like the naming conventions better, and I prefer to be able to see a little longer of a time summary of my life than a single week at a time. It's more interesting to compare weeks to each other.

# Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
