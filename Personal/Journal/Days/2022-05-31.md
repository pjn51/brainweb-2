# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I have to go water Jeff's plants since they're out of town. In the evening, I have branch committee, but that ought to be really short since I don't have much to talk about. 

I've figured out a way to read PDFs on the Kindle, meaning that instead of using Zotero, I could download PDFs to my Kindle. In a way, it combines the best of both worlds - digital and analog. The only issue is that since you can re-size text, the Kindle tracks annotations by location rather than page. There's also the issue that there's only one kind of highlight, meaning that I can't differentiate between sorted and unsorted annotations. I think it's still really nice though.
