# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We went to the [[Seattle 2+U office]] this morning, and I ran into [[Katie]]! What a coincidence. 

The fallout over the Fightback accusations has reached our branch. During the [[2022-07-25 BC]] call, we learned that Freeman messaged all the other comrades individually, telling them the [[IMT]] had a reputation of covering up sexual assault cases, and saying he was leaving as a result. Now Hayden and Ava are considering leaving the group over this. So the [[2022-08-01 branch]] is going to be a pretty important one for getting them to reconsider.
