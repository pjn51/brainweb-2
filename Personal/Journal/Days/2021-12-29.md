# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for having anchors in my life that prevent me from spiraling off into my own world. 

My top priority today is to stay grounded to reality and those around me. I think it's no coincidence that yesterday, a day where I took 27 notes, was a day where I fought with [[Eylen]] and felt pretty alone and anti-social. Hopefully today I can stay more connected and empathetic. Just remember that [[Love is a verb]]! 

I was thinking about creating a new chore system to reward myself for doing things. Currently, there's no real reward system for this stuff. [[Clear proposes four laws of behavior change]], and I'm currently not benefiting from any of them. 

What if I created a points system, assigning more points to the chores and tasks that I overlook the most. Then, based on the number of points I accrue during the week, I could reward myself somehow. 

This is getting to be a lot of content, so let's put it here -> [[Chore chart project]].
