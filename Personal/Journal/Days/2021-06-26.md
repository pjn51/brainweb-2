## Thoughts
Today I have branch --> [[2021-06-26 branch]]. The high today is $94 \ \text{F}^{\circ}$ so we have all the blinds closed and the fan on. It isn't so bad right now, but its supposed to get up to $107 \ \text{F}^{\circ}$ on Monday. 

I froze some grapes and that's a great snack for days like this. 

Today [[Eylen]] asked me why I don't seem to want to have sex with her that often. I said that it was partially because she made me feel insecure by constantly joking about my appearance. After I said that, she kind of shut down and called me an asshole and said I was just starting shit for no reason. 

Fortunately we were able to have a more productive conversation later, but it always just boils down to the fact that she's still burnt out from my hospitalization in February. I feel like an asshole for thinking this, but it's been four months where she hadn't had to support my health at all, but she seems not to have gotten past it. I just hope that therapy helps her figure out ways of moving past that experience, because I'm getting burnt out too.
