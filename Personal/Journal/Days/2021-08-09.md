# Thoughts
Today I have another contact meeting with Bryce, and then it's the finale of the [[bachelorette]]! We already got spoiled about who wins, and the winner is pretty obvious at this point anyway, but it will still be dramatic. I'm going to make special popcorn for the event!

I feel really good about Bryce. I accidentally sent him the entire [[IMT World Perspectives (2021)]] document instead of the latest editorial, and he read the entire thing! I'm bummed that he's going away to college in the fall, he would have been a good addition to the branch. But hey, it's all about building people, not building the organization as an end in itself. I just have to make sure to plug him into the BDC before he goes off to college.

# Talk with Mom
