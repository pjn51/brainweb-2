# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to have my final day as a [[Metis]] TA, which is exciting. 

Today I'm grateful for finally having *ideas* in this vault as standalone notes. I think it really frees me up to have such a flexible way to enter thoughts into my vault and link between them. I created a [[thought cabinet]] to store my ideas and be able to look at them. There's probably a better way to look at all of these. 

I'm also grateful that neither [[Eylen]] nor I have [[COVID-19]]. We just got our test results back, so I guess Eylen just has some kind of bug.
