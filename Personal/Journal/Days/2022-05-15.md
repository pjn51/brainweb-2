# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we're heading to 99 Ranch to eat Korean food with Eylen's mom for a late Mothers' Day celebration. We don't have much else planned. 

I've been grinding [[SQL]] practice so hard that I had a dream about a SQL query last night. I was able to get to the fourth chapter of [[Learning SQL (2009)]] before lunchtime today. 

# 📝 Today's notes

SORT file.ctime
```
# ✏️ Today's edits
```dataview

SORT file.mtime
