# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to keep it up. I feel like today was rough in the morning, but it ended well. I want to keep that energy going as we get into the workweek. 

Today I'm grateful for Mimi again. I had a dream where she was about to fall off of a big ledge and I was holding onto her by a string, which was quite stressful. I was happy to wake up and see her safely purring in bed. 

I've been having a few nightmares actually. The night before last I dreampt that I had some kind of worms in my veins, and my legs got severed and I could see them all wriggling and writhing inside of me. That was really disgusting. Maybe I'm more stressed out than I realize if I'm having all of these kinds of dreams. 

I color-coded my graph today, and it looks really pretty. When I color code by note type, I can see how much diversity exists in my political notes when compared to my [[data science]] notes. I should do something about that! I'm sure that there are people and organizations and books worth learning about in that world. 

I talked with Jeff this evening, and he mentioned that [[Jacob]] had made some other unwanted advances that I wasn't aware of, and apparently toed the line a little bit with some unwanted touch towards one of Rae's friends. That would explain why they haven't seemed eager to spend time with him lately.
