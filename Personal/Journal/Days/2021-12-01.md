# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for the alone time that's going to come with being solo for the next ten days. We will see if I can treat myself with the care and love that I treat [[Eylen]]. My big goal is to hit up some friends this weekend and do something fun, since that's a role that I really rely on Eylen to perform for me. 

Jacob and I went tabling today, and it was really frustrating how much we were confused with [[Socialist Alternative]]. They're going all out to defend Kshama, and it's reached a fever pitch. We actually had somebody from SA come up to us thinking that we were one of their tables, ready to volunteer! If their own members can't distinguish us, how are the general public supposed to? We need to find a new area for tabling in Seattle. I decided to see how NTK and Nikkita Oliver did in various neighborhoods, and I found that the best places would be around UW and near Columbia City. Those were the real strongholds of these candidates. 

I got the new copy of IDoM today, and it's all about [[historical materialism]]. That's made me think a lot about how [[Morality is historically contingent]].
