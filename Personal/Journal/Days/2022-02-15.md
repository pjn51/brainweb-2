# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Wordle is really hard today. I'm kind of losing interest in that game. I finally got my Robinhood 1099, so I sent my tax documents to the person who is doing Angela's taxes. Eylen and I are hitching a ride on that person too. 

Today is our special lunch at the Space Needle. I think it will be fun! I wish it was sunnier though, it's a bit cloudy. At least it isn't raining. 

I really feel like I need to work on setting healthy boundaries. It's becoming a problem. When I bottle up my resentment, everyone loses eventually. It's not fair to me or to Eylen, so I need to work on communicating more clearly and healthily. 

I did some good work with my [[vault history]] page. Now I can see the number of notes created each month. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
