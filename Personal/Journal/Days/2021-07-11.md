## Thoughts
Today I have [[2021-07-11 info int w Yiqing Liu]]. 

Last night I hung out with Jordan, Rae, Jeff, Ari, and [[Jacob]]. We went over to Jeff's new apartment in Cap Hill, and then we went to the park and a few bars. I had a lot of fun connecting with those people, and I hope that we start to be a more defined friend group. I enjoy spending time with them. 

We took some shrooms and I was pretty drunk so that was also fun and something that I hadn't done in a while. I'm waiting to see how my body feels within the next 24 hours though, to gauge if that's something I could start to do again. 

I feel really productive today but not in a job search way. I'm just getting lots of IMT stuff done and crossing out lots of tasks that have been building up.
