# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we woke up really late, and I'm planning on surprising Eylen with a picnic when she gets back from her pole class 😘. It will be cute when she comes up and sees me with the blanket and snacks spread out 😊. It was pretty cold so we didn't stay long, but it was nice to do something sweet and spontaneous.
