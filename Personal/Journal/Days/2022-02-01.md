# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Yesterday was really stressful. We spent basically the whole day waiting to hear back on our offer to buy a condo in Northgate. We didn't get it. At the time, I was really disappointed, but I also breathed a sigh of relief to have avoided the massive commitment that buying a condo for nearly half a million dollars would have been.
