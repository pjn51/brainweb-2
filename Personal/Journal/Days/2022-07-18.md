# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Another work week. My big goals this week are to call the Rinnai water heater hotline or at least look on some forums to deal with what we now suspect to be a hot water pressure issue that's causing variation in temperature. 

We *finally* got the faucet replaced last night. We had to actually drill through two nuts that were way too tight to get off. It was a huge pain and metal shavings got all over the place. Luckily neither of us were injured during the process, but the new faucet kind of sucks so we're going to order another one. It's gonna be way easier to install the new one though, so I'm not really mad we're having to keep working on it. 

This evening I have [[2022-07-18 JC 1o1]] and another [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]] session.

I should get a trash can for my office. That would be nice.
