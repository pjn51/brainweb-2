## Thoughts
Today is my first day back on the grind after being so burnt out since the weekend. I'm just going to focus on getting some applications in, and then ease my way back into the other things I was trying to do. 

This period has made me think a lot about [[boredom]]. I went ahead and made some notes for other states of [[emotion]] that I have felt and have thoughts about. 

I just took a ML skills test on Linkedin on a whim, and I scored in the top 5% of those who took the test. I didn't even try that hard! That made me feel good. 

The Warzone game is heating up, so I'm going to compile some of my game notes in [[The Art of Warzone]]. 

## Insurance for [[Eylen]]
We looked into some plans, at her monthly income of $4,532, she can get plans that have around a $230 monthly premium and a $6,000 deductible. That doesn't include dental, which is around $20 monthly with a $50 deductible. 

If we use Faithlife salary of $35,360 annually, we can get premiums around $80, with deductibles around $6,000. Dental is $20 monthly with a $50 deductible.
