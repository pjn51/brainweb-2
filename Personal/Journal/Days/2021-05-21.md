I feel like I really just want to use [[Obsidian]] for everything. I give up on having a paper journal. The rest of my life is in here, so it feels right for this app to contain my general thoughts and stuff. Not sure what to write for today though. But today is the inagural day of journaling in Obsidian. 

Another good thing about journaling in here is that I can do [[exploratory data analysis|EDA]] on my thoughts even more effectively. 

I never heard back from my troubleshooting request for Dual. The very last step isn't working and that's really frustrating to me. I wish I could just get it working but I should just be patient since I don't really need it, it's just a cool toy basically. 

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
