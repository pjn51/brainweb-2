# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is the second day fully living at the townhouse, and it's starting to feel slightly more like home. We caulked the bathtub last night, so today we're planning on bringing over the shower curtain so that we can actually use it. I also drove to Redmond to pick up a free grill, and we're preparing for getting all our work stuff here today and tomorrow. 

We got wifi installed yesterday, and it's blazing fast. Like 700mb/sec fast. Pretty sweet, but what do you even need speeds like that for? I've been almost looking for ways to enjoy it haha. I guess Netflix won't ever buffer?

When I was getting the grill, I lifted it onto the back of the car and I felt four pops in my upper back. It didn't hurt much, just a dull ache, but it kind of freaked me out and I don't think I'm going to do any heavy lifting for the rest of the move. 

Tomorrow we're getting help from two friends in order to get the rest of my work setup, the couch, and the TV + tv stand. Maybe we'll get the bedframe too. 

I just installed the [[vim]] plugin for [[Obsidian]], and I think I want to learn how to nagivate in it. Not using my mouse would be really nice.
