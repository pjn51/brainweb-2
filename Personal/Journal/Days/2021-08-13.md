# Thoughts
Another hot af day! We're stuck inside this house that smells horrible since we have to keep all the windows closed. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that the Capitol Hill Library is finally open! Yesterday [[Eylen]] and I went there and got a bunch of books. It also has excellent air conditioning, so maybe I will head there this afternoon if the heat becomes unbearable. 

I think that I should just try really hard to become a data analyst. That seems a lot easier than becoming a back-end or full-stack developer. Although I am tempted to stay on the perpetual treadmill of learning new skills, I really just need to apply the skills I have to the current job market.
