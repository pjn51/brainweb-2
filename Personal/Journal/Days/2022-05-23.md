# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
It's over, I completed the final interview rounds for the [[Listing - Indeed Technical Analyst]] position. I feel like I did really well. The live-coding went very well, and I didn't have to look anything up. All my conversations ended on positive notes, and only one out of the four was unwilling to basically tell me "you killed it" at the end of our interview. 

I don't want to get my hopes up, but I already feel really proud of myself for doing so well in the marathon of three hours back-to-back interviews and live-coding. Even if I don't get the job, I feel a lot more prepared for what these interview processes can be like, and I have a clearer idea of what I need to study.
