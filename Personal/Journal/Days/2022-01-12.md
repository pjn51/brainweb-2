# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today's the day of my colonoscopy! I have to drink the rest of the prep later today, and then it's off to the hospital. I haven't eaten anything since 1 PM yesterday, and I can feel my sense of smell heightening when I'm around food. I forgot how extensive this kind of process was, it was feeling routine to me, and I didn't really mentally prepare for it until it was four or five days out. I guess after doing a handful of them it isn't such a big deal for me anymore, but the prep still sucks. It made me shiver just to type the word "prep!" 

Whenever I do these kinds of procedures, it makes me think back to the last time I did them. The last scope I had was in Feb 2020, in the hospital. I remember doing my prep alone in a hospital room, which was much worse than doing it at home, where I could mix ginger ale and take breaks to watch TV and stuff. I'm so thankful that remicade is working for me, it's really saving my ass at this point. One year in remission! 

I recieved my Todoist "year in review," which revealed that my most productive day is Monday, and my most productive time is between 10 AM and 12 PM. That makes a lot of sense to me. I postponed the most tasks on Wednesdays, and at 9 AM. I can understand that I guess.
