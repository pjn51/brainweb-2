# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Last night was really fun! Eylen introduced me and Cinder to the friends she's made through Bumble. They're both really nice and interesting folks. I could see us hanging out with them again. 

Today I have [[2022-04-09 branch]], which was sort of a shitshow. We were supposed to meet at the UW library, but they wouldn't let us in since not all of us were students. So instead, we headed over the Husky Union Building which was okay, but it wasn't a private meeting space. We wanted to book Mox Boarding House for branch next week, but they're all booked up. So that means we're headed back to UW which honestly would be fine I think, and it's free!
