# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to get back to my old routine after all our friends have left. Today I'm reviewing all the disagreements I had during training. There are over 60, so this should take me the larger part of 2 days to complete. After I'm done, I'll meet with Andrew and we'll go through them together. 

Today I'm grateful for my job allowing me to have loads of free time for other activities in the day, even if I have to grade a session every fifteen minutes.

John Peterson also got back to me about my article proposal, and he wants to see some bullet points of what I want to talk about in the article. Exciting, and a new way for me to do political work.

Next we're reading *What is to be done?* Read the preface and section one.
