# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to get some shit done on the first day of fall 2021. 

Today I'm grateful for [[Eylen]] for giving me a haircut even though she didn't want to do it. It's nice that I have my own personal stylist who can make my hair look good for free. But the clippers I ordered actually suck, so that's not great. They vibrate a ton and they're *super* loud. 

I decided to switch over to Safari as my browser. Chrome is often really slow, and I want to see how Safari is. The biggest downside is that I can't group tabs in Safari, but I want to see if the speed makes up for that. 

I spent a lot of time today trying to make an automatic maze generator in [[Python]]. I was able to render random grids of black and white squares in varying proportions, but I couldn't quite figure out how to create a pathfinding algorithm to verify if the maze has a possible solution.
