## Thoughts
[[Metis]] scheduled me to work today and didn't tell me, which was annoying. But I got the other TA to take the afternoon session so that I can escape this insane heat by going to a store or the lake or something. It's going to be $105 \ \text{F}^{\circ}$  around 4pm today. It's 10 right now and it's already nearly $90 \ \text{F}^{\circ}$. 

I read an interesting article today, [[Data Science is Different Now (2019)]], that made me think more critically about getting a data scientist job. I think I should probably shoot for data analyst and work my way up. I think Data Engineering would also be interesting, but I really just need to get a job now. I've spent long enough retraining myself, I can't do another pivot. 

## Today's notes
