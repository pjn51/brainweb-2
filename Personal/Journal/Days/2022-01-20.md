# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today is the day of making annoying phone calls. I have to call the [[Atos]] helpdesk to get my password reset, and then I have to call my insurance provider to ask why I keep getting prior authorization notifications that disappear when I go to look at them, and then I have to call and cancel my credit card since I got a new one. 

Looking back on this, I only ended up making the one call. These sorts of things are easy to push back, aren't they? 

I noticed that I haven't been making so many notes lately. I've been reading more and writing less, which I think is ok. I'm not going to push myself to do knowledge work in here if I don't feel inspired to. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
