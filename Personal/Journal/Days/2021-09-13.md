# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to try and take care of myself.

Today I'm grateful for [[Eylen]] because she is going to Trader Joes so that there is food for me to eat for breakfast. Currently I'm eating peanuts since there's nothing to eat. 

I'm trying hard to maintain a positive attitude. I submitted three applications today, so I want to congratulate myself. 

Today I have [[2021-09-13 BDC]].
