# Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for Mimi. She is so cute and precious to me, and no matter what mischief she gets up to I just can't be mad at her. 

Today my mission is to examine how I'm spending my time and see areas I could be doing better. I can easily measure the amount of time that I spend on my phone and computer, but I wish there was an accurate way to figure out how I spend the other 2/3rds of my day. I can guess, but that's probably way off. 

```
|------------------| 18 hours of waking time in a day. 

|------------------------------------| 36 half hours.

|PPPPP-------------------------------| 2.5 hrs phone time.

|PPPPPCCCCCCCCCC---------------------| 5 hrs on computer.
```

So I spend roughly half my waking life on my phone or computer. That's a bit lame, but not unexpected. 

I finally started taking notes on [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989)]]. I've been meaning to start this one for a while but never got around to it until now. It has some useful ideas, but also some shitty ones that I have to sort through to find the gold nuggets.
