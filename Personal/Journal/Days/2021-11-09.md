# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for my job. [[Eylen]] says that my job sucks in comparison with hers, but I like the slow pace. Having to work every 15 minutes is somewhat inconvinient, but I like how it keeps me more productive than I would be if I only had to work a few hours in the day. My hope is that by having eight hours of productive time, I can build in more time for projects, reading, and doing knowledge work in my daily routine. 

I just finished [[Children of Dune (1981)]]. I recieved [[God Emperor of Dune (1981)]] as a birthday present from my Mom, and this is really good timing for me to start the fourth book of the series.
