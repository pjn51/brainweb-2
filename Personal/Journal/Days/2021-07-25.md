# Thoughts
Today is a chill day. I'm just relaxing and reading Dune. I bought the sequel since I finished the first book! I bought it on the 12th, just 13 days ago. That means I read 794 pages in 13 days, for an average of 61 pages per day! That's really impressive, I have no idea how I really did that.  

Today I felt like I was alright again. I enjoyed some moments of boredom that I made sure to have. 

In the evening [[Eylen]] and I reminisced about our time at WWU, and it made me want to take some notes down about my time there so that those memories would live on.
