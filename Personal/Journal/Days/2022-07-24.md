# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Another day of waking up very late because we were at CHBP last night. We headed there again around 6pm to see 100 gecs. This was the last day of the festival, and we were ready for it to be over. Three days in a row is a lot of time standing/dancing! 

I've been processing my feelings about the state of [[democratic centralism]] within the [[IMT]], which I feel has become the primary question for me beyond the specific Fightback allegations. I still don't know how I feel, but I'm carefully reading through some documents of an internal IMT faction that was expelled / left in 2012. They raise some interesting points, but I also want to look at any documents I can find from the IEC point of view on the conflict.
