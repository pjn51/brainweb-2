# Thoughts
Today my mission is to try to get my shit together a little bit. Three days of hosting / going out has left our apartment in total disarray. And there's more people coming over today! I really need to get shit under control. 

Today I'm grateful for friendly Mimi who always spends her morning curled up with us in bed.
