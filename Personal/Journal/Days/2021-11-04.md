# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for...

Eylen is a little salty at me for not giving very good gifts for our anniversary. Of course, she already figured out what I'm getting her, so it's not even a surprise. And the thing is, the only thing that she doesn't know about is coming in the same package, so I can't tell her something else is coming, or else she'll know what it is. 

This happens every year, either at her birthday, Christmas, or our anniversary. I find it really difficult to determine what someone would want for a gift, and I usually don't have the foresight to start planning early enough. I should set alerts a month in advance of these sort of events, because that's how long it usually takes me to think of something. Now anything that I get for her will be tainted by the fact that she already told me she was disappointed in the gifts that I was going to get her. 

I tried to compile a list of good gift ideas in Todoist, but Eylen went out and purchased all of them on her own, so that's no help. At least it let me know that I was on the right track in terms of what I was going to get her. I think I can [[Give better gifts by listening to complaints]].

This must have something to do with the fact that [[I have a tendency towards passivity]]. I just coast along doing the same old thing until I find myself stuck in a situation that I needed to prepare for. 

In other news, I got an email inviting me to apply to a position as a tutor for some sort of bootcamp. I have a call today with Elizabeth, the Metis student who works there now.
