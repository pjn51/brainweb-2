# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I had [[2022-05-28 branch]], where we voted in our 9th comrade, Aerie. They seem interesting, and are eager to learn more which is always a great sign. However, we've had very low attendance at branch lately, and that's a bit of a bummer. On the bright side, most people have good excuses for not being there - I don't think there's an issue of professionalism here, it's just how it is. A few people are out of town, and Freeman has an insane works schedule that makes it hard for him to make meetings. I feel proud of how the branch has gone, and I'm even more commited to get to ten comrades and beyond. 

After branch, Marina, Eylen, and I went to the SLU Saturday Market, where there were a bunch of food trucks. It was good to get out of our neighborhood and have some nice food. Eylen and Marina spent some time looking at clothes, and I was a little bored and wandered around. I don't really enjoy looking at clothes, it feels forced whenever I thumb through a rack. I would *like* to enjoy shopping for clothes, and I know I really need to since I don't have much to wear.
