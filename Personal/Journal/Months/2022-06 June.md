# Summary
This month was really centered around us closing on the townhouse, and me starting my new job at [[Indeed]]. We had to make a ton of high-pressure decisons related to the closing, but all worked out in the end. 

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ First week
We saw Bean and Jake's new Federal Way house, and we signed on a townhome in Judkins Park! This event alone made this month incredibly noteworthy, as our six-month search came to an end. It was a rollercoaster of hesitation, determination, and doubt about if we could really afford it, but the math checks out. 

Politically, I chatted with Bryce about my article, and Jacob decided to step down to sympathizer. That was a bit dissapointing, but it was mainly clarifying. Branch was great, with a few more people than the last two weeks.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second week
We sent the earnest money to the escrow people, we locked in our mortgage rate, and we got a quote for homeowners' insurance. This was a week of high-impact decisions that came with a lot of second-guessing and stress. We're preparing for even more, as we have to move, do some home improvement projects, and I start my new job.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third week
Caveat: I accidentally deleted my notes from the rest of this month lol. This was my first week of my new job at Indeed, which was really hectic. This weekend, we saw La Femme, which was a great show.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fourth week
This week, I hung out with Jacob, I did a ton of onboarding meetings, and had a relatively uneventful week other than that.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Fifth week
We went to pride, got the keys to the townhouse, and started moving. This week felt really long since after work, we would go move stuff for five or six hours, and then get home and immediately fall asleep. We also saw Indeed's Seattle office, which was extremely nice. I think we're going to make a habit of working from there once a week.
