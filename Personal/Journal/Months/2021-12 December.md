# Summary
This month had its highs and lows. We spent time with friends and had some fun, but I also felt kind of lonely and disconnected from others. The holidays always stress me out, since they remind me that I have a hard time forming emotional connections and deep relationships.

# First week
Eylen left for Mexico. I went out with Jordan, Rae, and Jeff.

# Second week
This is when the fun of being home alone began to wear off. I spent my time doing contact meetings, one-on-ones, and by watching *The Wire*. Eylen came home on Thursday, we saw Tom perform on Friday, and our heater exploded and needed to be replaced.

# Third week
We went to a craft fair with Celeste and Katy, I made a really cool dataviewjs page, Metis offered to re-hire me as a TA, we went to a pottery class, and we went to a screenprinting class Wednesday. I called Nana on Saturday, since she's in the hospital with an infection. Eylen went to get her booster shot.

# Fourth week
At the start of this week, Eylen got a booster vaxx and felt kind of sick. We discovered a wound on Mimi, and had to put her in a cone! I made good progress in the stash project. We went to Vadim's house for an extended-family Christmas Eve dinner. Then, it was actually Christmas on Saturday. 

Overall, I felt burnt out, disconnected from others, and lonely this week.

# Fifth week
It snowed a ton, cancelling our plans with friends. I sold some books, got some new ones, and Eylen's friends came over for a gift exchange. Overall, I felt myself spiraling off into my own world this week, and I tried to counteract that by getting more into meditation and trying to unplug. For NYE, we hung out at Marina's place and kept it pretty low-key.
