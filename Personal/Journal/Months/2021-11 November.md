# Summary
This was a week of travel and celebration. We started the month out by going up to Vancouver in celebration of our 5-year anniversary and my birthday. The next weekend, we went climbing with friends for my birthday, and we ended out the month by flying to Boulder for Thanksgiving. Overall, this month was pretty nice, with lots of seeing old and new friends and getting out of the house. The pace was pretty fast, but it was really enjoyable.
