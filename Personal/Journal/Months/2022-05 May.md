> [!summary] 
> This was a real rollercoaster of a month. I got COVID, ate like shit, went to bed hungry, and landed an amazing role at Indeed. I felt like shit a lot, but I also felt amazing when I nailed my interview, and even more so when they told me they were choosing me out of a TON of candidates. This month really changed the trajectory of my life, at least in terms of money. I'm making a fuck ton of it now.

> 💣 - getting covid, missing branch

> This week started off with the May Day rally, and ended up with us getting [[COVID-19]]. We spent the week in isolation, and I had to miss branch.

> ⭐️ - I did well during the interview process for the [[Listing - Indeed Technical Analyst]]. I'm really excited for this role!
> 💣 - This week it was really challenging to cook and take care of myself.

> This week was really all about those interviews, and other than that it was a haze. I didn't do a good job taking care of food, and I went to bed hungry a few days in a row. As the week ends, I'm hoping to turn that around, since it just isn't the way to live.

> [!three] 
> This week, we ate dinner with Eylen's mom to celebrate late Mothers' Day. I spent the whole week studying SQL in preparation for my technical interview early the next week. I had a chat with Dr. Zisman about basically nothing, since I'm feeling good. I had an infusion on Friday, and I spent the weekend at branch and cramming SQL prep. It was a bit of a stressful week as I prepared for my interview. However, I didn't have to cook that much since Eylen's mom prepared some great food for us.

> This was a rollercoaster of a week. I was preparing for the technical interview, I nailed it, and I actually got the job! As of writing this, I still can't believe that I really got the job. I'm not used to having these many ups and downs, and it's taken a toll on me this week. I accepted their offer on Friday, and I'll begin onboarding on Tuesday most likely. I'm expecting a lot of Indeed branded swag.
