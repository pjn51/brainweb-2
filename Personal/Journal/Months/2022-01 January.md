# Summary
This was a month of decisions, big and small. The small decision was which martial art I wanted to invest my time into, Aikido or Jiu Jitsu. That occupied my mind for a good portion of this month, but it was overshadowed by the decisions we had to make late into the month. We found a nice condo by northgate, and decided to put in an offer. After two days of gut-wrenching nervousness, compromise, and lots of number crunching, we lost out on the condo because of our unwillingness to expose ourselves to the risk of a low appraisal. That was really stressful, and it made this whole month feel like we were no longer kids.

# First week
This week, we started the year by trying to appreciate where we live - we spent time in Chinatown, and tried to get out of the house. I tried to make an effort to reach out with friends, and I saw Jacob, Jordan, Ari, Jeff, and Rae. I got back into political work, which was nice. However, [[COVID-19]] is back on the rise and we decided to move branch online for the time being. 

This week was a refreshing, hopeful start to the year, but also had its stressful and overwheming moments.

# Second week
This week, I read a lot of books and had a colonoscopy, which showed that I'm in "endoscipic remission." We spent our free time by hanging out at coffee shops and going to a trampoline center in Tukwilla, as well as a few of Eylen's old workplaces.

# Third week
All my [[Marxism|Marxist]] books arrived! I had my first Aikido class, which I really enjoyed. I spent the week coding and preparing for the resumption of my TA position (which never ended up happening). Syd came down for the weekend which was a nice end to this otherwise unremarkable week.

# Fourth week
This week, I found out that I wouldn't be starting as a TA for [[Metis]] again. I got into the swing of [[Aikido]], going three times this week. However, I was torn between that and [[Jiu Jitsu]], which I also took a class of. We went to two apartment showings, and we decided to put an offer in on the unit in Northgate right by the Link station! This was a week chock full of decisions, like Aikido vs Jiu Jitsu, and deciding what to do about the homes that we saw. Those kinds of decisions are exhausting, but necessary in order to take charge of the direction of your life. Because even doing nothing and going with the flow is a choice.
