# Summary
This was a fun month! We returned to in-person branch meetings as political work heated up. We got two new members and started a mid-week tabling session in addition to the weekends. We went on a four-day trip to Portland for Eylen's birthday which was also fun. We really let loose there! Towards the end of the month, it was apparent that spring is really here. The cherry blossoms were blooming and the weather was in the 60s.

# First week
This week, we celebrated Christine's birthday, went to the aquarium, and we returned to in-person branch meetings Eylen and I also had a very frank conversation about our relationship, which went well I think.

# Second week
This week we went to a pole sports competition, got a notice that our rent is going up in September, I met with my nutritionist, I met up with Killian which was fun and surprisingly not awkward. We will see if I hang out with him again, but I wouldn't be opposed at all. We had another housing fiasco, and we're thinking about finding a new realtor because of it. Jacob got a job offer for UX finally!

# Fourth week
This week was mainly spent in Portland. We had a ton of fun hanging out at the massive Airbnb, chilling in the hot tub, and drinking lol. We went into town a few times which was also fun. When we came back, we realized that we got some kind of rash from the dirty hot tub, which was really gross. Also I got an infusion and the associated bloodwork revealed that my liver is working on overdrive to process all the [[ketamine]] that I took on the trip lmao. Time to ease off I guess.

# Fifth week
This week, I bailed on our Alt-J concert, we went tabling in the middle of the week in Fremont, and I started to head back into data science as a path forward. Also, I got removed from Medicaid which was annoying but expected. Eylen's foot got all messed up from the trip, but it started to get better relatively quickly. As the month ended, we enjoyed the warm weather and relatively clear skies.
