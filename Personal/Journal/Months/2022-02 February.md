# Summary
This month was interesting. It started out with a little rollercoaster action in the housing search, and then it became a little turbulent between me and Eylen. We fought and then she left for 10 days, which was a nice break honestly. I spent time alone which felt good, and I realized that I would survive without her. When she came back, it felt like I could stand up for myself more.

# First week
I got an invitiation to a "anti-capitalist coalition," I caught up with Jacob, talked with JT, and also with John. On Saturday we went to a house showing and then hung out in Madrona. This was really a week of emotional recovery from the rollercoaster that the Northgate condo represented. Otherwise, it was pretty unremarkable.

# Second week
This week, I had a few contact meetings, we submitted another offer on a townhouse (we didn't get it), and we went out with my Seattle friends. It was nice to see them. Other than that, we didn't do much this week. At branch, we decided to start a reading group, which was exciting. The work is developing fast right now.
