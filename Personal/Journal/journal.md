# Introduction
This is the home page for my journal. The notes within will be tagged #daily. My process is kind of a hierarchical summarization workflow. Each day, I summarize what I did and how I felt. I do the same for each week, based on daily notes, and for the whole month. At the end of the year, I will summarize all the monthly summaries and end up with a year summary.
