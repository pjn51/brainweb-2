## My weekly reflection
This week, we finished up our trip to LA. On Sunday, we went to the Getty Center, Hollywood, and the Griffith Observatory. On Monday, we went to Six Flags, and on Tuesday we went to Korean BBQ before our flight. I got my new glasses Wednesday, which took a little getting used to, but I think I like them. Thursday I had a phone screen at PitchBook for a really well-paid position. I also decided to make more of an effort to cut out refined sugar from my diet. In the evening, I went to the bars with Collin, [[Jacob]], Logan, and Morgan. That was really fun! On Friday, I found out that I didn't make it to the next round for the PitchBook role, which sucked. On Saturday, I went to the branch aggregate ( [[2021-06-26 branch]]) and spent the day mainly playing video games. 

Overall, this week was all about getting back to my normal routine, and trying to get back into the groove of looking for a job and improving my diet a bit. I didn't meet any of my productivity goals, which the LA trip is partially to blame for. However, the days that I did put in work, I didn't do enough. Only 5 total hours of productive work this week.
