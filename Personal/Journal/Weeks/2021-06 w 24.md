## My weekly reflection
This week, Eylen's friend Sarah came over, we watched the first episode of the [[bachelorette]], my parents put down Emma, I got the bodycam footage of my arrest back, we got a new couch, and it was Christine's highschool graduation.

Overall this was a hectic and a little bit of a sad week, especially with Emma. I'm starting to feel some serious symptoms of [[burnout]], which is worrying since I'm not really pushing myself to do anything, just trying to do daily tasks.
