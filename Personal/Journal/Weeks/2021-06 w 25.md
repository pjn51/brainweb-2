## My weekly reflection
This was the first week that I'm keeping track of in [[Obsidian]], so it's kind of incomplete regarding the pomodoros. 

On Sunday, I dealt with my abscess. Then we went thrifting and got some nice stuff. On Wednesday, I had my bone density scan and MRI, and we saw Jeff Bezos! On Friday, we flew to LA. 

On the day we arrived in LA, we went to Manhattan Beach and the Santa Monica pier. The next day, we took [[LSD]] at the beach in Malibu. 

Overall, this was a week of preparation for our LA trip, and then the first half of the trip. It was also really weird seeing Bezos and having the TikTok of us go viral. It really messed with [[Eylen]] and caused her a lot of anxiety. So that was a negative point of this week but overall I would say I did a lot of fun stuff.
