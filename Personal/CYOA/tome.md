# ðŸ“– Opening the tome
---
Unable to resist the lure of dark knowledge, you approach the book. As you look upon the ancient script, you feel... some sort of force within you. In your mind, you suddenly see so much! It's as if you were deaf and blind, and now you see it all!

You feel a power within you, coursing through your veins, a newfound strength and agility in every ounce of your being. 

Suddenly, the library door bursts open and three figures enter. Their leader, a grey-skinned, red-eyed creature, calls out to you.

"Human! I dont know how you got in here, but that doesnt matter now. You have gained high vampiric knowledge, as no mortal ever has. You must become one of us, or you will die in this chamber."

They raise their swords and await your response.
