# ðŸ“š The library
---
You finally scamble through the entrance into an unknown room, feeling a little more secure than you were out there. Looking around, it appears you have found yourself in some sort of library. Lit by red candlelight are rows and rows of dark books. It's deadly quiet as the smell of hundreds of ancient tomes fills your nose.

In the center of the chamber lies a marble pedestal with a huge leather bound book on top. Around this pedestal, a pentagram of candles lets off an otherworldly glow. Something tells you that if you were to step within that space, there would be no going back.
