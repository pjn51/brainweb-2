# ðŸšª Entering the castle 
---
Deciding against the climb, you enter the crack below the castle wall. You come into a dark room, and before your eyes adjust to the low light, you hear an eerie voice...

*"A visitor?"*

Out of the darkness comes a pale, thin figure with bloodshot eyes. He is holding a small dagger. You grip your sword, which suddenly feels a lot smaller in your grasp. In the back of the room, you see a possible escape route. You're thankful for the holy water you purchased. You feel it might come in handy.
