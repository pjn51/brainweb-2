The author begins by describing the situation of the [[USA|American]] economy in the 70s. He says that unemployment and [[inflation]] were on the rise, which mainstream [[economics|economic]] theory said was impossible. 

Booth says that the situation reveals that the [[bourgeoisie]] is willing to turn to the full powers of the [[state]] to prop up the economy, and embrace the theory of [[Keynesianism]], no matter the political leanings of the party in power at the time.

The article turns to the [[COVID-19]] [[economics|economic]] crisis, saying that over $16.5 trillion in state support has been implemented worldwide. He says that even the [[reformism|reformist]] leaders of the workers' movement have accepted Keynesianism. 

Booth argues that Keynesianism is designed not to free us from [[capitalism]]'s issues, but prop up a system in decline. 

# Liberalism and utopianism
Booth explains Keynes' social background as an elite [[academy|academic]] and representative of the [[bourgeoisie]], who openly said that his ideas and philosophical training were meant to protect him and his associates from the "virus" of Marxism. 

Booth notes that we can see clear tendencies towards [[idealism]] and utopianism in Keynes' thinking. 

# Class interests
Booth quotes from Keynes himself to confirm that Keynes held the [[proletariat|working class]] in contempt, saying that "the class war will find me on the side of the educated [[bourgeoisie]]."
