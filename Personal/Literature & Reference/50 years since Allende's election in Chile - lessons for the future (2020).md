The author begins by saying that September 4th, 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of the Popular Unity government assuming power in [[Chile]]. They were headed by Salvador [[Allende]]. He says that in 2020, the date will be marked by celebrations in a country shaken by the largest insurrectionary revolts in the post-Pinochet era. 

## Radical reforms
The author begins by walking us through some of the demands of Allende's party. He says that the party program contained radical measures, such as the [[economic planning|nationalization]] of many key industries, and deep agrarian reform moving the agricultural sector towards cooperative organization. 

Internationally, the author notes that the Popular Unity government stood in solidarity with [[Cuba]] and favored the construction of Latin American socialism.

## Imperialism and capitalism
The author explains that some of these reforms were achieved within the first three years of Allende's government. He says that the mines were nationalized, state control of foreign trade was implemented, among other landmarks. Above all, the author emphasizes that the working masses were mobilized through these reforms, and their confidence was bolstered.

The author explains that although Allende's party was represented Chilean [[reformism]], their ambitions were still too far-reaching to be compatible with the interests the forces of [[imperialism]], maninfested in the form of the [[USA]]. 

The author says that the hands of Nixon in the US were tied by the Vietnam War and the anti-war mood at home. However, the author explains that the Nixon administration, in allinace with the Chilean capitalists, did everything in their power to destabilize Chile. 

## Systematic sabotage
The author describes the counter-attacks waged by the right wing in Chile, with the help of the [[CIA]]. Inside the state, the author points to a right-wing legislative blockade, while the CIA funded a campaign of propaganda across the country. Economically, the author points to sabotage in the form of international boycott, capital flight, and withdrawl of consumer goods, leading to shortages. 

However, the author explains that the masses didn't take this lying down. He says that some elements of [[dual power]] began to appear, with housewives, the [[peasantry]], and workers forming committees to manage production. He elaborates that these committees appealed to Allende for state support in the form of arms and other aid, but the administration only gave them "kind words" in return.

## State and revolution
The author explains that in the 1973 elections, the vote for the Popular Unity party actually *increased* despite the campaign of propaganda against the government. The author claims that if Allende had relied on the tremendous strength of his working class support, no force could have stopped his party from carrying through the destruction of [[capitalism]] and [[state]]. In its place, he explains, the working class could have formed a new [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], based on the arming of the workers and the generalization of the elements of workers' power that had begun to organically emerge.

The author goes on to explain that in a fatal mistake, Allende continued to try and negotiate with the representatives of the Chilean [[bourgeoisie]] inside parliament. In the authors opinion, this simply gave time for the Chilean capitalists to prepare for a coup. 

The author explains that having failed to halt the revolution through parliament, and through economic strangulation, the capitalists and the imperialists turned to the reactionary generals. 

## Coup d'etat
The author explains that becuase of Allende's meekness, he allowed the imperalists to counter-attack in the form of a coup. He explains that jets manufactured in the [[UK]] bombed the presidential palace, killing Allende, while Pinochet took power. 

Since the workers were unarmed, the author explains that the military junta was able to crush all resistance to their neoliberal counter-reforms over the following seventeen years. 

Concluding the article, the author instructs us that as the workers in Chile and the world face a new epoch of revolution, we must remember the tragic example of the failed Chilean revolution of 1970-73.
