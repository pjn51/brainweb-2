# One
Engels argues that the working class movement and the ancient [[Christianity|Christian]] one have similarities. He says that they were both movements of the downtrodden that saw a path towards liberation - although the Christians saw it in an eternal afterlife while the socialsts see it on Earth ([[Marx and Engels - Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy (1959)]], p. 168). 

# Two
Engels counterposes the Christian movement before the Council of Nicea to the ossified and fixed ideology that came afterwards. He says that the early Christians were motivated by a feeling of struggle, and a willingess to fight that is now a characteristic of the socialist movement and no longer reflected in the Christians of the late 19th century (Ibid, p. 180). It's noteworthy that [[Nicea institutionalized Christianity]]. 

Engels also points out that much like the early Christian movement, the First International represented varied tendencies and ideas, from [[Bakunin]] and the [[Anarchism|Anarchists]], to [[Proudhon]] and his followers. He explains that it took 25 years for the Anarchists to detach from the International and general unity could be established (Ibid, p. 180).
