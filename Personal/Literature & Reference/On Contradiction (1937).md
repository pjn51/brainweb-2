# Review
This work of political theory by [[Mao]] is his explanation of contradiction and [[dialectics]]. I think that while his examples are interesting, they are interspersed with defenses of [[Stalin]] and the Soviet bureaucracy that feel out of place and somewhat shoehorned in. I think Mao bends the stick too far and seems to lose track of the material world a little bit. He totally glosses over how his support of the [[Kuomintang]] led to the deaths of thousands of communists, chalking that up to "oh well, dialectics means that allies can become enemies." It is a real mixed bag.

## The Two World Outlooks
Throughout human history, there have been two main outlooks on the development of society. 

The Marxist outlook of [[dialectical materialism]] arose out of the development of capitalism in Europe. 'Vulgar evolutionism' or the metaphysical mode of reasoning arose in opposition to this. 

This metaphysical mode thought that there were no observable changes in society. Exploitation always had existed, it was just a question of how much expoloitation, etc. This mode of thought denies the idea that contradictions within things are the reason for their [[evolution]], and says that the only way things change is through external forces.

> [!note]
> This seems like a weird combo between [[idealism]] and vulgar materialism. I'm not sure I'm following him here as to what the metaphysical mode is. Ok, I actually get it. The metaphysical mode is the opposite of dialectics, not of materialism.

Materialist dialectics holds that things change and move due to internal contradictions. Therefore, we should study things themselves and their relations to other things if we want to understand them. 

This does not ignore external causes, but recognizes that external forces are the immediate cause of change, but internal contradictions are the basis of change. "In a suitable temperature an egg changes into a chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into a chicken, because each has a different basis."

> [!note]
> Now I totally understand what he's saying here. External forces can act on something, but the thing the forces are acting on is the internal contradiction in something.

Because of this, the vanguard must focus its energy on making sure that the internal contradictions are kept under control. Otherwise, the strong external forces will rend the party on the basis of these contradictions.

## The Universality of Contradiction
Contradiction is universal, and is present in the development of all things. Even motion is itself a contradiction and contains competing forces that are diametrically opposed. 

These contradictions exist from the moment the object exists to the moment it ends, and then exist in whatever that object has become transformed into. 

> [!Criticism]
> Every time he mentions Stalin I cringe internally. I'm pretty sure Stalin did NOT advance the science of dialectics as much as Lenin or Marx did...
> 
> Seriously, this **book** is a contradiction lol. He is talking some sensible stuff, explaining dialectics nicely, and then he goes into how Stalin's USSR is doing so great, because they all understand this stuff too.
## The Particularity of Contradiction
While we must recognize the universality of contradiction, we still have to analyze the specific contradictions in relation to *one another*. 

Every society and stage of development has its own unique contradictions within it. 

There are two processes of cognition: from the specific to the general (taking evidence and making a generalization) and from the general to the specific (applying general laws to specific situations, improving the generalization). We must iterate between these two modes dialectically. Without one or the other, the scientific method breaks down.

> [!Criticism]
> Red flag: he says the contradiction between the colonies and [[imperialism]] is resolved through national revolutionary war. Ths seems debatable. But his main point, that different resolutions must be used to resolve different contradictions, is true.

It is only possible to find the resolution to a contradiction by looking at it objectively, from both sides.

> [!Criticism]
> Another interesting note is that Mao discusses the Kuomintang with little emphasis on how they basically massacred the working class of China and the cadres of the CPC in 1927. Actually he does emphasize how the contradictions in the KMT drove the org to switch sides a couple times, but he didn't really draw class independent lessons from that.

The status of being a universal contradiction and a particular contradiction are also fluctuating categories. Capitalism has contradictions that are today universal under capitalism, but since capitalism is only one stage of historical development, all its contradictions are particular ones. 

## The Principal Contradiction and the Principal Aspect of a Contradiction
Out of all the intersecting contradictions in a thing, there may be a principal contradiction that informs all the other resulting contradictions.

> [!question]
> Does there have to be a principal contradiction?

The principal contradiction may change if the balance of all contradictions shift. 

In the same way as there can be a single principal contradiction, one side of any contradiction may be the principal side of the contradiction, but that can also change. 

## The Identity and Struggle of the Aspects of a Contradiction
Now we turn to the way in which the two aspects of a contradiction interact with one another. 

The first way in which opposites are identical is that they depend upon one another for existance. There would be no above without a below. 

The second way is that the two sides of a contradiction switch sides at some point. The proletariat transforms from ruled to ruler, and the bourgeoisie does the opposite. 

While unity between opposites is conditional, temporary, and relative, the struggle between opposites is absolute. Without struggle, there can be no unity of opposites because opposites would never switch positions or depend upon one another, as everything would be static.

## The Place of Antagonism in Contradiction
Antagonism is but one form of struggle of opposites. 

> [!question]
> How is he defining antagonism? He says that only under heightened contradiction does the proletariat become antagonistic towards the bourgeoisie. I would say that open conflict is just a hightened state of class struggle, and that a new stage of antagonism doesn't exist, it's just a continuation of struggle.

> [!Criticism]
> Lol, he's talking about how Trotsky's fallacious thinking reflects the class struggle within the CP. He is correct, but he's got the interests mixed up! It was Stalin who was defending the interests of the bureaucracy, while Trotsky was representing the revolutionary energy of the proletariat.

Not every contradiction has to be an antagonistic one all the time. At low levels of tension, the contradiction can be non-antagonistic and is more easy to solve.  

## Conclusion
When we study the world, we must study contradictions. Pay special attention to the principal contradiction but keep in mind that it can change. 

We must keep in mind the universality and particularity of any given contradiction, and analyze both halves to have a clear picture of it. 

> [!Criticism]
> In general, I think Mao gives a good overview of the concept of dialectics, but over-emphasizes them in terms of revolutionary strategy. For example, he points out that the position of the national bourgeoisie was contradictory, as it was an enemy of both the proletariat and the imperialist ruling class, but he goes too far in claiming that they therefore ought to be allied with whenever they are more concerned with the imperialists. 
> 
> The issue with this is twofold. First, it is tactically difficult to tell when the national bourgeoisie will turn from an orientation against the imperialists to an orientation against local leftists. This means that it's very hard to predict when they will attempt to destroy you.
> 
> Secondly, allying with the national bourgeoisie may weaken your connection to the masses. This connection is the lifeblood of a revolutionary organization. The maintainance of this connection is far more important than any gains that might be available to you by allying with the national bourgeoisie against the imperialists. 
> 
> The only reason Mao really had to make this call was because the proletariat was so weak in China that the revolutionaries had to rely on the peasantry, and the peasantry alone wasn't enough to defeat the national bourgeoisie and the invading Japanese. However, conditions are now different. We have seen time and time again the immense power of the working class when it is unified. The best defense against *both* the national bourgeoisie and the forces of imperialism is to maintain class independence and organize the working class.
