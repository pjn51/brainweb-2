Lenin said that the question facing the Russian movement at this time was not a question of goal, but a question of what concrete steps must be taken along the chosen path. To him, the debate over this showed that there were still deep instabilities in the movement. 

One on hand, Lenin remarked that [[Economism]] wasn't yet dead and was causing a narrowing of political organization and agitation. On the other hand, he said that unprincipled eclecticism was confusing the movement. In his mind, this eclecticism failed to distinguish between immediate demands and the main goals of the movement. He said that these folks had a lot of spirit and sense of determination, but no real ideas on how to get anything done. 

Lenin said that the eclectics say that tactics must be changed on a dime as circumstances change on a dime. To him, they were correct, but the tactic that the eclectics wanted to be 'flexible' about was the development of a revolutionary organization in general, whereas Lenin viewed that as a totally basic starting point! Lenin said that there were no circumstances in which a revolutionary party would be a bad course of action.

>â€œChange the tactics within twenty-four hours!" But in order to change tactics it is first necessary to have tactics; without a strong organisation skilled in waging political struggle under all circumstances and at all times, there can be no question of that systematic plan of action, illumined by firm principles and steadfastly carried out, which alone is worthy of the name of tactics.

Lenin said that these eclectics brought up the question of [[terrorism]] as if it has never been posed before. He said that we cannot reject this tactic on principle, but we can only think about terrorism as a tactic of a larger organization conducting work as part of a larger plan, and within very specific conditions on the battlefield. 

When the question of terror was raised without an oganization, without a real plan, and without any strategy at all, Lenin said that terror would do nothing good. He said that it would divert the cadres from their most important tasks, and disorganizes the forces of revolution more than it disorganizes [[state]]. 

If the pursuit of terror caused the revolutionary [[vanguard]] to lose connection with the masses, as it probably would under the wrong conditions, Lenin said that it will have dealt a death blow to the revolution. 

Lenin said that the real mission for the vanguard in 1901 was not to assault the enemy, but to lay seige. He said that the party needed to be built to a level where it could support and direct the small bubbles of revolution as they sprung up. 

In Lenin's opinion, the practical form that this organization ought to have taken at the time was the formation of an all-Russian newspaper. He said that a regular publication would enable a revolutionary org to spread its influence far more widely than other activities let it do. 

Lenin pointed out that a newspaper also has the benefit of helping comrades to think about the big picture, and trains them in the art of writing for an audience. He said it was the skeletal structure that a strong [[cadre]] organization could be built around. 

Lenin remarked that this was not to say that the forces of class society can be toppled by repetitive, organized, party work. He said that class society was just as likely to be toppled by a totally spontaneous outburst of the masses or some complication like the ones that beset it on all sides. However, he said that we cannot base our work in waiting for some kind of black swan moment. Lenin said that we have to go our own way and carry on towards our goal step by step.
