> This is an article from *Socialist Revolution,* the US publication of the [[IMT]]

The authors begin by saying that in the last issue of SR, they published an article called "Building a Mass Socialist Party: Class Independence vs the 'Party Surrogate' Strategy." They argued that fighting for [[socialism]] requires strict [[class independence]] and an avoidance of the [[Democratic Party]] ballot line. 

The authors also argued that the [[DSA]] could dramatically advance the cause of socialism if they broke with the DNC and channeled their energy into independent socialist campaigns that "actually make a case for socialism as the center of their activity."

They say that they were delighted to recieve feedback from DSA members, who they say had a series of questions about the article. 

## Q: The IMT argues for a class-independent mass socialist party. What kind of party would this be? How do you define a "party"?
The authors begin by turning to the way that [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] answered this, which they claim is rather open ended. They say that these two figures were careful not to place excessive demands on the working class past fighting for their own interests. The authors think that Marx and Engels knew that any mistakes or failures were still a learning experience as long as they were steps towards *class independence*. 

To the authors, this meant the formation of parties that were *working class* in nature (meaning that the workers percieved them as *their* party, opposed to the parties of the bosses), and *mass* parties (meaning that they encompassed a large section of the working class). The authors quote [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]]: 

> The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties. They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own by which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.

The authors remind us that we cannot expect a fully-formed theoretical understanding of society from a newborn workers' party, and that the role of Marxists is to participate in the growth of the workers' movement and help explain the tasks and forces within and outside of the movement. 

## Q: Does this mean we should support [[reformism|reformist]] social-democratic and labor parties?
The authors reply that it means we must be a part of any mass working-class party and fight to change these institutions into revolutionary parties. They argue that only after an intensification of the class struggle will the working class draw revolutionary conclusions, and that in this situation, the workers' [[mass organizations]] would move towards a revolutionary potential. 

The authors note that even barring this prospect, the formation of a [[reformism|reformist]] mass [[workers' party]] would be positive, since it would allow workers to see themselves as a class with its own interests. 

Within this party, the authors explain, revolutionaries would compose a single current among many. It would be their role, according to the authors, to "develop a dialogue" with the rank-and-file in order to spread revolutionary ideas. 

## Q: How should a mass party operate within the context of capitalism? Should it pursue electoral victories and try to pass reforms?
The authors counterpose class-struggle politics and bourgeois politics. They say that the latter seeks election for its candidates as an end in itself, while the former views things differently. According to the authors, independent socialist campaigns should focus on "advancing the class struggle, not just winning elections" and should use the metric of whether an action prepares the working class to take power, recognize their own strength, or expose the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[state]]. 

The authors note that a mass party must offer a way forward in the day-to-day life of the workers. In order to do this, they say, we must incorporate transitional demands (see [[The Transitional Program (1938)]]) that expose the limits of [[capitalism]] and place the workers at the center of resolving the [[contradiction|contradictions]] through class-independent action rather than waiting for the bourgeoisie or the state to save them. 

The authors compare this approach to the "progressive" approach of some bourgeois politicians. They say that this group limits themselves to minor proposals, which don't involve any mobilization of the working class against the bosses. 

## Q: Would it have been possible for a mass socialist party to emerge in advance of the mass movements like the 2020 BLM uprising?
The authors answer that yes, if previous opportunities had been taken advantage of. They call our attention to 1996, when Tony Mazzocchi led the founding congress of a Labor Party that had endorsements from major [[unions]]. They criticize these efforts for failing to incorporate a class-struggle outlook, instead choosing to surrender to the Democratic Party for fear of splitting the vote. 

The authors claim that if this party had begun with a more healthy development, it could have taken advantage of the 2008 crisis and the wave of anti-Obama sentiment in 2010. Instead, they say, this discontent fueled the rise of the Tea Party and later [[Trump]]. 

## Q: Do you believe revolutionary change is possible in our lifetime?
The authors call attention to what they call the growing debate between revolutionary optimism and reformist pessimism. They argue that one the one hand, we see a massive wave of aspirations from the youth who seek a better life, with 39 million in the [[USA]] having a favorable opinion of [[Marxism]]. On the other hand, the authors point to the pessimism of left-liberals in the [[academy]] and the [[media]]. 

The authors say that in light of the waves of mass movements, revolutions, and strikes in recent years, it's clear that we're living through a revolutionary era today. They conclude that the best way to prepare for achieving socialism in our lifetime is the training of Marxist [[cadre]] and sinking deep roots into the [[proletariat]].
