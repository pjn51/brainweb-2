>This work of theory is one of the most important one [[Lenin]] ever wrote. At a time where the seizure of [[state]] power was immenent for the [[Bolsheviks]], it was critical that they develop a clear idea of the nature of the state, and the impossibility of seizing the pre-existing state of the [[bourgeoisie]] and using it for the construction of [[socialism]]. 
>
>This was written after the February Revolution toppled the Tsar, and the new Provisional Government emerged as a tool for the weak bourgeoisie in [[Russia]]. Forces like the [[Second International]] sought to work legally to gradually win control of the bourgeois state. 

# 1. Class Society and the State
## The State: A Product of the Irreconcilability of Class Antagonisms
Lenin says that after the death of revolutionaries, the [[bourgeoisie]] seeks to hallow the names of the dead, while blunting the revolutionary edge of their thought (Marxist Classics v.1, p.82). 

Lenin relies on Marx to argue that the state is a tool for the suppression of one class by another, far from the force that reconciles class antagonisms. In fact, he says, it developes out of the irreconcilability of these antagonisms. He argues that if these antagonisms *could* be reconciled, the state would wither away under capitalism (Ibid, p.83-84). He's saying that [[States are instruments of class domination]], and that [[The state cannot reconcile class antagonisms]]. 

Lenin argues that this demonstrates that the workers must not simply take hold of the state machinery of the capitalists, but must instead smash it and build their own state machine that is capable of serving their own interests (Ibid, p.85). I agree, [[The workers must build their own state]]. 

## Special Bodies of Armed Men, Prisons, etc.
Lenin contrasts the state with previous formations in human society. He says that this new force stands apart from society, and is needed because this body no longer represents the interests of the mass of society, in constrast with the "self-acting armed organization of the population" which is seen for all of human history . He also argues against the idea that the state, the police, and the army rose out of the growing complexity of society. Instead, he says, they grow out of the growing *class antagonisms and divisions* of society (Ibid, p.86). Basically, Class antagonism necessitates the state

## The State: an Instrument for the Exploitation of the Oppressed Class
As the state rises above society, the author continues, it requires taxes and loans to function. This creates one antagonism between the state and society. Lenin explains that unlike the tribal leaders, the state derives its authority from brute force rather then genuine respect, and the state totally lacks such respect as was given to tribal leaders, and in turn has much more power than those leaders ever did (Ibid, p.88). This is an interesting idea, that [[Tribal leadership authority was based on respect]]. 

The class character of the state is determined by whatever class is in a dominant position at the time the state is created. If a state arises during a period where two classes are nearly balanced in their power, the state can gain much more independence from both classes, acting against either side in order to halt the disintegration of society. This is the basics of [[Bonapartism]]. 

In a bourgeois democratic republic, “wealth exercises its power indirectly, but all the more surely.” The state and the ruling class enter an alliance, bound together by a thousand strings. Officials are corrupted directly, and the government passes pro-business policy and caters to the [[stock market]]. 

Lenin explains that despite being nominally more 'democratic,' [[Capitalists prefer liberal democracy]] as a political shell for capitalism. He quotes Engels, who says that in these countries, capital exercises its power "indirectly, but all the more surely" (Ibid, p.89)

A bourgeois democratic republic is the best possible shell for capitalism to inhabit. No change of state officials, or even whole parties can upset the power of wealth. 

In this context, universal suffrage is also a tool of bourgeois rule. It ties the masses to the state without giving them any real power to do as they please. The presence of universal suffrage can be used as a gauge of the maturity of the working class in defending itself. 

If the state arose because of the stratification of society, it would therefore fade away if this stratification into classes ceased. 

## The Withering Away of the State, and Violent Revolution
[[Engels]] says that the state will wither away. He does not mean that the bourgeois state will wither away, he means that after the workers seize the bourgeois state and abolish it as such, the state they will replace it with (a proletarian state) will wither away due to the eventual abolition of classes. 

The “special coercive force” of the bourgeois state will be replaced by a force that aims to suppress counter-revolution or invasion by foreign bourgeois representatives. 

A violent revolution will almost certainly have to take place in order to supersede the bourgeois form of state that we currently live under. 

Some took this to mean that there was no need for revolution, since the state would just slowly 'wither away.' Wrong! Engels means that the *proletarian* state will wither away after the revolution. The *bourgeois* state must be overthrown by the working class. 

Engels, and later Lenin, explain that the [[SPD]] slogan of a "free peoples' state" is unscientific, because it misunderstands the role of even a bourgeois democratic republic as a tool of class oppression. Marxists assert that no state can be free, and no state can act in the interest of all the people for long (or else it would begin to wither away). 

# 2. The Experience of 1848-51
## The Eve of Revolution
Lenin explains the development of Marx's ideas about the state, noting the influence of the revolutions of 1848. He argues that Marx defined the post-revolutionary state as "the proletariat organized as ruling class." Lenin believes that this definition of the state has been supressed by the Social Democratic trade unionists, because it's incompatible with gradualism and reformism (Ibid, p.99). [[Reformism isn't revolutionary]]. 

Lenin explains that [[States are instruments of class domination]], saying that the workers require their own state in order to dominate the bourgeoisie politically (Ibid, p.99). He's saying that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]]. 

Attacking the petty bourgeois democrats, Lenin says that they replace class struggle with dreams of peaceful submission of the bourgeoisie through the instrument of bourgeois democracy. He thinks that this idea is inseperable from the concept of states being above classes, as mediators of the class struggle rather than instruments weilded by the capitalists. He says that this led directly to multiple betrayals of the workers by these petty bourgeois democrats (Ibid, p.99). Again, [[Reformism isn't revolutionary]], and it can actually be counter-revolutionary in certain contexts.

Lenin notes that capitalism atomizes the petty bourgeois and the peasantry, but it welds together the proletariat. He argues that this makes the working class the truly revolutionary class that can defeat capitalism (Ibid, p.100). He's explaining how [[Capitalism organizes the working class]], and this is the central reason why [[Marxists orient towards the working class]] rather than other classes.

The author continues, saying that the Marxists play the role of teacher and guide to the workers' party, giving the [[vanguard]] the insight it needs to lead the working class to victory. In contrast, he says, the opportunist tendency is training the workers' party on how to serve the needs of the best paid workers and "sell their birthright for a mess of pottage" by capitulating to the demands of the capitalists (Ibid, p.100). 

## The Revolution Summed Up
Lenin explains that the bourgeois revolutionaries ended up perfecting the state machine for their own uses, but that the goal of the proletarian revolution would be a smashing of that state apparatus (Ibid, p.102). I agree that eventually, the workers' state would wither away, but we can clearly see that the Bolsheviks ended up reinforcing the Tsarist state machine in many ways. I think this reflects the fundamental failure of their efforts to overthrow class society. [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] rather than withering away. 

The author argues that the state, expressed in the bureaucracy and the military, is a parasite on society. He says that this is not only an [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] position, but also the autentic Marxist one that has been distorted by Kautsky (Ibid, p.103). 

Lenin says that the state wins over the upper layers of the petty bourgeois through giving their representatives cushy posts and good wages, serving to educate the broader working class as to who their real enemies are. 

For Lenin, the Communist Manifesto gets us almost all the way through the question of the state, but doesn't answer how the workers will actually replace the bourgeois state. He says that this question is answered later. 

Marx answers this by looking at the experience of the Paris Commune. [[France]] was a good case study during this time because it was the model feudal system, and this system was overthrown in the most dramatic bourgeois revolution. Therefore, the class divisions and political struggle were very clearly outlined. 

## The Presentation of the Question by Marx in 1852
Lenin states that to be a Marxist is to extend the class struggle to the recognition of the need for a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (Ibid, p.107). Lenin certainly places great importance on the fact that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]], and puts this position at the heart of Marxism. 

To Lenin, bourgeois states are varied in form, but identical in function: the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Proletarian states of the future, he continues, will likewise have various forms, but will all fundamentally be dictatorships of the proletariat. 

# 3. Experience of the Paris Commune of 1871, Marx's Analysis
## What made the communards attempt heroic?
Marx warned that this attempt would be folly but greeted their attempt enthusiastically. He thought the Paris Commune was so important, the Communist Manifesto needed to be revised to include it.

Lenin says that Marx clearly argued that the working class must break up the old state machinery rather than take hold of the bourgeois state (Ibid, p. 110). 

A people’s revolution is one in which the mass of the general public rises on its own legs and makes demands. In a society where the proletariat is not the majority of the people, a people’s revolution is distinct from a proletarian one. Since at this time, no country had a majority of proletarians, an alliance between proletarians and peasants was needed to secure a people’s revolution. The Paris Commune failed to reach such an alliance, and was therefore isolated and destroyed (Ibid, p. 112)

## What is to replace the smashed state machine?
Marx expected that the experience of revolution would provide answers as to what ought to replace the state.

The Paris Commune showed that an essential feature of this new organization would be the substitution of the armed people for a standing army (The SRs and Mensheviks refused to carry this out in Russia).

All positions of power became subject to universal election and recall at any time.

Lenin says that this is a case of quantity being transformed into quality, and that there was already some democracy under bourgeoisie rule, but the dramatic expansion of democracy changed the fundamental quality of the governmental organization from bourgeois to proletarian (Ibid, p. 114). 

Since it is still necessary to suppress counterrevolution, a repressive apparatus is still needed. However, this consists of the majority of the population, no longer an armed minority. By arming the whole of the population, a special suppressive force is no longer needed.

He explains that this expansion of democracy is possible because of how centralized and automatic the tasks of the state and industry have become. Lenin says that they could be performed by “every literate person” which is only a slight exaggeration (Ibid, p. 115). 

This new government would also be much cheaper, as the largest state expenditure is of course the military. 

## Abolition of parliamentarism
Marx said the Commune was to be a working body, both executive and legislative at the same time. Just as an employer can hire and fire at will and at any time, so should the people be able to elect and recall their representatives at all levels. 

Lenin criticizes bourgeois democracy, saying that it merely represents the oppressed choosing the representative of the oppressors who will rule over them. He argues that the way forward is the conversion of the "talking shops" of bourgeois parliaments into working bodies that would be responsible for enacting their plans. He argues that this is quite different from the bourgeois method, where the real business of state is done behind the scenes by the executive (Ibid, p. 117). 

The new officials of this government will be the foremen, accountants, and workers under the direction of the whole of society. 

## Organization of national unity
The Paris Commune was intended to expand to a national system of communes which would elect a national delegation in Paris. The functions that were best left to the central government would be performed by functionaries elected by this delegation.

Many confused this concept with bourgeois federalism. Marx was a centralist at heart. He wanted the ownership of all industry and land to be held centrally by the whole of the people, not for each township to own its region.

## Abolition of the parasitic state
We reject the utopian idea of discovering the perfect political structure, as well as the anarchist rejection of all structures, and the opportunist acceptance of bourgeois political structures.

Marx said that the state would disappear, and the transitional stage would be the proletariat organized as the ruling class. He did not go any further into detail about what precise form this transition would take. 

The experience of the Paris Commune revealed a possible format for this organic transition (and this was later confirmed by the Soviets of the Russian Rev. of 1917).

# 4. Supplementary Explanations by Engels
## The housing question
Lenin cites Engels, who explains that the people *in whole* would be the owners of property, and therefore ground rent would not be immediately abolished, but lowered and given to the workers' state instead of individual landlords, so that repairs could be paid for and the surplus could be put towards the general economic plan (Ibid, p. 127). 

## Controversy with the anarchists
Lenin confirms that Marxists agree with Anarchists about the need for state abolition, but diasgree as to the timeline and order of events. He argues that it is necessary to weild state power against the capitalists in order to secure the revolution (Ibid, p. 129). 

He quotes Engels, who says that state functions will lose their political character after the abolition of classes, and become administrative functions instead (Ibid, p. 130). 

> A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is...and the victorious party must maintain their rule by means of the terror which it's arms inspire in the reactionaries (Ibid, p. 130). 

## Letter to Bebel
A “free state” vs “free people’s state” was an argument with anarchists. A “free state” is a state that is free to do whatever it wants, basically a despotic state. This idea is way too idealistic and vague, so we shouldn’t advocate for some kind of special state that would be amazing, we should aim to create a world in which a state is no longer needed.

The SocDems had long since abandoned the Marxist position on the withering away of the state, and accused the Bolsheviks of anarchism! This was false. 

The SocDems envisioned a utopian version of the state that would be wonderful and could preside over a fantastic, serene society. Marxists know that the state has always been, and will always be a tool of organized force, and therefore the worst feature of human society. Even under the dicatorship of the proletariat, the state is a necessary evil, and we welcome its demise once it isn't needed. 

Bebel said that the goal was to create a state not based on class domination, but in fact Marxists should aim to create a state of domination by the proletariat over the bourgeoisie.  

## Criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Program
The Erfurt Program of the German Social Democrats was put forward. It had a lot of opportunism and [[reformism]] in it, and the SocDems were afraid to criticize the German state because they wanted to remain a legal party in parliament.

Lenin cites Engels analysis of monopoly capitalism, arguing that this is a discussion of [[imperialism]]. However, he argues that this is *not* socialism, since no matter how well planned capitalist firms are, that doesn't constitute a socialist economy, and should only be used as an example of the feasibility of such an economy (Ibid, p. 135). 

Lenin quotes Marx who argued against the need for a federal system in Germany at the time. According to Lenin, Marx thought that centralism was better, as long as it was a workers' state, and that federalism isn't a single step towards real autonomy since it's bourgeois federalism (Ibid, p. 138). 

The Erfurt Program refuesed to call for a republic in Germany, since they were worried about being banned again. However, a republic would have been a great improvement. A democratic republic provides the easiest path towards the proletarian dictatorship, because it intensifies the class struggle and puts it into the open. When the government supposedly represents your interests, and when there is a so-called workers' party that is unable to do so due to the bourgeois state apparatus, the working class sees the need for proletarian dictatorship more clearly. 

The German Social Democrats dominated The Second International, and reformism began to seep into the movement. Engels criticized this while it was happening, and Lenin criticized it after the fact. 

## The 1891 preface to Marx's "The Civil War in France"
Discussing the question of religion within the Social Democratic movement in passing, Lenin argues that Engels very specifically said that religion should be a private matter *in regards to the state,* and not in regards to the workers' party. According to Lenin, the workers' movement must struggle to preserve the conscious element which is choked by religion (Ibid, p. 142). 

Back to the nature of the workers' state, Lenin explains that the positions of influence must not provide a higher standing, to avoid careerism, and must be simplified so that as many can participate as possible (Ibid, p. 143). 

## Engels on the overcoming of democracy
Engels said "social democrat" was imprecise because we ought to dissolve the state, meaning a dissolution of democracy as well. 

Even democracy is a state in which the majority dominates the minority. Without classes to dominate / be dominated, there is no need for a democratic state.

# 5. The Economic Basis for the Withering Away of the State
## Presentation of the question by Marx
Lenin defends Marx and Engels from those who say they had differing ideas about the state. Lenin argues that these two thinkers are united in their conception. He says that the method that Marx employed was a dialectical one, concerned with development rather than isolated structures of society (Ibid, p.150). 

Lenin quotes Marx from [[Critique of the Gotha Program (1875)]], where Marx argues that while states are different according to national quirks and levels of development, we can speak of their unifying characteristics - and we have to do so scientifically, rather than just proposing a "peoples' state" in the abstract, like the Gotha Program did (Ibid, p. 150). 

## The transition from capitalism to communism
Lenin criticizes bourgeois democracy, saying that even under the most ideal circumstances, when democracy is extended to most workers, it's still hemmed in by the limits of capitalism. He says that "freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slave-master" (Ibid, p.152). [[Bourgeois democracy is limited]]. 

Supporting this claim, Lenin says that the various restrictions on participation, which seem trivial to the bourgeoisie, in aggregate, limit the engagement of the average worker in the political system, weighting the electoral system in favor of the rich (Ibid, p. 152). 

Fighting back against reformists who said that a gradual widening of democracy was the way forward, Lenin counters that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the only way to break the resistance of the capitalists (Ibid, p. 153). [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]]. 

After their resistance is broken, Lenin predicts, we can finally speak of real freedom, when a special machine of repression will no longer be needed (Ibid, p. 154). 

However, he reminds us that during the transition to a communist society, supression will still be needed to ensure the domination of the workers. This means, he continues, that a state apparatus will be needed, but rather than the oppression of the majority, it will undertake the repression of the minority, and will therefore be smaller in scope (Ibid, p. 155). He's arguing that [[The workers' state is a semi-state]]. In contrast, [[Trotsky envisioned a ruthless workers' state]]. 

## The first phase of communist society
Lenin cites Marx's explanation of the lower stage of communism, commonly called socialism. He argues that Marx envisioned this stage eradicating exploitation in the process of production, but recognized the inability to immediately erase inequality of distribution. Recognizing this, the author continues, Marx understood that the workers' state must continue to uphold bourgeois law for a time (Ibid, p. 157). 

## The higher phase of communist society
Continuing, he notes that Marx described the higher stage of communism as eradicating the distinction between manual and mental labor, and finally arriving at the ability to abolish bourgeois law itself, embracing the slogan of "from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs" (Ibid, p. 159). 

> So long as the state exists there is no freedom. When there is freedom, there will be no state (Ibid, p. 159)

Arguing agains those who label communists as utopians, Lenin says that until the higher phase of communism, there will be *strict* control over production and distribution by the armed workers, and only when strict discipline becomes second-nature can the workers' state be done away with (Ibid, p. 160). Maybe Lenin's idea of the workers' state isn't as far from Trotsky's as I thought. 

Lenin defines the lower phase of communism scientifically. He says that in the first phase, society cannot fully free itself from the vestiges of capitalism, and must enforce bourgeois law in regards to distribution of goods. He says that this implies the existence of a *bourgeois state,* and says that this will be a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie (Ibid, p. 161-162). 

Now, Lenin turns to a discussion of the progressive aspects of democracy, but also its limitations. he says that while democracy has welded together the oppressed and allowed them a path towards overthrowing their rulers and administrating society through a democratic workers' state, it is still a form of state itself and brings with it an oppressive apparatus. Because of this, he says, under communism even democracy itself will wither away as a formal system, as we become accustomed to operating in an informal democratic method (Ibid, p. 162). 

Closing out the chapter, Lenin argues that the main tasks of the workers' state are accounting and control of production and distribution. He says that capitalism has simplified these tasks, and educated the workers, such that more and more are capable of serving in these positions (Ibid, p. 163). 

# 6. The Vulgarization of Marxism by Opportunists
## Plekhanov’s Controversy with the Anarchists
[[Plekhanov]] wrote a pamphlet on the relation of anarchism to socialism. However, he avoided the issue of the state. 

Anarchists tried to claim the Paris Commune as their own, failing to see what lessons Marx drew from it in relation to the state. 

To talk about anarchism and socialism without including an analysis of the state is opportunist. 

## Kautsky’s Controversy with the Opportunists
Kautsky is known for his controversy with Bernstein and other opportunists. He later drifted into “social-chauvinism” during the 1914-15 crisis, where he supported Germany in the war.

His hesitation to commit to a definitively revolutionary line can be seen in earlier works and letters. He also fails to criticize Bernstein in the correct way, or to the full extent of Bernstein’s distortion of Marx when it comes to the state.

## Kautsky’s Controversy with Pannekoek
Pannekoek was a radical left critic of Kautsky. 

Anarchists don’t understand the basis for the state in class society, and therefore want to get rid of it before classes are abolished. They are very vague about what would replace the state. 

Kautsky seeks to remove all traces of revolution from Marx, relegating the whole movement to that of an opposition party. He and those like him are terrified to break irrevocably with the bourgeoisie.
