*This is a blog post by Paul Cockshott, dealing with the implications of eliminating concrete and steel as building materials.*

The author begins by presenting an overview of the process by which carbon is released in the production process of building materials, namely bricks and steel. 

For the production of steel, the carbon emissions come in the form of fuel for the furnace. Since we produce too much steel to use wood in a sustainable way, we must use coal or another resource like that. 

The author points to the fact that the [[UK]] produces 12 million tons of steel annually. This involves around 30 million tons of carbon. If using dry wood for fuel, the industry would consumen 90 million tons of wood annually. This is an issue because 8 million hectare of forest would be needed to do this sustainably, while there is only 3 million in the UK available. 

Another possibility that the author discusses is the switching to a new method of steel creation. It's possible to use electrical energy to produce steel, at the cost of over 3000KWh per ton of steel. This could be achieved by creating a few more power plants.
