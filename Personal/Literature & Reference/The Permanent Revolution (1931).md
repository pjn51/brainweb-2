## Introduction to the Russian edition
Trotsky begins by saying that in the 20s and 30s, a group of other former Bolsheviks who had since sided with [[Stalin]] and the bureaucracy were targeting Trotsky and the theory of [[permanent revolution]]. 

Trotsky criticizes his opponents' efforts to characterize themselves as the "old guard [[Bolsheviks]]" opposed to the forces of [[Trotskyism]], by saying that the events of 1917 were the fundamental test of all these figueres. He argues that all his current enemies, [[Bukharin]], [[Zinoviev]], and [[Stalin]], failed this test and played the role of "democratic Left Wingers."

Trotsky asserts that all these figures, during 1917, considered the idea of a socialist revolution to be out of reach, and that it was only the arrival of [[Lenin]] in April that righted the course of the party. 

He elaborates that before 1905, all the left agreed that the coming revolution was to be bourgeois-democratic in nature. However, Trotsky says that nobody could agree on what classes needed to carry out the revolution, and what the relationship between those classes would be.

According to Trotsky, [[Plekhanov]], [[Martov]], and the other [[Mensheviks]] believed that the liberal [[bourgeoisie]] would have the natural leading role in the coming bourgeois revolution. Under this schema, he continues, the Mensheviks thought that the [[proletariat]] would play the role of the left wing of the democratic coalition. According to him, this meant that the [[reformism|Social Democrats]] must support the liberal bourgeoisie against the monarchy while defending the interests of the proletariat againast this bourgeoisie.

Trotsky counterposes this with what he says Lenin's view was. Trotsky says Lenin viewed this in a totally different manner, through the lens of the agrarian question and the real tasks of a 'bourgeois revolution.' The author continues, saying that the liberation of the productive forces from serfdom signified a radical redistribution of land from the aristocracy to the [[peasantry]], and the total destruction of the monarchy. 

Trotsky asserts that Lenin understood that since the liberal bourgeoisie was "intimately bound by innumerable ties to large landed property, the genune democratic liberation of the peasantry can be realised only by the revolutionary co-operation of the workers and peasants." This is the reasoning Trotsky believes is behind Lenin's support of the slogan: "The democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants."

> [!note]
> This is a key assertion. I know that Lenin did arrive at the same view as Trotsky just before October 1917, but I would like to read more of Lenin's writings on this subject. 

Trotsky laments that this slogan is now repeated in the [[Comintern]] as a "supra-historical dogma," removed from its context. Trotsky points out that there actually has never been a historical example of a democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants existing. 

Rewinding to 1905, Trotsky tells us that this slogan was a strategic hypothesis that was yet to be validated by the course of events. The author says that Lenin did not wish to exclude the possibility that the peasantry could play an independent role and be represented by a political party of their own that would govern in coalition with a [[workers' party]]. 

Trotsky notes that while he was a student of Lenin for a long time during this period, he disagreed with this formulation. He thought that it was too vauge about which class would really be exerting its will at the head of the dictatorship, and thought that historical example proved that the peasantry does not play an independent political role for long. He cites the German Reformation of the 1500s and the many peasant uprisings before that. Because of this, Trotsky concluded that the tasks of the bourgeois revolution could only be accomplished if the proletariat, *with the aid of the peasantry,* established its dictatorship. 

Trotsky believes that this dictatorship must solve the agrarian question and establish a democratic [[state]] apparatus. He says that in other words, this meant that the proletariat would have to accomplish the tasks of the bourgeois revolution. He also thought that the proletariat would be compelled to continue the revolution and "encroach even more deeply upon the relationships of private property in general, ...to take the road of socialist measures."

Trotsky says that Stalin, Rykov, Molotov, and those like them had similar objections to this idea: that [[Russia]] was not ripe for socialism. He answers that he agrees Russia is not yet ready, but that the world as a whole is ready. 

> Whether the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in Russia leads to socialism or not, and at what tempo and through what stages, will depend upon the fate of European and world capitalism.

Trotsky says that the above arguments are the essential features of his theory of permanent revolution that he established in 1905, but that since then, three revolutions in Russia have taken place, which confirmed the correctness of his ideas.

No sooner than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] became a reality, Trotsky says, did the "epigonies" (definition: a less distinguished follower or imitator) begin to attack the theory which so accurately described the course of the revolution.

==Stopping point:== 
> It is appropriate to recall here that the first Russian revolution broke out more than half a century after the wave of bourgeois revolutions in Europe and thirty-five years after the episodic uprising of the Paris Commune.
