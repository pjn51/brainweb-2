# Review
This is a science fiction novel by renowned author Ursula LeGuin, dealing with a protagonist who travels from one civilization to another, in search of scientific knowledge. 

The protagonist was born into a world that is basically a utopia in the vision of [[Anarchism]]. There is no [[state]], and no private ownership of anything. 

This book is really interesting for the way in which the author describes this Anarchist society. It suffers from [[idealism]], but I found it a compelling description of what [[communism]] might look like, albeit with a much higher technological level than the society described in the book. 

I also appreciate the scientific bent of the characters. The protagonist is a physicist, which adds an interesting motive for his interplanetary trek.
