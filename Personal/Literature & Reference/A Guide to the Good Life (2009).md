# Review 
This book, by William Irvine, is a modern reading of [[Stoicism]] with an emphasis on useful techniques for improving our lives. I like how this book is really down to earth and outlines practices from Stoicism that are actually useful to us, following in the footsteps of the Stoics who always grounded their insights in the practice of actual life.
