> Das Kapital, or Capital, is Marx's most famous work of political economy. 

In the preface, the author explains how [[Marx inverted Hegel's dialectic]] ([[Marx and Engels - Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy (1959)]], p.145). 

# Part 1: commodities and money
## Chapter 1: commodities
Marx begins by examining why we should study the nature of [[commodities]]. Since [[capitalism]] represents its wealth as "an immense accumulation of commodities," that's where our investigation must begin. 

Marx defines a commodity as an object outside of us, whose properties satisfies human wants in some subjective way. With this definition, we aren't concerened with why it satisfied these wants or where these wants arise from. 

Marx turns to the idea of quantity and quality. We can view any commodity through the lens of these two variables. Since commodities are "an assemblage of many properties," a commodity could be useful in many ways, and Marx says that it is the job of history to discover new uses for objects. It is also the job of history to create standards of measure of quantity. 

Discussing [[use value]], Marx says that this property comes from the utility of a thing. It has no existance seperate from the thing itself, and the use-value of something is *independent* of the amount of labor requried to access the useful quality of the thing. Use-values become a reality only upon the consumption of that commodity, and ultimately use-value constitutes the substance of all wealth. Marx calls use-value the "material depositories" of exchange value. 

On the other hand, Marx says, we can discuss [[exchange value]]. At first glance, this value presents itself as purely a function of use value, an exchange rate for use value, dependent on time and place. 

Marx encourages us to study this value more closely. He imagines a bushel of wheat as an example. This wheat is exchangeable with $x$ amount of coal, $y$ amount of steel, etc. Therefore, it seems that there are many exchange values for each commodity. But Marx says that since these commodities are exchangeable with each other, by the transitive property there is only a single exchange value for each commodity. 

To Marx, this fact means that exchange value of one commodity for another is just a surface-level *representation* of some deeper quality that a commodity has. If we can exchange $x$ coal for $y$ steel, that means that both of these commodities, in these quantities, contain an equal amount of some quality. Therefore, Marx explains, these two things must contain a third property, which is shared between them. 

Marx turns to a geometrical explanation. In order to calculate the areas of rectilinear figures, we can decompose them into triangles. Even though we calculate the area of a triangle differntly than we would for another shape, we can use this decomposition to find the area of the overall figure. 

Marx says that this common "something" can't be any material property of the item in question, because commodities of extremely diverse characteristics can all be reducible to this "something." Therefore, this exchange value cannot be related to use-value. In terms of use-value, commodities are of different *qualities,* but in terms of exchange values, commodities simply exist as different *quantities.*

Marx provides a quote to illustrate this point:

> ...one sort of wares are as good as another, if the values be equal. There is no difference or distinction in things of equal value... An hundred pounds' worth of lead or iron, is of as great value as one hundred pounds' worth of silver or gold.
> -- Barbon

So if we totally leave out the idea of use-value, Marx continues, these commodities only have one common property left: they are all the products of *labor*! By finding the characteristic that unites *all* commodities and makes them exchangeable, we see that the only possible characteristic is abstract human labor.

## Chapter 10: the working day
### Section 5
Explaining the behavior of individual investors / capitalists, Marx says that "in every stock-jobbing swindle everyone knows that sometime or other the crash must come, but everyone hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbor, after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety" (Ibid, p.151). A classic example of how [[Individual rationality can lead to collectively irrational results]] and [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]]. 

Marx argues that the worker under capitalism is compelled to sell "his birthright for a mess of pottage," i.e. that workers are forced to give up their ability to truly live in order to afford the necessities of life (Ibid, p.153). This has a lot to do with the idea that [[Capitalism is alienating]]. 

...

### Section 7
> In the United States of North America, every independent movement of the workers was paralyzed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the republic. Labor cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black skin it is branded (Ibid, p.158).

The above quotation is in support of the idea that [[Racism has divided the working class]] against itself.

## 26. The secret of primitive accumulation
Marx explains that [[primitive accumulation]] of capital was reflected in the separation of the producers from the means of production. He says that this had a progessive character in the emancipation of the serfs, which the bourgeois historians focus on, and a negative character in the newly-freed serfs enslavement into the wage labor system (Ibid, p. 162). 

...

## 32. Historical tendency of capitalist accumulation
Marx argues that the historical development of capitalism centralizes capital in the hands of fewer and fewer capitalists, while at the same time increasing the strength and broadening the size of the working class, all while raising the technical level of production (Ibid, p. 166). [[Capitalism organizes the working class]] due to the centralization of capital.

Furthermore, he explains that the violent process by which individual property was transformed into capitalist property is incomparably more painful than the process by which it could be converted into social property : 

> The transformation of scattered private property, arising from individual labor, into capitalist private property is, naturally, a process incomparably more protracted, violent, and difficult than the transformation of capitalistic private property already practically resting on socialized production, into socialized property. In the former case we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few usurpers; in the latter we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the people (Ibid, p. 167).
