 Grant begins by outlining the need to re-examine and analyze the tactics and strategy of the workers' movement at various times. He states that this is for the benefit of new members, and to refresh older ones. He turns to an analysis of the conditions of work in the [[UK]]. 

Referring to some splinter groups as tinged with [[sectarianism]], he says that these folks have a very simple outlook - that Social Democracy and [[Stalinism]] have betrayed the workers, and therefore a new working class party must be built. He says that these sectarians "claim the independence of the revolutionary party as a principle, whether the party consists of two or two million."

Grant accuses these people of failing to take the actual state of the movement into account, a process which he says "conditions the tactics, while maintaining the principles of the [[Marxism|Marxists]]." Grant believes that without flexible tactics we won't be able to win or train the forces needed to found a revolutionary party.

Grant notes that unfortunately the development of such forces is not a straightforward affair. He says that if it is, then all we would need to do is proclaim the advantages of [[socialism]] over [[capitalism]], and announce the formation of a workers' party.

Grant asserts that we must study the working class movement as it truly developed, with the objective material factors on one hand, and the subjective factors of leadership on the other hand. He says that the basic task of the late 20th century was to overcome the weakness and isolation of the movement while maintaining revolutionary principles. 

Grant dives into a history of the [[Comintern]], saying that it was created as a result of the betrayal of the workers by Social Democracy in 1914-1920. Then, Grant argues that after the October revolution degenerated and [[Stalinism]] took root, the ComIntern changed from an organ of world revolution to the opposite, until the ComIntern lost its ability to act in a revolutionary way after the failure to defeat [[Hitler]], and the telling inability to learn from that event.

At this point, Grant says, the Left Opposition declared the formation of new revolutionary parties and the [[Fourth International]]. However, Grant reminds us that there's a wide gulf between the ability to declare a new formation and the ability to create one with a mass basis. 

Under the conditions of being thrown back, Grant says, [[Trotsky]] first posed the question of [[entryism]]. Grant says that it's significant that Trotsky posed this question in a British context.

Grant turns to a brief history of entryism in the UK. He outlines how the government of the [[Labour Party (UK)]] between 1929 and 1931 shattered faith in [[reformism]], and how this shift led to the formation of the Independent Labour Party, or ILP. 

Grant asserts that the ILP split from the LP on the wrong issue, at the wrong time, and without mobilizing the base of the party to split with them. According to Grant, this meant that tens of thousands of workers were moving in the direction of [[Marxism]], but their ideas were confused and muddled. Grant says they could have been won to a revolutionary program, [[reformism]], Stalinism, or apathy.

At this point, Grant tells us, the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] in the UK had been expelled from the Communist Party (in 1932). Grant says that Trotsky suggested that these isolated revolutionaries orient to the leftward-moving workers of the ILP. However, Grant says most resisted this and only made modest successes until the ILP faded away due to a confused leadership.

By 1935, Grant continues, the Labour Party had won back a lot of support, and Trotsky suggested entery work in the LP directly. Grant says that the class struggle in Britain made the advanced workers receptive to revolutionary ideas, but these workers wouldn't listen to "a tiny organization outside the mainstream of the Labour Movement." To Grant, the main goal was to penetrate the workers' movement and make contact with the most politically advanced members. 

Grant believes that the LP represented the "political expression of the organized trade union movement" and therefore the task was to "learn to express revolutionary ideas in a language workers would understand, skillfully fighting the Reformists step by step, but without abandoning revolutionary ideas or perspectives" inside the [[mass organizations]] of the working class. 

Grant says that the working class doesn't test out revolutionary ideas before trying every easier solution first, and this means that at the first stage of upheaval, the workers will turn to their traditional mass organizations to find a straightforward solution to their problems. [[Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis]]. 

Giving the example of the failed revolution in [[Germany]], Grant points to the fact that the [[Spartacists]] represented tens of thousands of advanced workers, but that the masses still turned to the treacherous [[SPD]] first to try and solve their problems, even as the leaders in the SPD betrayed the movement time and time again.

Grant asserts that the main tactical consideration was to convert a handful of revolutionaries into an integrated group that was connected to the working class, and then into a [[cadre]] organization, and then into a wider grouping, and then into a mass organization. 

However, Grant says we ought not to make a fetish out of entryism. He says that during [[WW2]], the LP was in coalition with the [[bourgeoisie]], and the youth were in the armed forces. To him, this meant that the LP declined as an organ of the working class, and meant that there were opportunities for independent work. He says that such work was successful.

After the war, Grant says that reformism and stalinism were strengthened by a whole range of factors. He says that this was reflected in the Labour victory in the UK in 1945.

Grant analyzes that this new Labour government had little in common with the last crisis-ridden one. He says that the ruling class had lost confidence in British industry, and had been devastated by the war. Because of this, Grant tells us, the capitalists were unable to mount a defense against efforts to [[economic planning|nationalize]] under-performing British industries. He says this is also why the British colonies were ceded to their national bourgeoisie. 

Grant argues that the Labour government was able to implement concessions to the workers due to the rapid influx of [[capital]] after the war, leading to a rise in profits for business. He notes that some of this was due to the [[USA]] underwriting the Labour government through the Marshall Plan. 

As a result of all of this, Grant remarks that illusions in reformism were bolstered among the workers, leading to the isolation of the revolutionary tendency. Grant also says that during this time, the conditions for entryism did *not* exist. He outlines these conditions:

1. Pre-revolutionary or revolutionary situation
2. Ferment in Social Democracy
3. Development of a Left Wing
4. The possibility of the rapid crystallisation of the revolutionary tendency. 

Grant describes the [[ultraleftism]] of the Healyites in the Revolutionary Communist Party who said that the issue in 1950 was socialism or [[fascism]] within a year, and therefore advocated for entryism. 

Nevertheless, Grant says that once the Trotskyists had entered the Labour Party, the perspective of how to operate within it was critical. He highlights that the our own forces are far too weak to create a left wing, and should focus in developing cadres within the Party, as well as gaining positions within the Labour Party leadership. 

However, Grant underlines that to "dress ourselves in the clothes of Left Reformism over a period" would be a giant mistake, as demonstrated by the Healyites. 

Grant says that while conditions for entryism are still not present (1959), it would be a mistake to begin independent work after a decade within the Labour Party since conditions outside the LP are also not favorable. He says that whatever gains could have been made by staying independent are small in comparison to the gains from maintaining influence within the Labour Party. 

Grant explains that to begin independent work would also make returning to the Labour Party more difficult, as re-entry would be blocked and Trotskyists would be barred. 

> [!question]
> This seems like a muddled point. If conditions for entryism are not present, but you're pursuing entryism anyway, shouldn't we either revise the conditions for entryism or stop doing it?
> 
> If re-entry is impossible during conditions of ferment, aren't the general conditions for entryism useless?

Grant asserts that if the Trotskyists were independent, at that time they would be preparing for entry into the Labour Party, and it's therefore a terrible idea to try and leave the Labour Party at that time. 

Furthermore, Grant says that these constant changes in direction tend to demoralize the members, and revealed that the Healyites were operating only on the basis of empricism. 

> To attempt to shout louder than oneâ€™s voice merely results in hoarseness and ultimately the loss of voice altogether. We have to establish ourselves as a tendency in the Labour Movement.

Grant says that [[opportunism]] and [[adventurism]] are two sides of the same coin. He says that they both rise out of a false assesment of the immediate condtions, or out of a surrender to the immediate conditions. 

Turning back to the LP, Grant explains that the leadership has developed an advanced machine for the detection of infiltrators, with a decade of experience in fighting Trotskyists. 

Grant outlines his perspective that the next Labour government would be more crisis-ridden than the last, and that a revolutionary tendency within the LP would be very valuable as the workers move to the left after seeing the inadequacy of reformism. 

On the other hand, Grant says that if the Tories win, the Trotskyists will be in a good position to take advantage of the extra-parliamentary struggles that will occur. He says that in this situation, the [[unions]] and the LP will be forced to swing to the left in preparation for battle. 

Grant argues that the pressure of the class struggle accelerates the political development of the workers, and puts all the programs of all the parties to the test. [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]]. 

In conclusion, Grant writes that the most important thing for a revolutionary is a sense of proportion. He proclaims that we have to pursue the theoretical education of our own forces at the same time as we make advances within the Labour Party, because either one on its own would be inadequate "if we are to fulfull the role laid on us by history."
