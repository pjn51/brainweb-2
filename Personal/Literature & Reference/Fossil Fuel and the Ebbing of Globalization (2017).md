The author begins with an explanation of an analysis of change based on [[materialism]]. The author asserts that this means we have to begin our analysis with the contradictions that actually exist between our "technological imperatives" and the social forms that currently exist. 

The author claims that we must look beyond the fossil fuel economy towards alternatives from this starting point. Since almost 90% of world primary energy comes from fossil fuels, this is a daunting task. 

The author claims that nuclear and hydro are the only currently mature alternative energy sources, and that solar and wind are rapidly maturing, but that all of these sources have their issues. Based on my memories of school, I would agree with this broad assesment. 

The author asserts that carbon capture technology is not very matured at all. He contrasts the experience we have in operating nuclear power plants with the limited [[data]] we have on operating full-scale carbon capture plants.

The author asks an interesting question:

> Marx claimed that the stage of development of technology is what ultimately determines the bounds on social relations. He believed that communism was the likely future of industrial society and that coal powered steam engines were the foundation of capitalist economy. Is there anything about the transition anything about the transition to a post fossil fuel economy that would favour communism over capitalism?

The author brings up the [[Russia|USSR]], saying that it heavily depended on large scale integrated production for energy. He also notes that the economic regression following the reversion to [[capitalism]] demonstrates that capitalism was incapable of maintaining such a system's benefits. He notes that the one industry that improved after the reversion was fossil fuel extraction.

The author brings up the fact that the USSR had many long-term plans for the energy sector. These relied heavily on nuclear, and had orbiting solar power stations as a long-term goal. The author asserts that these are post-capitalist forms of energy production, in the sense that they would only be possible in places like the USSR. 

The idea for the orbital solar station has been around since the 70s. They benefit from avoiding the day night cycle, and could theoretically beam enerfy to Earth in the form of microwaves. 

From these facts, the author hypothesizes that the energetic basis of [[communism]] would be these orbiting solar stations as well as huge "tokamaks" (thermonuclear reactors) able to supply endless energy from deuterium in seawater. The author says that these technologies don't enjoy much funding right now due to the huge initial investment, and the [[capital]] intensity. High [[capital]] intensity is associated with low profitability, detering private firms. 

The author notes that the cost of thermonuclear reactors are so large that multiple states have to come together to invest in them. The first thermonuclear reactor ITER is being built in [[France]] with investment from 35 countries. Construction will be finished in 2025, and it will be the largest and most complex machine ever created. The plant is scheculed to begin operations in 2035. 

The author contrasts these technologies with that of solar and wind power. The latter two can be created with less initial investment, and can be done in a piecemeal way. The author asserts that if these technologies form the basis for future civilization, there will be no force acting against private ownership in the energetic basis of society. 

However, the author points out that solar and wind cannot form the basis for a hyper-individualistic society as some have envisioned. Those without the [[capital]] and space to afford such systems must rely on other sources of energy. 

## Materials
The author now turns to a study of the production of materials. He points to the fact that concrete is the predominant building material that humanity has used during our capitalist phase of development. 

The author notes that the production of concrete involves a direct release of CO2, along with energy needed for heating during the process. He notes that around 5% of the world energy budget is devoted to the creation of concrete. In China, this figure is between 7% and 9%. 

While the author points out it is possible to create concrete with no CO2 release, he says this is 2 to 3 times as energy intensive. 

Moving on to steel, the author notes that this has been the fundamental metal of industrial society. Nowadays, 70% of [[USA|American]] steel comes from recycling, with 30% coming from iron ore. The processing of iron ore requires some CO2 release. 

If we assume that the world requires drastic reduction in CO2 emission, the author claims that we must do two things:

1. Base the steel industry overwhelmingly on recycling, supplementing with new steel as little as possible.
2. Other metals must be substituted for steel when we can, probably aluminum.

The author claims that aluminum costs 3 times as much as steel to use. Therefore, when the author examines steel and concrete alternatives, he finds that we will have to use alternatives that are about 3 times as expensive. 

## Transport
The author notes that the two engines of globalization are the high bypass turbine and the high compression diesel. One powers aircraft, the other powers freight transport such as ships and trains. 

Since both of these technologies use oil, the author asks how the transport system will survive as this fuel is phased out, either through regulation or through scarcity.

It is clear to the author that costs will rise in terms of shipping. Ships will have to adapt to the changing circumstances, either by incorporating more expensive modern methods, or reverting to previous methods which require more [[labor]] and therefore more costs as well. 

The author notes that nobody has yet built an aluminum ship near the size of current container ships, but moves on to say that propulsion is the larger issue. He says that wind remains the most likely alternative power source, and that some new technologies exist in this realm. 

While the author mentions that nuclear power is a tried and true possibility on military vessels, he notes that it's quite different to use it in a much more broad commerical way. 

From this standpoint, the author argues that the process of globalization will be undermined by the increased shipping costs. This will apply specifically to ocean transport, as there are easier electrification methods for rail shipping. 

40% of rail is electrified in [[China]], compared to 1% in the [[USA]]. The author points to the [[state]] ownership of the rail in China compared to the private networks in the US as the reason for this. 

The author concludes (rather abruptly) by saying that all these forces stand to undercut globalization, increase the value of land connections relative to oceanic ones, and shift favor to local production relative to global production. The author claims that this slowing of globalization, combined with the slowing of birth rates, will halt the forces that have worked to undermine labor's position relative to [[capital]] in the last century.
