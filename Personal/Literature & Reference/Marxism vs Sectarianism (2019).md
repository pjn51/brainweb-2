The article begins by explaining that [[opportunism]] and [[sectarianism]] are two sides of the same coin, and it's only natural that in an epoch of [[reformism]], some would turn to [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] [[sectarianism]] as a misguided attempt to course correct (PDF, p.1). 

Outlining the reason for this article, the authors say that we must arm ourselves against sectarianism in the aftermath of an attempted disruption of the [[IMT]] by [[Spartacist League]] offshoot, the IG (Ibid, p.1). 

The authors explain that in the last analysis, we're dealing with the difference between [[Marxism]] and formalism, [[dialectics]] versus formal logic, and scientific socialism versus unscientific dogmatism (Ibid, p.2). 

# The importance of dialectics and Marxist theory
Discussing the tasks of the IMT, the article states that the art of building a Marxist group is maintaining a high political level while seizing opportunities to grow - requiring a patient approach that dispells the confusion of the mass movement (Ibid, p.2). 

The article describes opportunism and sectarianism as fundamentally [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] tendencies which we should defend against via an education in the method fo Marxism (Ibid, p.2). 

The authors quote Trotsky, who says that we must absorb the Marxist mode of analysis if we are to withstand the dominant tide of rigid, mechanical thinking that bourgeois society produces (Kindle, loc 50). 

# "Freedom of criticism"
The authors argue that the hallmark of [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]] is an "unwavering, principled class independence on all political questions, combined with infinite tactical flexibility," and explain that this is backed by an organizational method of [[democratic centralism]]. They outline how [[Freedom of debate enables unity of action]] (PDF, p.3). This is restating the idea that [[Bolshevism requires firmness on content, flexibility on form]]. 

Discussing the sectarian organizational method, the article says that sectarians feel the need to "go into writing" on any and all questions, and the discussion should continue as long as they wish. The authors draw parallels with [[Lenin|Lenin's]] critique of the revisionist "freedom of criticism" defense in [[What is to be Done (1902)]] (Ibid, p.3). This also reminds me of how [[The petty bourgeoisie prefers endless debate]]. 

# The Marxist method
The authors assert that theory, first generalized from practical experience, must be connected back to reality in order to be useful. Instead, they explain, sectarians treat theory as eternally fixed and use it as a purity test - the very opposite of Bolshevism (Ibid, p.3). In other words, [[Thought and activity are inseperable]], [[Action verifies perception]], and [[The metaphysical mode of analysis has limitations]]. 

Quoting Trotsky, the article clarifies that although sectarians swear by Marxism time and time again, their method is the negation of Marxist analysis, which always starts with experience, and returns to that experience to verify abstractions (Kindle, loc 86). 

Continuing on this theme, the authors explain that a historical prediction is always going to be conditional, and is going to be more condition the more concrete it is. This means, we are told, that they must be updated as new information appears, and the situation changes (Ibid, loc 101). 

The article also says that because of this, the dialectic is not a magic formula that can tell us all the answers. Instead, it continues, we must use the dialectic to guide our scientific investigation (Ibid, loc 108).

# What are we building and what stage are we at?
The authors explain that the IMT is dedicated to building a mass revolutionary party that can guide the working class to power. However, they coninue, the IMT is a *tendency* for a reason - because this is reflective of the stage the organization is in (Ibid, loc 121). 

On the other hand, the article continues, sectarians believe that no matter how small their group is, they are already the verified revolutionary party, and therefore ought never to make any accomodations for other groups (Ibid, loc 135). 

The article defends the IMT from claims that they have broken class lines, saying that they have never crossed the class divide or placed any faith in bourgeois parties, unlike the [[CWI]]. They explain that this could have temporarily gotten them more support, but would have been the death of the IMT as a revolutionary tendency (Ibid, loc 152). 

# The importance and use of the program
The authors explain the purpose of a program as a political tool that unifies the revolutionary tendency, and later party, around a political perspective and strategy. They quote Trotsky, who says that the different sections of the [[Fourth International]] must orient themselves towards their local struggles and use a revised program to do so (Ibid, loc 181). 

The article turns to the modern American context, saying that the IMT's method of engaging with Sanders' supporters while dispelling illusions in the bourgeois [[Democratic Party|Democrats]] is a good example of the above perspective. The authors argue that there was an opening here because the DNC cannot resolve the contradiction between their working class supporters and their defense of the bourgeoisie, resulting in a tension that Marxists should exploit (Ibid, loc 192). 

Attacking the sectarian method, the article explains that sectarians see no purpose in reaching new supporters, and instead merely declare the need for revolution without considering how to connect with those who are moving to the left (Ibid, loc 207). 

Quoting [[Engels]], the authors clarify that the best way to gain theoretical clarity is through making mistakes, and this is the *only* method for a class to learn (Ibid, loc 214). [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]]. 

Instead of using a dialectical method, the article continues, sectarians view everything as either black or white. They see, according to the article, that a mass workers' party would be initially reformist, and say that this is bad because reformism is bad (Ibid, loc 251). 

# The fight against sectarian ultraleftism
Summarizing the two currents, the authors define opportunism as the search for shortcuts via class collaboration, and sectarian ultraleftism as the abstention from the class struggle out of a fear of contamination with impure ideas (Ibid, loc 259). They argue that these pressures must both be resisted (Ibid, loc 265). [[Class collaboration is opportunist]], while [[Abstention from class struggle is sectarian]]. [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]]. 

Trotsky is quoted as saying that opportunism and sectarianism have a feature in common, in that they both take a few factors that they deem to be the important ones, isolate them from reality, and ignore all other factors or circumstances (Ibid, loc 280). 

By creating this mechanical schema, and counterposing it to reality, the article says, sectarians faile to make an impression on the mentality of the workers, since the latter exist in the real world, not the simplistic realm of the sectarian (Ibid, loc 288). 

The authors say that even when the sectarians are correct in their analysis, such as their analysis that reformism is a dead end, Marxists must not only "say what is," but use "what is" as a departure point for a productive message (Ibid, loc 303). [[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]]. 

The article takes a look at the [[Kornilov]] affair during the [[Russia|Russian]] revolution. They explain the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] strategy: struggle against Kornilov while placing no trust in [[Kerensky]] or his government, and in fact pointing out the latter's incapability of defending the gains made by the February revolution. Their opinion is that sectarians would refuse to defend an opportunist, reformist, and ultimately reactionary government and stay on the sidelines of such a struggle (Ibid, loc 318). 

# Trotsky's proletarian military policy
The authors point out that military mobilization can create opportunities for the Marxists. They argue that the ruling class was forced to organize and arm the workers on a massive scale during [[WW2]], and that a Marxist tendency should have called for militarization under the control of the [[unions]] in order to better equip the workers' movement for the overthrow of [[capitalism]] (Ibid, loc 350, loc 365). 

Quoting Trotsky, the authors make the point that we cannot oppose compulsory military training for the same way that we cannot oppose compulsory education, and instead we must struggle within both of these realms (Ibid, loc 372). 

Making an electoral analogy, the article says that this is the same reason we cannot abstain from working within the elections of bourgeois society. To do so, they continue, would be to cut ourselves off from anyone with illusions about that process (Ibid, loc 409).
