This book seeks to answer the question: [[What makes a good story?]]

# Welcome to the Moth

# No notes, no net
The authors invite us to search our memories for stories, and say that we should consider what our "greatest hits" are, what moments in life stick with us, and what stories we feel compelled to tell new friends (p.15).

# Mining for memories
The founder of the Moth argues that every good story is based around a decision that the storyteller makes. He says that good storytellers focus less on what happened, and more on what you decided to do (p.40).

The authors explain that when it comes to compelling stories, vulnerability is power. They say that by sharing stories, we open the opportunity to get closer to one another, and vulnerability helps with that process (p.48).

# The foundation
Moving from ideation to construction, the book tells us that stakes give urgency and energy to stories. We are told that these stakes force the audience to actually care, by explaining why the protagonist actually cares about what's happening (p.51). This seems important - [[Good stories have stakes]]. 

Continuing on this theme, the book explains that stakes can manifest as problems that need to be solved, struggles to be overcome, questions, mysteries, or unexpected events. They argue that good stakes turn a list of events into a real story with tension (p.54). This makes me think of another idea, [[Good stories require contradiction]]. 

Furthermore, the authors outline how stakes can be *external* or *internal.* Internal stakes, they continue, are those within the mind of the protagonist ("If I don't succeed, I'm a loser", etc) while external stakes are the material consequences of their failure ("If I fail, I will die", etc). They argue that good stories have both kinds of stakes (p.57). This makes sense, [[Stakes can be internal or external]]. 

Moving on, the authors explain the difference between an anecdote and a story. They say that an anecdote is an amusing or interesting event, while a story strings together multiple events into a narriative that ends with transformation, i.e. [[Good stories involve change]] (p.60). The authors later expand on this, inviting us to ask ourselves what moments in our lives caused us to change our behavior forever (p.65).
