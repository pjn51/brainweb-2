The philisophical 'problem' of knowledge only arises when we view humanity as separate from the world, and our minds as separate from our bodies. Both these notions come from a standpoint of [[metaphysics]], where things are viewed independently of their context.

Woods explains that we think not only with our minds, but with our whole bodies. And that our [[class consciousness]] does not separate us from the world, but *connects us to it.*

The philosophy of [[materialism]] posits that consciousness is, like life, a specific organization of matter. However, Woods explains that we can see that the whole is greater than the sum of our parts if we use [[dialectics]]. 

Counter to materialism, [[idealism]] keeps reaffirming that consciousness is simply a mystery, even as science explains more and more of the pieces that go into the structure of our brains and the way we generate consciousness.

## Descartes and Dualism
Idealism posits that the ultimate expression of the world is in the Ideal. That the material world is an imitation of the metaphysical one, that our eternal soul is who we really are, while our body is merely a transient shell. 

Confusing this issue, Descartes brought forth the idea of dualism. He stated that the material world and the world of thoughts and consciousness were two distinct realms. Ever since, people have been arguing about how these two worlds interact if they're distinct on such a basic level. 

Woods states that the mistake here is to think of consciousness *as a thing*, whereas we should think of it *as a process.* This has been backed up by neuroscience. We now know what is happening inside the brain as thoughts occur. Electrical impulses are being sent between neurons. This pretty firmy does away with the idea that thought is on some kind of different plane of existance than other kinds of material things. 

## Hand and Brain
The development of consciousness is the result of a relationship between the development of the physical tools that humans have had available (such as our hands), and the mental tools that we use to put these physical tools to work. 

## Marx's Philosophical Revolution
Marx took the mechanical materialism of people like Feuerbach and elevated it. He saw that the really important thing was the relationship between things, not the things as static isolated objects. He introduced [[dialectics]] to materialism. 

## [[alienation]] and Bourgeois Society
Bourgeois philosophy reflects the class interests of bourgeois society. The ruling class want the working class to view the world from an individual perspective, and not a collective one. However, it is capitalism itself that is forcing together the masses of the world into the urban working class, and alienating them from the product of their [[labor]]. 

The only way to escape this sense of [[alienation]] is to change the material basis of society. Through revolution, we can *revolutionize thought by revolutionizing society.*
