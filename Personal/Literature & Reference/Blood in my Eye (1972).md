# Introduction
This book, written by George Jackson in the 70s, is his personal political philosophy and theory as a member of [[the black power movement]]. I agree with some parts, but I find other parts to be really ultra-left and even adventuristic in some ways. Overall, it represents his unique social context and worldview. 

# Points of Agreement
Jackson certainly isn't a [[reformism|reformist]] or a social democrat. He hates [[capitalism]] and the [[state]] with a mood and tone that can only be described as righteous fury. I agree with him that revolution is the only answer to our current situation. 

I also agree with his emphasis on the prison system. He obviously *lived* this system, and so it naturally occupies a central position in his thoughts. But I agree that not enough attention is sometimes paid to the alternate unvierse that exists alongside the rest of society, with a combined population more than the state of New Mexico. A world of steel and concrete, which is totally ignored by the vast majority of the rest of society. 

# Jackson's Life and the Political Context of this Work
I think the attitude Jackson has is completely natural given his life story and the context in which the book was written. He was incarcerated for the majority of his life, and was eventually assasinated by prison guards who grew tired of his organizing work that he did constantly in prison.

Because of his total [[alienation]] from society from an early age, Jackson's outlook is that of the progressive layer of the [[lumpenproletariat]]. This has a strong influence on the way that he views the world. Lumpens tend to have less to lose, and face the wrath of the state much more directly than workers tend to. Therefore, they have a life-or-death interest in the struggle. This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Because they have no way out, they may be dedicated revolutionaries, unlike members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] who can disappear at the moment of confrontation.

On the other hand, the aggression inherent in the lumpen relationship with society can be alienating to potential allies who occupy a different social position. Workers who have more to lose and who are more connected with the rest of society may be put off by the often overtly violent tone and method of action by lumpen revolutionaries. 

Moving beyond the personal, it's also important to understand the social context of this work. It was written in 1972, as the tide of struggle ebbed. This was the era of reaction after the gains made in the 60s. The [[Black Panther Party]] was being crushed, and George himself was killed just after releasing this book. 

In such a period of reaction, it's natural for the vanguard elements to feel more and more isolated from the working class and the mass movement. This can lead to feelings of betrayal, and a loss of faith in the revolutionary role that the working class can play. It can also lead to the ideas that George puts forward in this book, that the vanguard's role is to provoke a confrontation in order to restart the fires of revolution. 

Throughout the book, George indicates a passionate desire to fight, to kill police and drive them out of his community. Such a reaction is totally justified and natural for someone in his position, but most workers in the 70s simply didn't relate to those ideas. To call for the killing of cops, for direct assault on the state, at a time when the working class was not only unprepared to fight, but actually in retreat, is [[ultraleftism]]. 

# Jackson's ideas
## Examples of Ultra-Leftism
Jackson outright denounces the passing out of theory and work within unions as "playing at revolution." 

When he spoke about unions, he claimed that they were no longer a site of struggle because the leadership had been so thoroughly bought-out by the ruling class. Has he read [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]]? 

## Examples of Adventurism
Jackson seems to embrace the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] idea of "propaganda of the deed" at certain points. 

> People must see the venerated institutions and the "omnipotent administrator" actually under physical attack. They must be assured that the heavens will not hurl lightling bolts at the people's heads for challenging the rights of property. (p. 50)

The most striking example of adventurism comes in the form of Jackson's praise for Jonathan, his younger brother. At the age of 17, Jonathan took part in a raid on Marin County Courthouse. The goal was to take hostages in order to secure the release of political prisoners, including Jackson. The group took hostages, but most of them were killed in a shootout as they attempted to escape. 

Jackson saw his brother as a brave martyr for the revolution, and spent no time whatsoever questioning wether it was a good decision to engage in a totally suicidal mission like that, rather than focusing on political education or something that would last. 

## Jackson's Outline of the Vanguard's Role
Jackson's basic idea is to have two wings of the organization - an aboveground political wing, and a belowground military wing. While this is a pattern often seen, including with the Russian revolution, I feel like there is a time and a place for it, and 1970s America was *not* the correct circumstance for open confrontation with the state. 

Much of the book is dedicated to decribing the workings of a guerrilla military force, to wage Peoples' War in cities across the US. Jackson describes the stockpiling of weapons and food, the construction of secret tunnels, and the use of assymetrical warfare against agents of the state. 

While these sorts of tactics may be useful in some circumstances, it is representative of a vanguard that realizes the masses are no longer behind them, and one which realizes that it can no longer rely on the economic leverage of the working class to challenge the state. 

Instead of using the economic position of the working class, the vanguard is compelled to ask more and more of its members as the noose tightens. In turn, this shrinks and hardens the vanguard to its core of mostly lumpen revolutionaries who have no way to escape the struggle. 

Another issue with this conception of the [[vanguard]] is a matter of resources. Jackson's conception simultaneously requires vastly more resources than relying on the strength of the workers would, while cutting themselves off from the resources that a stronger conncection with the workers would bring. Jackson describes a network of safe houses, armored cars, heavy weaponry, and dedicated soldiers that work round the clock. 

This doesn't even mention the resources needed to create the [[mutual aid]] networks that he describes alongside the political and military structures. 

## Jackson's Analysis of the Working Class
Jackson divides the working class into two groups, a "left to neutral" group, and a "right-oriented" group. 

> In fact, the working class of [[USA]] 1971 can be realistically divided into two mutually exclusive and conflicting sections, one right-oriented and conservative, the other left to neutral. One explanation for this phenomenon is the loss over the years (to fascist nationalistic propaganda and state-controlled unions) of a clear-cut class consciuousness. In effect, it can be said that this right-oriented sector of the working class is a new class, a new pig class. (p. 63)

Jackson goes on to say that those with "pig tendencies" may be redeemable, but outright pigs must be destroyed. He also goes on to claim that it is this pig class from which the state draws the most support. To me, this seems to betray a misunderstanding of the way that classes are defined. To be a member of a class isn't to think in a certain way, or to have a certain set of politics even. Classes are defined by their relationship to production. Therefore, this "pig class" is just a reactionary tendency within the working class. It shares its class position with the progressive elements of the working class.

This is also kind of a static view. Of course there will always be *some* reactionary element to the working class, based on the material conditions that inform the outlook of the workers. This is to be expected, and isn't cause to believe that something about the working class has fundamentally changed. This is just how the working class is outside of revolutionary periods, and even often is *within* revolutionary periods. 

Overall, even as Jackson claims that the proletariat is the revolutionary class, he places the [[lumpenproletariat]] at its head. 

> The outlaw and the lumpen will make the revolution. The people, the workers, will adopt it. This must be the new order of things, after the fact of the modern industrial fascist state. (p. 124)

## Fascism
Like other thinkers from this milieu, Jackson seems to have an extremely broad definintion of [[fascism]]. He characterizes the US as fascist, as well as most other countries it seems. 

> We will never have a complete definition of fascism, because it is in constant motion, showing a new face to fit any particular set of problems that arise to threaten the predomincance of the traditionalist, capitalist ruling class. But if one were forced for the sake of clarity to define it in a word simple enough for all to understand, that word would be 'reform.' 

Interestingly, he mentions in passing that it was the banning of the Communist Party that marked the American transition to fascism. 

There are certainly aspects of his analysis that I agree with. He points out the fact that fascism arises in response to the workers' movement, and that it is a last-ditch attempt to maintain class society in the face of revolution. 

But wait, the plot thickens! Jackson breaks down fascism into three stages. *Out of power* as the first stage, and then *in power but unsecure* as the second, and *securely in power* as the final stage. 

Out of power, Jackson points out the use of anti-capitalist retoric by the fascists. Once in power but not yet secure, the fascists are more savage in their repression of their enemies. Once secure, Jackson claims that the fascist movement is more relaxed in permitting criticism. 

I think this is a useful idea, since it cuts through the confusing self-proclaimed ideology of fascism, which has no real solutions or central ideas. Instead, it uses whatever ideas are needed to promote the interests of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] and the ruling class, and then the personal interests of the fascist leadership once securely in power. 

As for the [[USA]], Jackson claims that FDR was a fascist. This aligns with his definition of fascism as [[reformism]] meant to preserve [[capitalism]]. 

In general, Jackson seems to conflate the development of monopoly capitalism with the development of fascism. 

## Class Consciousness
I think Jackson has some incorrect ideas about the way that [[class consciousness]] forms. Apart from the misunderstanding of the "pig class" that I write about above, he also says...

> We'll get stuck with long theoretical explanations on consciousness or objective conditions when it's clear that consciousness will not grow unless there is someone among us willing to feed it. 
> Consciousness grows in spirals. Growth implies feeding and being fed. We feed consciousness by feeding people, addressing ourselves to their needs, the basic and social needs, working, organizing towards a united national left. 

In one way, this is true. The vanguard can play a very helpful role in spurring on the development of genuine class consciousness. But I think Jackson tends to take this too far. In the epoch of declining class consciousness among American workers, he naturally wants to find some way to take a shortcut around the really broad processes that cause class consciousness and solidarity to grow, the processes of capitalism as a global system. 

This leads to an over-exertion on the part of the vanguard, and the bringing of the vanguard into direct conflict with the state too early. One only has to look at the Black Panthers to see what the effect of that confrontation will be. Countless revolutionaries that could have spent their whole lives refining their theory and finding the correct lessons from the 60s instead threw themselves against the state and were killed. 

It is in that legacy that the extremely confused American left developed. It is the lack of clear analysis resulting from these kinds of ideas that has slowed the development of left organizations in the current period of resurgence. 

## Jackson's Thoughts on the United Front and Racism
Jackson emphasized the need for a broad left coalition, especially when talking about the prisoner movement. He said that all organizations should do what they can on their own, but preferred the idea of [[democratic centralism]] under what he called the "Vanguard Black Panther Communist Party." 

Jackson said that white racism was the main obstacle to a united left. He viewed racism as a byproduct of capitalism, and therefore believed that it was the system that must be crushed, and only after that system had been replaced could we deal with the issue of racism on a basic level. However, he also believed that action to fight against racism must be taken while we dismantle the system that creates it. 

Racism is the one place where I really have to hand it to Jackson. With how angry he is, he never turns his fury on white people in general.
