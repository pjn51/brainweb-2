[[Alan Woods]] begins by talking about the demise of the Soviet Union, and how we should study the October revolution. He says that [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]]. 

# Intervention of the masses
Woods explains that Trotsky said that revolutions represent the direct intervention of the masses into the running of society. He says that in normal society, the majority are content to allow the "experts" to manage society.

He also notes that during normal times, we can still see that [[Revolutions follow a molecular process]]. 

# Wars and revolutions
Woods mentions that [[Human consciousness is conservative]], and that the October revolution represented a massive "catching up" of workers' perception of the world to reality. 

He also brings in the concept of [[combined and uneven development]], saying that Russian industry in some ways was incredibly advanced, and in other ways primative. He says this allowed the formation of an advanced working class in the cities, but not as a large force in society as a whole. 

# Narodniks
Woods says that Lenin always struggled against the idea that there was a uniquely [[Russia|Russian]] road to socialism, an idea of the [[Narodniks]]. 

He says that Lenin and Trotsky were commited internationalists, who cannot be classified as Russians really. 

Woods discusses the events of 1905, where monarchist workers attempting to give a petition to the Tsar were killed, leading to a chain of events that would culminate in an armed insurrection. He explains that because of these events, the Social Democrats were transformed from a tiny fringe to a decisive force. 

# First World War
Woods goes over the wrinkles that [[WW1]] added to the Russian situation.
