There can be no impartial social science in class society. Unsurprisingly, both the Tsar and liberals viewed Marxism with hatred, seeing it as an evil sect. Marxism is the furthest thing from an isolated sect. Marxism is the direct continuation of the best of humanity’s thought. 

## One
The philosophy of Marxism is [[dialectical materialism|materialism]]. This materialism was born in the Enlightenment, and is the only view of the world consistent with modern science. However, the supporters of class society try with all their might to propose an idealist view of the world. This always ends up, in one way or another, coming back to the support of [[religion]]. 

[[Marx]] defended vigorously the materialist outlook, but he also moved it forward from what others had said in the past. He combined it with Hegel’s ideas about dialectics. Dialectics is “the doctrine of development in its fullest, deepest and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of the human knowledge that provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter.” 

Marx also applied this method of analysis to humanity, calling it historical materialism. By doing this, he showed how capitalism had grown out of [[feudalism]] through entirely predictable and material processes. 

Just as humanity’s knowledge about the world reflects the world independent of us, so too does our social knowledge and understanding of society reflect the economic conditions of society in which we find ourselves. Our political institutions are a [[The dialectic of base and superstructure|superstructure]] that develop out of the economic foundation.

## Two
Understanding that the economic system laid the foundation for all of society, Marx focused his analysis there, resulting in Capital, his principal work. 
Through his economic analysis, and building on the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, Marx came to his understanding of the [[labor theory of value]]. 
This analysis, together with the understanding of [[surplus value]], is the cornerstone of Marxist economics. 

[[capitalism]] leads to the centralization of [[capital]], which destroys small-scale production and throws more and more [[petty bourgeoisie]] into the ranks of the [[proletariat]], which it expands, regiments, and organizes. Production becomes more and more social, while appropriation remains individual. 

## Three
Early [[socialism]] emerged at the same time as the horrors of capitalism first reared their head. However, this was socialism of a utopian variety. It had no basis in a scientific understanding of how society developed, and therefore it had no real way forward past capitalism. 

The real breakthrough of Marx was to link the fight for a better world to a scientific analysis of how to get there, and what class could lead the struggle. 
The early utopians failed to see capitalism for what it really is: a desperate and brutal class struggle that will be fought to the death. Either the bourgeoisie will be done away with, or all the classes of society are doomed.
