# Review
This pamphlet is made up from lectures deliverd by [[Marx]] in 1847, and is a great introduction to [[Marxism|Marxist]] economics. It was edited by [[Engels]], who added some clarification. I think that overall, I need to read this through a couple more times before I will really understand the message of this piece.

# Introduction
[[Engels]] begins this introduction by explaining the origin of this work, and how the conclusion to it was prevented by the supression of the paper it was published in. 

Engels remarks that now, many years later, that Marx may not have approved of the fact that it is now published exactly as he said it back then. He explains that in the 1840s, Marx was still in the process of developing his ideas. 

Because of this, Engels announces that he has rewritten this pamphlet to align with Marx's later ideas, specifically about the difference between *[[labor]]* and *labor power.* He says that this difference is critical for understanding political economy.

Outlining the errors of bourgeois economists, Engels explains that the classical notion was always that the employer buys and pays for the labor of his or her workers. He adds that political economy also held that the prices of all [[commodities]], including labor, continually rise and fall. Engels notes that the fluctuations often appear like pure chance. 

Engels says that bourgeois economists sought to find a rule that explained this rising and falling of prices. He says that they searched for the central point around which the prices of commodities fluctuated. The author states that classical political economy believed they had found this point - the labor incorporated into the production of the commodity. 

Engels announces that we may stop at this point for now, but reminds us that this argument is far from watertight. He says that even the bourgeois economists that assert the above point always include reservations and restrictions outlined by Marx in his [[Critique of Political Economy (1859)]] and in the first volume of [[Capital (1867)]]. 

Moving on, Engels proclaims that "as soon as the economists applied this determination of value by labor to the commodity 'labor', they fell from one contradiction to another." He says that when asked how the value of labor determined, these economists replied that it was determined by the labor embodied in it. Engels highlights the circular nature of this argument, where the value of labor can only be calculated in labor itself. 

Engels explains that bourgeois economics attempted to escape this situation by saying that the value of a commodity is determined by its *cost of production.* He says they defined the cost of production of labor as the cost of production of *the laborer,* since they could not calculate the cost of production of labor. Engels says that it follows that the cost of production of a worker is the sum price of the means of subsistence which on the average enables him or her to work, stay alive, and to prepare his or her replacement, i.e. to reproduce the working class for future society. 

Moving from generality to example, Engels asks us to envision a laborer, who needs $3 per day to survive. He says that they are paid $3 a day, and work 12 hours a day. Engels says that the capitalist calcualates that the laborer (a machinist) turns raw material purchased at $20, plus energy which costs $1 per commodity made, will all add up to $24 for the production of a single commodity (assuming it takes the worker 12 hours to make the commodity).

$$
L + M + E = $24
$$
- L: labor cost -> $3
- M: raw materials -> $20
- E: energy -> $1

When selling this commodity, Engels continues, the capitalist finds that he can sell it for $27, which is a profit of $3. Engels asks us where this $3 comes from. 

$$
$24 \not= $27
$$

Turning momentarily to the topic of commodities, Engels says that classical economics holds that commodities are, in the long run, sold at their values. For them, he says, this means that they are sold at prices that correspond with the necessary quantities of labor contained in them. 

However, Engels argues, if this were the case, where did the $3 come from? He reminds us that the capitalist already paid for the labor, which was $3, and all the raw materials, which is $21. Engels puts forward that the only place this extra $3 could have come from was from the labor, meaning that the worker added $6 in value to the commodity, not $3. 

At this point, Engels introduces us to this worker directly, who complains that he hasn't been paid $6, and that his boss claims his labor is worth only $3. Engels says this situation presents an "insoluble contradicton," since now it appears that labor has not one value, but two values. This was a blind alley, Engels asserts, that was only escaped by [[Marx]]. 

Engels argues that what economists had termed to be the cost of production of "labor" was really the cost of production of the worker, and that what the worker sold the capitalist was *not* his or her labor. 

Engels quotes Marx, who says...

> So soon as his labour really begins,” says Marx, “it ceases to belong to him, and therefore can no longer be sold by him.

At the most, Engels asserts, a worker can sell his or her *future* labor, meaning that the worker assumes the obligation of executing a certain task in a certain amount of time. To Engels, this means that the worker does not sell his or her labor, since that would mean the labor had already been compeleted. Instead, Engels supposes that the worker puts his or her *labor-power* at the disposal of the capitalist for a certain amount of time or for the performance of a certain task.

Engels says that the cost of production of this labor power coincides with the cost of production of the laborer. 

Turning back to the above example, Engels explains that if the worker were to work for 6 hours instead of 12, he would have generated $3 in value for the capitalist, and would have been paid $3. Instead, Engels says that the worker is forced to work 12 hours for $3, meaning that for the last 6 hours of his shift, he is performing unpaid labor for the capitalist.

Engels says that the distinction between labor and labor power allows us to escape the problems of previous economists. He says that in our current society, labor-power is a commodity, but has the peculiar quality of being a *value creating commodity.* He notes that when applied properly, labor-power can actually create more value than it posesses itself. 

Engels thinks that due to scientific advancement, the ratio of value created by labor to its price further rises, meaning that the proportion of the working day that the worker works essentially for free also rises, since in fewer and fewer hours the worker has created the value that he or she will be paid in wages. 

Generalizing this fact to the nature of society, Engels remarks that all the value created in society is created in this way by the working class, but this value is appropriated by the capitalist class, since it is this class that has access to the [[capital]] and tools enabling productive labor. Because of this, Engels notes that the working class only gets back a portion of the mass of commodities that they produce, and this portion is shrinking all the time relative to the portion that is hoarded by the capitalist class and the landlord class. 

Engels outlines how this situation leads to crisis. He says that one the one hand, a gigantic mass of commodities is produced by the capitalists, too much to sell to the working class for reasons outlined above. But on the other hand, Engels brings up the fact that a greater and greater proportion of the population is proletarianized and stripped of their ability to purchase this mass of commodities. 

> The splitting up of society into a small class, immoderately rich, and a large class of wage-labourers devoid of all property, brings it about that this society smothers in its own superfluidity, while the great majority of its members are scarcely, or not at all, protected from extreme want.

Engels proclaims that over time, this condition is becoming more and more absurd, and that we can and must abolish this state of affairs. He says that one day we can have a society where these class distinctions are no longer necessary for production.

> [!note]
> I think the difference between labor and labor-power is still a little unclear for me. My current understanding is that the worker doesn't sell the actual labor, i.e. the value created by their labor, they sell their potential to create value. This means that the potential value of the labor-power they're selling is usually higher than the wage they are paid for this potential value. 

# Preliminary
Marx notes that he and Engels have been criticized for not elaborating on the "economic conditions which form the material basis of the present struggles between lasses and nations." 

Marx explains that this was because they were forced to follow the development of the class struggle as it unfolded, and didn't have the time to go to the root of the underlying issues since so much was happening in the recent past across Europe as [[feudalism]] fell away in country after country and the bourgeoisie assumed power. 

Marx says that this series of events confirmed that every true reformation will remain a utopia "until the proletarian revolution and the feudalistic counter-revolution have been pitted against each other in a world-wide war."

> [!question]
> By saying that the workers must be pitted against feudal counter-revolution, does Marx mean that this is the only way to usher in capitalism? Or to win communism? 
> 
> What does Marx be by reformation?

Outlining the rest of the work, Marx explains that he plans to describe the economic foundations of capitalism without assuming any prior knowledge about classical political economy. 

# What are wages? How are they determined?
Marx poses that if several workers were asked what [[wages]] are, they would all agree that wages are "the amount of [[currency|money]] which the capitalist pays for a certain period of work or for a certain amount of work."

Marx says that the idea of a capitalist purchasing *labor* is actually an illusion, and that the capitalist is really buying a worker's *labor-power* for a certain time period. He says that the capitalist purchases this labor-power as a commodity, just like any other commodity such as sugar or metal. 

> [!question]
> I still don't really get the difference between labor and labor power. I wish Marx went into why the selling of labor is just an illusion. Unless Marx just means that the worker is really selling their potential to create value, rather than the exact quantity of value that they create at work. But I'm not sure if that definition is accurate. 

Marx explains that labor-power is exchanged for money, another commodity, at a given ratio, depending on the branch of industry and some other factors. Marx argues that since money is really just an intermediary betwen the selling of labor-power to attiain other commodities, we can simplify this exchange. He simlifies it by saying that the worker exchanges his or her labor-power for other sorts of commodities, such as meat or clothing. 

Therefore, Marx says that money expresses the relation in which labor-power is exchanged for other commodities, i.e. that money is the exchange-value of labor power. 

Speaking to these other commodities directly, Marx outlines how the exchange value of a commodity, estimated in money, is its *price.* He says that a "wage" is just another term for the price of labor-power.

Marx dives into a specific example to illustrate his next point. He instructs us to imagine a weaver, and says that the capitalst supplies him with the loom and yarn, and pays him a wage to get to work. Marx describes how the weaver turns the yarn into cloth, which the capitalist can now sell for $20. 

Marx asks if the wages paid to the worker are a share of the cloth that the capitalist sold for $20? He answers that no, they are not. He explains that long before the cloth is sold, the capitalist has paid the worker from money already on hand. For Marx, this indicates that in no way are the commodities that the worker produces the source of his wage. 

Marx elaborates that regardless of if the capitalist is able to recoup the cost of production of the cloth, the worker will be paid and therefore the wages paid to the worker must come from capital, just like we would use to cover the cost of any other commodity, such as steel or bricks. Marx explains that therefore, wages are not a share of the worker in the commodities that they produce, but are a part of the already existing commodities with which the capitalist is able to buy a certain amount of labor-power.

> [!question]
> I'm a bit confused by this point. Couldn't the argument be made that the capitalist got his or her capital from utilizing the labor-power of previous workers, and is using that lump of capital to pay the later workers? I guess I don't really understand the point that Marx is making here, other than that labor-power is a commodity.



# By what is the price of a commodity determined?
There are multiple forms of competition that all have an effect on the price of any [[commodities]]. There is competition among the sellers, because all of them want to sell their products. There is competiton among the buyers, because in a scarce market all buyers want to buy the [[commodities]]. There is competition between buyers and sellers because buyers want the lowest price, while sellers want the highest price. 
	
Depending on which form of competition is higher, the price will raise or lower. If there is a lot of competition between buyers to buy a commodity, but very little competition between sellers to sell the commodity, then the price of the commodity will increase. If the inverse is true, the price will drop. 

When the price of a commodity falls, the prices of other commodities have risen in comparison to that commodity. Money is itself a commodity. 

These fluctuations happen around a central point, and that central point is the cost of production of the commodity in question. 

[[capital]] can emigrate or immigrate into whole industries based on the prices of commodities in that industry. If the prices fall below a desireable rate for long enough, investments will be moved to more profitable industries. This process causes shock waves that rumble throughout all of capitalist society. 

# By what are wages determined?
The average cost of labor power is the average cost of production of the labor power, because labor power is a commodity. 

But what is the cost of production of labor power? It is the cost of reproduction of the laborer. 

# The nature and growth of capital
[[capital]] is accumulated labor, that serves as a means of expanding the productive forces. Those who live off this capital are the bourgeoisie.

For something to be considered capital, it has to exist under certain conditions. For one, it has to be being used to generate more capital. Your car is not capital, while a taxi company's car *is* capital. Right now, my computer is not capital, but if I were to become a data scientist, it *would* be capital when I was at work. 

Another condition capital must exist under is the total relations of production of society. Since capital can only exist under capitalism and commodity exchange on the market, society has to have developed into a capitalist mode of production for capital to exist. 

Capital, since it must have labor applied to it in order to expand, depends on the existance of a class which is compelled to apply its labor to capital, aka the [[proletariat]]. 

In this way, living labor serves accumulated labor ('dead labor') under a capitalist mode of production. 

# Relation of wage-labor to capital
The worker exchanges their labor-power for existing means of survival in the form of wages. The capitalist recieves this labor-power, which they put to work expanding their capital. 

In effect, the worker is trading their ability to provide for themselves for a life of wage labor. They are now more and more dependent on the capitalist for survival. 

Bourgeois economists maintain that the interests of the workers and of the capitalists are aligned - that an increase in the productive forces benefits both equally. This is a lie. 

In order to discuss this, we need to get straight the difference between *real wages* and *relative wages*. Real wages are determined in the amount of commodities that a worker can buy with a certain wage, it's the buying power of the wage given. On the other hand, relative wages refers to the percentage of the [[surplus value]] that goes back into the hands of the worker instead of into the capitalist's profit. 

While an increase in real wages may happen due to an advancement in the productive capability of society, relative wages will never increase, and will rapidly decrease when capital expands. 

For example, the living standards of the workers may grow larger over time, but it will always be shrinking in relation to the living standards of the capitalist next door. This has the psychological effect of making the working class less and less satisfied with their lot in life. 

# The general law that determines the rise and fall of wages and profits
The selling price of a commodity is determined according to three laws...

1. The price of raw materials has to be covered in the selling cost.
2. The price of the labor-power, i.e. the wages, has to be covered.
3. Ideally, a profit would be nice for the capitalist. 

While factor (1) is merely a replacement of already-existing value, (2) and (3) consist of values taken from the new value created by the labor-power. Because of this, wages and profits are always in ratio with one another. Whenever relative wages rise, profits must fall. 

# The interests of capital and wage-labor are diametrically opposed: Effect of growth of productive capital on wages
Since a rapid growth of capital causes a rapid growth of profits, this can only mean a rapid decline in relative wages. 

If this rapid growth of capital causes real wages to rise, due to a decrease in the price of commodities, the material standing of the worker may have increased, but at the cost of their social position. The chasm between worker and capitalist grows ever wider. 

# In what manner does the growth of productive capital affect wages?
When productive capital grows, a capitalist may be able to produce a commodity for a cheaper price, either through increasing the scale of their production, or through a technological advancement that lowers the production cost directly. 

When this happens, they will sell the commodity for slightly cheaper than their competitors, in order to secure a wider slice of the market and make more profit. But inevitably, other capitalists will catch wind of this innovation, and will adopt it, lowering the average cost of production of the commodity overall.

When this happens, we're right back to square one, except now the productive forces are even more massive, and production is happening on an even larger scale with more investment into the [[means of production]]. 

# Effect of capitalist competition on the capitalist class, the middle class, and the working class
When this competition takes the form of increased scale, the end result is that the capitalist has to find a market for more and more of the commodity in question. This increases the struggle between capitalists to a more violent level than before. 

When this competition takes the form of a further division of labor within production, then one worker can now perform the work of ten or twenty. This means that competition between workers for work has incresed tenfold or twentyfold. 

This division of labor also reduces the skill involved in the labor, making it more and more robotic. This reduces the cost of production of the labor-power, reducing the wage paid to it. In this way, the work becomes more and more shitty, while also becoming less and less paid. 

Basically, capitalists in each industry are competing to see who can employ the fewest workers to produce the most. Naturally, this leads to whole legions of workers being put out of work at every advancement in the productive forces. Bourgeois economists say that these workers will find new work, or that at least the next generation of workers would find new work. 

Unfortunatley, this work must pay less than the old work. Since complex and difficult work is being replaced by easier and more mechanical work, the cost of production of the labor-power decreases, and therefore the wages decrease. 

This also holds true for those workers employed in the manufacture of complex machines. As the machines become more complex, you might think that the work to maintain them would become more complex, but this isn't true. Machines for the development and maintainance of the complex machines help this work to also become simpler and easier to learn over time, reducing the wages paid. 

Productive capital grows -> Labor is further divided, machinery is introduced 
-> Competition increases among the workers -> Average wages shrink

In addition to this, the increase in productive capital spells doom for the small capitalist. Since competition increases to greater and greater heights, with more and more investment in productive capital needed to compete, the petit bourgeois are priced out of the game, and must become proletarians. This further increases competition among the workers. 

Finally, this process also increases the devastation of the cyclical crises of overproduction, since the amounts of each commodity being produced increase, while the ability of the working class to afford these commodities decreases. These crises increase in violence and frequency.
