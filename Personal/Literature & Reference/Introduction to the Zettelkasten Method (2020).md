The author begins by informing us that the [[zettelkasten method]], or ZM, is an "amplifier of your endeavors in the realm of knowledge work." He says that it is highly effective, but requires effort to set up.

## Luhmann's Zettelkasten
Sascha explains that Niklas Luhmann was a social scientist who produced 50 books and over 600 articles. He says that Luhmann's productivity was powered by his Zettelkasten system. 

Sascha reveals that Luhmann's Zettelkasten was a collection of notes on paper slips that were linked together by numbers. He says that Niklas was able to surf such a system through its links, and engineered various starting points for this surf, but also says that we have the ease of digital tools, unlike Luhmann. 

## Why are we so interested in Luhmann's Zettelkasten?
Sascha outlines how we can improve the connectivity of our thoughts and become more productive using the ZM. He also says that we can stop wasting our efforts by saving scraps of knowledge for later, and tackle more complex problems by focusing on the problem at hand. 

He says that normal note taking creates bloat over time, unlike the ZM which scales itself to the size of the problem we are addressing. He also notes that the ZM makes our writing easier, more coherent, and more convincing. 

Sascha draws our attention to Luhmann's statement that it's important to be able to look back on notes later after you write them.

## The fixed address of each note
The author says if we want to refer to a past note, it has to have a fixed and unique address with which we can identify it. He says that we don't really have to worry about this in the digital age, but that Luhmann implemented this using a clever numbering system alternating between letters and numbers. 

In this way, the author informs us, Luhmann was able to chain notes together so that they could build off of each other and splinter off in multiple directions. 

The author asserts that this system had two conseqences that we should keep in mind: it made organic growth possible, and it makes linking possible. 

At this stage, Sascha brings up the concept of a search engine to enter the hypertext. He says that Luhmann used a register of important jumping-off points into his Zettelkasten. 

## A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing
The author outlines the most important traits of a Zettelkasten:
1. It's hyper-textual
2. It adheres to the *Principle of Atomicity*
3. It is personal

First, the author elaborates that it is not a single text or collection of texts, it is made of texts that refer to each other, explaining, expand on, and use each others' information.

Secondly, Sascha says that each note in a Zettelkasten needs to be *atomic.* By this, he means that each note needs to contain a single idea, as opposed to a Wikipedia article which he says contains many ideas. See more on [[atomic notes]]

Thirdly, the author encourages us to have a single Zettelkasten for ourselves, and not to share one between people. He says that we should view our ZK as a personal tool that represents our unique minds. 

## The anatomy of a Zettel
Sascha explains that an individual note, or a *Zettel,* has three components. He says we should look for a unique ID, the body of the note, and references at the bottom.

As he already covered, each note needs a unique ID. He states that these could be using the Luhmann-ID system, or time based, or an arbitrary unique string, or just the title of the note. 

As for the body of the Zettel, Sascha tells us that we should write this in our own words in order to increase our understanding of the idea rather than just copying it. In terms of the length of the body, he says that this is dependent on the purpose of our Zettelkasten, and that if we seek a web of thoughts, each Zettel should contain a single thought. 

The author argues that we should stick to *knowledge* rather than *information* in our notes. To him, information is static and "dead" while ideas build upon one another and can grow. 

Turning to the reference, Sascha explains that the sources of our information should go here. If we based the idea on a book we read, Sascha wants us to put the title of the book down here. 

## Structure notes
The author states that Luhmann needed some sort of additional structure besides the organic connections between notes, and used *hub notes* and a *register* to do this.

Sascha explains that the register as a list of central zettels that acted as diving in points. According to the author, the hub notes acted as zettels that listed multiple other places to continue the topic. 

## How to implement a Zettelkasten
The author starts by outlining the options for software. Then, he encourages us to just start now, and get to work building our network.
