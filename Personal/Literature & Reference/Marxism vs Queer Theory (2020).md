> This is an English translation of an article released by the Austrian section of the [[IMT]]. It discusses the differences between modern [[Queer Theory]], [[identity politics]], and ultimately [[postmodernism]], and the perspective provided by [[Trotskyism]].

The article means to argue that as Marxists, it is our role to fight fiercly against all forms of oppression, but it is also our role to study and understand the best way to actually accomplish this mission. In light of this, the author says, we need to cast a critical eye on the new wave of [[feminism]] that is gaining popularity, queer theory (PDF, p.1).  

## 1. What is Queer Theory?
Kipcak explains the origins of this theory in 90s [[academy|academia]], saying that the theory centers on the individual, where sexuality is seen as a focal point to understand society. She argues that this theory is loose and ill-defined, making criticism difficult as thinkers often choose not to commit to any established position (Ibid, p.1). This is very similar to [[postmodernism]]. 

Seeking to find commonalities between Queer theorists, the author outlines some points of agreement: gender identity as social fiction, this social fiction is produced by discourse which we ought to uncover and parody (Ibid, p.1).  

> Queer Theory explores how sexuality is being regulated and how sexuality influences and structures other social areas such as state policies and cultural forms. Its main concern is to deprive sexuality of its seeming naturalness and to make it visible as a cultural product entirely permeated by relations of power. (Jagose, 11, translated from the German)

## 2. Identity Crisis
Kipcak asserts that the gradual institutionalization of the womens' movement during the 70s, combined with the failures of revolutionary movements of the 60s, led to the domination of [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] ideas within the movement, replacing more radical currents that dominated the movement earlier. She argues that tendencies which obscured or outright erased class struggle became more and more popular. Instead of [[materialism|materialist]] analysis and struggle, she continues, the movement now focused on fighting against "transhistorical patriarchy" divorced from class analysis (Ibid, p.2). 

It was here, the author explains, that a central idea of Queer Theory began to emerge - that "woman" was a social category rather than a real one (Ibid, p.2). I actually agree with this position, and I don't think that it precludes holding a materialist viewpoint or rejecting the mistaken conclusions of QT. 

Here, the author introduces the parallel current of postmodernism, explaining that both tendencies ascribed power to language and deny objective reality. In terms of the strategic implications, the author remarks, the movement replaced struggle with resistance and collective strength with individualism (Ibid, p.4). 

## 3. The Philisophical Basis of the Gender Question
The author begins with a dive into Butler's reasoning for why gender has no material existence. Kipcak says that Butler attempts to reject the idea-matter dualism but falls squarely into [[idealism]] (Ibid, p.3). 

The article explains the importance of this problem, arguing that those who see ideas as fundamental rather than matter will have quite different notions of how to change the world, preferring language and educational efforts to class struggle and material improvements. The author says that Marxists take up the position of [[materialism]] (Ibid, p. 4). 

## 4. Subjective Idealism
Kipcak expands on how Queer Theory has foundations in idealism. She quotes Butler and other Queer theorists to support this claim. Summing up Butler's position, she says that the latter tells us that "every form of Being is simply an effect of discourses (language)" (Ibid, p.4-5). [[Idealists center discourse]] to their own detriment.

Kipcak points out that these views have consequences - if thoughts and reality are the same and all constructed by humans, then how are we to tell a good idea from a wrong one? She argues that such a view means that we cannot determine what views assist us in understanding the world, and what views do the opposite. She says that despite the fact that this approach to life is contradicted by our everyday experience, some really view it as a useful method of analysis (Ibid, p.6-7). I agree - [[Thought and activity are inseperable]], and [[Action verifies perception]]. 

# 5. Class society, oppression, and culture
The article argues that genders are related to more than biological functions, that they are embedded deep in our society, and furthermore, that culture itself is *not* arbitrary, but emergent from the material base of society (p7). In other words, [[Culture is downstream from economic basis]]. 

Kipcak goes on to explain that the oppression of women as a cultural phenomenon only emerged at the junction when private property relations were created on a basis of surplus product. She quotes [[Engels]], who notes that this was a *historical defeat* of the female sex. Importantly, she notes, this was not a *cultural* or *discursive* defeat (p7). 

Extending this point, the author argues that gender roles are not derived purely from the realm of ideas, but "spring from the material basis of class society," building on exploitation, oppression, and biological factors (p7). 

Explaining that this exploitation and oppression results in a backlash, Kipcak says that it's inevitable that ideological counter-attacks will become popular in the absence of an understanding of the material roots of these phenomena (p8). 

# 6. Materialism, science, and sex
The author begins by reminding us that under capitalism, science is infected with bourgeois interests and ideas. She argues that the shortcomings of a "metaphysical, mechanical materialism" have allowed Queer Theory a foothold in the debate (p8). 

Kipcak gives an overview of the dialectic between the particular and the universal, saying that in rejecting this dialectic, QT renounces the universal and "raises the individual and accident to the level of principle" (p9). I should write more about the [[The dialectic of particular and universal]]. 

> Human knowledge is not... a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve, can be transformed (transformed one-sidedly) into an independent, complete, straignt line, which then... leads into the quagmire...

# 7. The powerful discourse of power
Turning to an analysis of Queer Theory's idea of power, the author outlines how the concept of power that QT advocates was developed by [[Foucault]], who blamed the betrayal of the May '68 events in [[France]] by the [[PCF]] on "hyper-Marxism," and was evidently far from a Marxist (p10). 

According to Foucault, she continues, power penetrates all aspects of life and expresses itself in pairs of opposites that correspond to the oppressor and oppressed. We are told that Foucault's idea of power includes resistance as a product of power relations as well (p10). 

The author quotes Engels in [[Dialectics of Nature (1883)]], who says that thinkers often invent a new "force of nature" to wave away processes that we cannot understand. She argues that this is what's happening with the abstract idea of "power" in Foucault's thought and Queer Theory (p11).
