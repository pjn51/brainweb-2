# 8. Oppression
The author explains that [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] thinkers disliked society for its tranquilizing effect on people, and the tendency of it to force conformity onto those within it. He says that three thinkers examined oppressive structures within [[France]], [[Sartre]] who examined anti-Semitism, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who examined sexism, and [[Fanon]], who analyzed colonialism. These thinkers, he continues, wanted to engage with the world, and viewed philosophy in a way closer to [[Marx]] than to [[Hegel]]. 

## Anti-Semitism
Wartenberg says that the prevailing attitude towards anti-Semitism was that it was due to false beliefs about Jews, implying that education could solve the problem of discrimination. He says that was an inadequate explanation, since there are many ethnic groups that we may know nothing about, but whom we nonetheless treat as equals. 

The author tells us that Sartre views anti-Semitism not as a *lack* of understanding of the Jews, but as a positive stance that one has freely taken towards the entire world. Sartre believes, the author continues, that the anti-Semite, out of a fear of his own freedom, chooses to calcify himself in a hierarchy in order to feel part of a group. Therefore, he continues, Sartre says that the anti-Semite needs the Jew in order to feel superior within that hierarchy to somebody. In this way, [[Opposites require each other]]. 

Wartenburg describes Sartre's view of mediocrity. The author says that Sartre proposed that when a person enters a social group in order to deny their own radical freedom and responsibility, they embrace "mediocrity" - they are forced to fit in and not stand out too much. He thought, we are told, that this was a key aspect of bad faith ([[Sartre counterposed "bad faith" to authenticity]]). 

The author also describes Sartre's conclusion that the anti-Semite is reliant on the Jew, saying that without the Jew, the anti-Semite would cease to exist as anti-Semite, and that therefore, the latter must ensure the existence of the former. Sartre says that this exists in contradiction to the fact that the anti-Semite supposedly wants to eliminate the Jews from society. 

Noting the [[dialectics|dialectical]] nature of this situation, the author discusses the relationship between [[Hegel]] and the Existentialists. He says that they often attacked Hegel for his view of reality as rational, but nevertheless employed a lot of his ideas about the world.
