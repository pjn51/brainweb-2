[[Marx]] explains that labor *is not* the source of *all* wealth - nature is also a source of value. He says that it is only the application of labor to the correct raw material that increases [[use value]] and culture ([[Marx and Engels - Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy (1959)]], p112). 

Marx criticizes the Gotha Program for its call for "fair distribution" of wealth. He says that this term is far too loose, and is open to a large degree of interpretation. He prefers a more scientifically-founded demand (p115). He also says that focusing on the "distribution of the proceeds of labor" is focusing on a symptom rather than the main issue, which he sees as the mode of production itself (p120).

Marx also disagrees with the program's emphasis on the national German struggle, and he says that while the class struggle has to develop within the confines of given national situations, the working classes of each nation are bound together by a thousand threads (p122). 

Further on, Marx explains that calling for the full value of each worker's labor to be returned to them is actually a source of *in*-equality, since different workers have different capacities for labor, and different needs. He says that a truly just society would follow the maxim: "From each according to ability, to each according to need" (p119).

Turning to the question of the [[state]], Marx criticizes the calls for a "free state" in [[Germany]]. He says that this is a meaningless statement, and says that freedom is achieved when the state is actually made un-free, and is subjugated by the people (p126). Elaborating on this point, he says that the only state the workers' party should be calling for is the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], and he says that this is the only possible form of the state during the period of the revolutionary transformation from a capitalist society into a communist one (p127). 

Criticizing the program's call for universal, free education to be provided by the state, Marx says that there's a big difference between having standardized, professional education and education provided by the state itself, and he disagrees with any calls for the latter. He says that "government and church should rather be equally excluded from any influence on the schools." However, he does accept that the state sending inspectors to ensure standards are being met is different. Marx supported combining education and production instead (p130-131).
