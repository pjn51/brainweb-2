# Summary
Written by Lenin, this work of theory deals with the development of capitalism into monopoly capitalism, and the tendency for capitalism to expand in search of new markets. 

The basic idea is that [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]]. 

A lot of this book is about Lenin critiquing Kautsky.  [[Lenin criticised Kautsky's definition of imperialism]] and [[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]] that Kautsky put forward.

# Introduction to the 2014 edition by Alan Woods
[[Alan Woods]] introduces us to the new publication of this pamphlet. He says that this is the perfect time for a reprinting, as no book ever explained modern [[capitalism]] as well as this did. Woods argues that all of Lenin's predictions about the future of the global economy came true, from the domination of finance capital to the inevitability of imperialist war. 

## What is imperialism?
Woods argues that one could find "certain kinds of imperialism" in the pre-capitalist period of human history. He cites the [[Rome|Roman Empire]] as an example, saying that these glimpses of imperialism involve the conquest, enslavement, and plunder of foreign colonies. He says that this constitutes a primitive kind of imperialism, and cites Tsarist [[Russia]] as an example of this. 

However, Woods says that imperialism underwent a fundamental transformation under capitalism, and provides a definition by Lenin, where Lenin defined it as the monopoly stage of capitalism. Lenin outlines some fundamental features of imperialism, including the concentration of capital in the hands of the banks, the export of capital, and the territorial division of the whole world. 

## Concentration of capital
Woods cites [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]], saying that [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] predicted the movement from "free-market" capitalism towards monopoly, a theory which has withstood ferocious attack by bourgeois economists. He says that Lenin was further able to analyze this course of events, which he was able to see in detail during his lifetime. 

Woods turns to the present (2014) to provide some updated numbers. He says that the Forbes Global 2000 represents the 2000 largest companies, which employ 87 million people and own $159 trillion in assets. He cites that these companies generate $38 trillion in revenue annually, which amounts to 51% of global [[GDP]]. 

Woods notes the increasing prominence of Asia in this ranking. He says that the state-owned Industrial and Commerical Bank of [[China]] now has the #1 rank on the list. He also underlines the profitability of these companies, saying this list's firms in the [[USA]] generated $876 billion in profits in 2013. 

## The power of finance capital
Woods argues that Lenin's assessment, of the domination of finance capital having replaced the domination of capital in general, has held true. He cites the Forbes Global list of the 2000 largest companies, of which 469 are banks and 109 are insurance companies, the most well-represented category. 

Turning to the 2008 crisis, Woods says that the financial sector has grown even more powerful, having secured a record bailout to save them from their irresponsible drive for profits. He underscores that 77% of JPMorgan's net income came from government subsidies, demonstrating the ties between this sector and the [[state]]. He says this totally demolishes the lie of free competition on the market, and demonstrates that the only answer to the issues facing us today is to expropriate these criminals and run society on the basis of a socialist [[economic planning|planned economy]].

## Inequality
Woods explains how bourgeois economists protested at the Marxist prediction of the polarization of society under capitalism. However, he says that these projections have undeniable evidence. He cites *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* by Pikkety as evidence. While Woods notes that Pikkety is not a Marxist, he says that Pikkety's book received fierece criticism for daring to point out the fact that the rate of return on capital tends to be higher than the growth rate, inevitably leading to growing inequality. 

Woods explains that in a global population of seven billion, only around 2,000 people can be considered the highest rank of the elite, at a net worth of $6.55 trillion combined. He cites Oxfam's report that the richest eighty five people have more [[currency|money]] than the poorest 3.5 billion combined. 

Woods ties this into the political sphere. He says that over 80% of US Congress members are millionaires, and in order to become President, a candidate either has to be a billionaire or have the backing of several. In the [[UK]], he says, power has passed from Parliament to the Cabinet, and then to a clique of unelected bureaucrats, advisers, and experts around the Prime Minister. 

## Has imperialism changed its nature?
Woods discusses the fact that imperialism appears to have changed since the 1940s. In Lenin's day, he says, the division of the world between the main powers was literal, with military force used to explicitly reserve market segments for each group of national bourgeois. After [[WW2]], Woods says, the October Revolution had ushered in the world's first [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], and created a powerful impulse for national liberation movements around the world. The [[UK]] and [[France]] were weakened by the way, and the author outlines the process by which millions rose up against their colonial masters. 

However, Woods argues that these movements for independence didn't fully solve the problems that the colonized masses faced. In fact, he says, some isses were made worse. Of course, the author says that these movements were a giant step forward for the people of these countries, but the stranglehold of imperialism has a tighter grip on them now than it ever has.

The only real difference, Woods says, is that imperialism exercises domination through the mechanisms of world trade, foreign 'aid,' and interest on loans. He says that globalization forces ex-colonial countries to open their markets to a flood of cheap commodities, ruining local industry and draining their wealth. 

On the other side, the author explains, this same process compells the workers of these countries to work in slave-like conditions in the factories of multinational corporations to add more fuel for the engine of exploitation that powers this cycle. 

Woods turns to trade policy. He says that for every $1 [[Nigeria]] recieves in foreign grants and aid, it pays $1.30 on debt repayment! Continuing, he says Nigeria borrowed $5 billion and has payed $16 billion, but still owes $28 billion!

Woods says that in the current day, financial slavery is the modern state of international relations. He notes that in 1999, $128 million was transferred from the poorest countries to the richest due to debt repayments, *every day!* If debt had been cancelled for just 20 countries in 1997, Woods explains, that money could have saved the lives of 21 million children by the year 2000. That amounts to 19,000 children a day. 

Woods covers the Maquiladora system in [[Mexico]], and explains how it is a direct result of US financial domination. 

## Imperialism and war
...

# Preface to the Russian Edition
This pamphlet was first written by Lenin for publication under the Tsar. Therefore, it had to pass by censors and couldn't come out and say some things plainly. Lenin was forced to stick to irrefutable bourgeois sources and to beat around the bush a little bit. For instance, he made reference to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] since he couldn’t talk about European countries directly.

# Preface to the French and German Editions
## One
Lenin highlights that the conditions under which he created this work should demonstrate that Communists must make use of whatever conditions of legality can be found, even when there is severe censorship and oppression.

Lenin outlines all the ideas that he wishes he could include in this preface:

## Two
Lenin declares that this pamphlet proves that [[WW1]] was an imperialist war. He goes on to say that we can prove the social and class character of the war using bourgeois data. He points out that due to the complexity of the world, one can use isolated data points to prove any proposition, but says that we should use "... *all* the data on the basis of economic life in all the belligerent countries and the whole world."

To me, this seems like an incomplete solution to the problem of being buried in contradictory data, but whatever. 

Lenin outlines the sorts of data he includes in this work. He references the partition of the world, the distribution of the world's raliways. He says that the latter is important because it represents the culmination of multiple central industries of capitalism - steel, iron, and coal. He says that we can analyze railroads to get an outline of the development of world [[capitalism]], and says that the summary that these data provide demonstrate that imperialist war is inevitable *because* of the economic development of this system.

Lenin goes on to point out that "competition," "small business," and all the other buzzwords that the capitalists like were long gone by 1916. He says that capitalism has developed into a system of oppression on a global scale that has drawn the whole world into war over the division of the spoils. 

It's striking how similar the buzzwords of "small business capitalism" that the capitalists use today are to the phrases that Lenin demolishes, even in 1916. 

## Three
Lenin says that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the Treaty of Versailles have demonstrated a few things to the world. He says that they exposed the direct agents of [[imperialism]], as well as the petty bourgeois reactionaries and sham socialists who sang the praises of 'Wilsonism' and bourgeois pacifism as the war ended. 

Lenin connects the tragedy of the war with the [[class consciousness]] of the masses. He says that the terror of the war is revealing the terror of capitalism generally, and moving the world towards a global revolutionary crisis. He says that "however prolonged and arduous its stages may be," it will end in a proletarian revolution. 

I'm not sure if Lenin would have expected the stages to be *this* long and arduous. This pamphlet was written over 100 years ago. 

He ends the section by calling attention to the betrayal of world socialism by the [[Second International]], and says that their Basel Manifesto puts this in plain black and white. He says that they pledged to oppose imperialist war, and broke their promise. 

## Four
Lenin says that special attention has been given to critiquing [[Kautsky]] and his ideas. He says that the development of Kautskyism is a reflection of the decay of the Second International, and is the fruit of an ideology of the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. 

Lenin says that we cannot dispense with a fierce rebuttal of these ideas, since they're a total betrayal of [[Marxism]]. 

# I: Concentration of production and monopolies
It is clear to Lenin that the concentration of production is a constant trend under capitalism. He says this is demonstrated not only through the concentration of more and more workers per company on average, but the ever-increasing productivity of larger enterprises. 

He points out that this concentration easily arrives at monopoly or oligopoly, through agreements between the few large enterprises. He explains that firms can even grow to encompass multiple industries through vertical integration, in order to level out trade fluctuations and ensure a more steady rate of profit. 

Lenin claims that these patterns persist whether the economy is protected by high tariffs or not, although high tariffs accelerates this movement towards monopoly. 

He explains that this trend towards monopoly is also a trend towards the socialization of production, noting that [[economic planning]] is done by fewer and fewer groups as firms merge and acquire one another. Because of this, he concludes that economic planning of the whole society grows simpler by the year. 

This is one thing that really blew my mind when I first read it. [[socialism]] isn't a *total* break with the processes of capitalism, it's a continuation of the progressive trends to a higher stage, while the negative elements are abandoned.

Lenin says that in 1916 [[USA]], 0.9% of firms contribute 38% of GDP. Today, 0.1% of US firms contribute 60% of US GDP, showing the intensification of this trend in the years since Lenin wrote this. 

> Production becomes social, but appropriation remains private. The social [[means of production]] remain the private property of a few. The general framework of formally recognised free competition remains, and the yoke of a few monopolists on the rest of the population becomes a hundred times heavier, more burdensome and intolerable.

This is a really interesting concept to me. This contradiction of social production and private appropriation is the central contradiction of capitalism. 

> The statement that cartels can abolish crises is a fable spread by bourgeois economists who at all costs desire to place capitalism in a favourable light. On the contrary, the monopoly created in certain branches of industry increases and intensifies the anarchy inherent in capitalist production as a whole.

Lenin points out that this increasingly socialized production actually doesn't get around the insanity of the market, and can actually intensify the disconnect between different industries. 

An example that jumps to my mind is OPEC. The petrol cartel manipulates the market to increase its own profits, sending the rest of the economy into disarray sometimes. This whole section is just about the tendency towards monopoly. This tendency is accelerated by tarrifs, and capitalist crises that destroy small businesses and allow large firms to step in to get the market share. 

# II: Banks and their new role
Lenin explains that the primary role of banks is to act as middlemen that assist in payments of one group to another. He says that this function transforms inactive money [[capital]] into active [[capital]]. Lenin points out that as banks grow in power and size, they can become functional monopolies of their own due to the sheer amount of [[capital]] they control. 

It seems to me that the real purpose of the banking system is to more efficiently allocate [[capital]]. Unused [[capital]] in one industry is loaned to capitalists in another industry for investment. This also means that as the economy expands and becomes more complex, the role of the bank increases in prominence. While monopollistic firms may control a whole industry, a monopolistic bank controls all industries by controlling the overall flow of [[capital]].

Lenin points out how tightly the banks really control the whole economy. He says that banks can accelerate or hinder the growth of whole industries based on their [[credit]] policies towards individual firms. 

It seems to me that the situation is even more centralized in the hands of the banks today. Lenin points out that "a tiny stratum" of the working class stores its wealth in banks, but now the majority of all workers in the advanced countries do. And cash itself is being supplanted by electronic means of payment, directly controlled by the banks. This is a further continuation of the centralization of *all* capital, no matter how small the individual piece is, in the hands of the banks. 

Interestingly, Lenin points out that the [[stock market|Stock Exchange]] is no longer a vital tool in [[capital]] circulation like it once was. He says that the Stock Exchange was the indespensable regulator of free market capitalism, and the waning of its power reflects the movement from free competiton towards monopoly capitalism.

I suppose he means that companies no longer rely on the stock exchange for financing their operations, and instead this institution is mainly used for speculation.

> Thirty years ago, businessmen, freely competing against one another, performed nine-tenths of the work connected with their business other than manual labour. At the present time, nine tenths of this ‘brain work’ is performed by employees.

Lenin also calls our attention to the relationship between the banks and [[state]]. He says that seats on the supervisory boards of the large banks usually contain members of the state bureaucracy. The inverse also seems true to me. State financial advisors and members of the Cabinet often go on to have lucrative careers as members of the financial elite after their term runs its course.

Lenin also remarks on the increasing expetise and specialization of the banks. He says that they now employ whole departments of analysts to predict and forecast economic activity. 

To conclude this section, Lenin remarks that this stage of capitalism - marked by monopolies in both banking and industry, and increasing intervention of financial institutions in all industries - represents a transition towards something. It is clear to me that he means socialism in the long run. As the whole of the economy organically becomes planned by smaller and smaller circles of firms and boards, we can see that there is a natural next step towards planning of the *entire* economy, *in the interests of alll of humanity.*

# III: Finance capital and the financial oligarchy
Lenin points to a bourgeois definition of finance [[capital]] as [[capital]] controlled by the banks and employed by industrialists. Lenin says there is a key point missing here: it fails to account for the presence of monopoly. 

Lenin makes fun of the inability of bourgeois economists to really understand the forces at work. He says that they hide their confusion behind phrases that praise the 'sense of duty' of bankers in regards to their industrial investments. Lenin thinks that this is proof they have no real idea of what is really going on, and even if they did they would never expose it. 

Lenin notes that as companies go public and have their ownership divided among many shareholders, this actually increases the power of the larger interests, rather than leading to a democratiziation of capital. He says that this is because a large investor needs only to hold 40% of the shares in a company to have de facto control over its affairs, because small shareholders will find it harder to organize amongst themselves and attend meetings. In this way, Lenin points out that large investors can increase their dominion over twice the amount of capital than the capital that they themselves control. 

Lenin explains that we can rely on bourgeois sources to look at the financial oligarchy because it's so obvious that even they can detect it in some countries. He points to a variety of tricks that firms use to make more money and sneak around their shareholders, such as the setting up of subsidiaries and shell companies. 

In country after country, Lenin outlines the makeup of the financial oligarchy. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, he explains that the large banks there are often in partership or outright owned by banks in the imperialist countries. 

He also explains how in economic downturns, the banks seize the opportunity and buy up failing businesses and restructure them, importing [[capital]] when needed to get them going again. 

Lenin says that capitalism is characterized by a separation of the *ownership* of [[capital]] from the *application* of [[capital]]. He goes on to say that under the imperialist stage of capitalism, this separation becomes vast. He explains that there was is now a giant gap separating the real controllers of [[capital]] from the firms that apply the [[capital]], the managers of which are themselves distant from the workers who create value. 

Lenin applies this observation internationally, saying that there are now a few capitalist countries that are generally exporting [[capital]] - the [[UK]], the [[USA]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]. 

# IV. Export of capital
Lenin calls attention to the trend away from the export of commodities towards the export of capital, and says that today we see an enormous surplus of capital in the advanced countries. 

Turning to what he calls a petty bourgeois argument, Lenin says that capitalism couldn't simply re-invest this surplus in improving living conditions, because then it wouldn't be capitalism - since capitalism requires uneven development and the "semi-starvation level of existance of the masses."

Under these conditions, Lenin says, the opportunity for exporting capital develops. According to Lenin, cheap land, labor, and materials in underdeveloped countries allow the capitalists to increase profit at a rate not found at home, as long as the backwards countries have the basic infrastructure for development. 

Lenin also notes that the export of capital speeds up the development of capitalism in the places where it is exported. 

Turning to the political angle, Lenin says that countries often recieve loans from international finance, on the condition that a part of the loaned money is spent in one host country or another. 

# V. Division of the world among capitalist associations
Lenin describes how the division of the home market inevitably bleeds into the division of the world market by capitalist associations and international conglomerates. 

Lenin notes that in some cases, the capitalists have pushed for *state control of industry,* in order to force the state to take the expense of revitalizing failing industry. Notably, this is the same process that [[Ted Grant]] describes happening in the [[UK]]! 

Lenin attacks the notion that the formation of international associations could be a path to the end of warfare under capitalism. He reminds us that these military struggles have an economic basis, and that no matter what *form* the economic conflict takes place, the *content* of it is unchanged. 

> The capitalists divide the world, not out of any particular malice, but because the degree of concentration which has been reached forces them to adopt this method in order to obtain profits. And they divide it ‘in proportion to capital’, ‘in proportion to strength’, because there cannot be any other method of division under commodity production and capitalism.

# VI. Division of the world among the great powers
Lenin notes that at the time, the world had finally been divided completely between capitalist powers, such that the only possible method of expansion for any one of them would be through war. 

He also underlines how during the period of "free competition" in Britain between 1840 and 1860, bourgeois opinion was seeming to turn *against* a colonial expansion, but as the UK entered more and more into the imperialist epoch, the capitalists got back on board with strict control of the colonies. 

Lenin quotes Cecil Rhodes, who outright said that imperialist expansion was needed to prevent the class war at home, and to find markets for the commodities produced domestically.

He adds that while even pre-capitalist states practiced imperialism, the colonial policy in the era of finance capital is unique because it has the presence of large associations of employers.

He also explains that the export of capital gives an impetus to military control, since it's easier to implement monopolist methods when you can back it up with military force. However, he also tells us that some countries find themselves so totally dependent on another country that military force isn't directly required, and monopolist control can be exercised through financial instruments.

# VII. Imperialism as a special stage of capitalism
 Lenin points out that capitalism became capitalist imperialism at a stage where its features began to turn into their opposites. He says that free competition, the hallmark of the development of capitalism, developed into monopoly, its opposite. 

[[Lenin defined imperialism around financial domination]]. He also says that imperialism occupies a specific contextual relationship to the other stages of capitalism. 

[[Lenin criticised Kautsky's definition of imperialism]]. He also criticizes those who say that imperialism is progressive. 

[[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]]. 

# VIII. Parasitism and decay of capitalism
[[Lenin called imperialism parasitic]]. Monopoly leads to stagnation, as there is no incentive to invest in research or new production. Large firms may even purchase patents in order to prevent new technology from upsetting the dynamic of their industry. 

Investors profit off the labors of colonies in a fundamentally parasitic way, generating no value of their own. In this way, imperialism is a parasitic arrangement. 

“The world has been divided into a handful of usurer states and a vast majority of [[credit|debtor]] states.”

[[Lenin explained that imperialism strengthens opportunism]]. The super-profits of imperialism allow the ruling class to bribe the upper strata of the working class, strengthening opportunist currents. However, the growth of these super-profits has begun to slow as the whole of the world has now been partitioned by the Great Powers. 

Land in the usurer states is gradually being taken out of productive use, as more and more economic activity is transferred to the colonial states.

# IX. Critique of imperialism
Lenin says that the networks of dependencies created by finance capital bind the propertied classes of the whole world to the imperialist project. 

Lenin also advises us that imperialist ideology can penetrate the working class, and says that many [[reformism|Social Democrats]] of his day had such a sickness, and this disease has existed for some time before them. 

Discussing the veiled support for imperialism by the academics, Lenin notes that cynical imperialists who bluntly defend the system are rare, with most supporters choosing to hide the real nature of imperialism by submerging essential facts below surface-level details. 

He attacks a bourgeois report that says since imperialism is essential for capitalism, no hope can be made in challenging imperalism. He says that such an argument is an attempt to go backward, allay the antagonisms of the current epoch, and is cowardly. 

Turning to the [[petty bourgeoisie]], Lenin says that their opposition to imperialism is rooted in such a desire for the past. He crticizes Kautsky and the [[SPD]] for failing to oppose this tendency, and actually becoming merged with it in practice. He says that as long as this tendency refuses to admit the connection between the political and economic aspects of imperialism, it will always remain a "pious wish."

Lenin describes the views of some representatives of this trend, who counterpose the previous period of free competition to the imperialist stage of capitalism. At the same time, Lenin says, these bourgeois say that the international nature of finance means war is impossibly unprofitable. 

Lenin begins a more detailed attack on Kautsky's central critique of imperialism. He says that Kautsky broke with Marxism by advocating a return to "peaceful democracy," which Lenin believes represents a move away from a confrontation with capitalism and towards the smoothing-over of contradictions. He's basically saying that [[Things change through contradiction]], and we ought not to shy away from the clash of antagonisms under capitalism.

# X. The place of imperialism in history
1. [[Competition leads to monopoly]]

---
Monopoly is the transitional stage from capitalism to a higher order. It can only arise out of a high degree of concentration of the productive forces, seizure of the important sources of raw materials by the cartels, the development of the banking system, and colonial policy. 

The monopoly stage sees the exploitation of more and more colonial or semi-colonial states by fewer and fewer rentier or usurer states. The political differences between these rentier states fade into the background as all are united in their economic position. 

The large profits brought by imperialism make it possible for the capitalists to bribe certain sections of the workers in order to delay the class struggle. 

Even bourgeois economists talk about the interlocking of the banks with other industries, with the growth of banking beyond the realm of purely private business regulation, but they pretend this does not prove the Marxist theory of the socialization of production under capitalism! They’ve missed the forest for the trees.
