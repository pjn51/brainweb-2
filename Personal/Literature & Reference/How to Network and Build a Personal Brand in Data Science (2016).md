Roger begins by saying that at Springboard, they have lots of resources on how to break into the [[data science industry]]. He says that once we are skilled and have a strong portfolio, the next step is to [[networking]] with those who can help us leverage our skills into a job.

Roger explains that since many job opportunities aren't posted publicly, it's important to build a network in the field. 

## Finding a mentor
The author remarks that finding a mentor to guide us has a lot of value. He adds that most people don't understand that mentorship is a two-way street, and that we are creating value for our mentor, either through giving them a fresh perspective or some other way. He says that the golden rule of relationships is that you get what you recieve. 

## Meetups and conferences
The article lists some popular meetups and [[data science]] conferences that are good to attend in order to build our professional network. 

The author also says that meetups exist for specific subgroups, like interest or tool-based get-togethers. 

## Other ways to network
Roger says that there is a good community of data scientists on Twitter, and there are good podcasts and newsletters to follow, such as *Partially Derivative,* *Talking Machine*, and others.
