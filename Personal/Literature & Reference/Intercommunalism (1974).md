The foreign policy of the [[USA]] runs counter to the philosophy of [[liberalism]]. This can clearly be seen in the Vietnam War, where the US opposed a government whose founding documents made reference to the Declaration of Independence and followed the same ideological lines, at least initially. 

This contradiction can be explained by analyzing the interests of the US ruling class, which weilds immense power compared to the ruling classes of the past, such as the feudal aristocracy. They weild this power through investment decisions, which affect the lives of millions and billions of people, and through the state apparatus. They use the state power indirectly, because it is political suicide to challenge the capitalist system due to the unpopularity of economic decline, which the ruling class would be sure to instigate if the state attempted to challenge their interests. 

This ruling class has interests that span the globe, and due to the unrest of the 20th century, began to enter more and more directly into management of these interests, no longer able to trust local representatives. This was the case in Vietnam, and in all the places where the CIA and American-backed regimes took power during the Cold War. 

The ruling class also ensures the reproduction of capitalist ideology through its control of the means of ideological and cultural production. These include universities, [[media]], and other such institutions. This culture, once established, has a momentum all its own. Even politicians who see through the bullshit are compelled to 'play the game' because to go against the dominant way of doing things is to make enemies at the highest level. 

The main mission of this capitalist ideology is to tie together all the values of American society (the 'American way of life') to the preservation of private property, and the system of so-called 'free enterprise.' As we Marxists know, the system of capitalism will die if it ceases to expand, so an effort is also made to ensure that the preservation of this way of life is tied up in ensuring that it is continually expanding to all corners of the globe. 

This expansion is framed as the exportation of [[capital]] from the rich world to the poor, but in reality, the opposite process is happening. Investments are made in the poor countries, but all the profits are absorbed by the rich, widening the international divide. In fact, this relationship stops the development of the poor countries, instead of accelerating it like the bourgeois theorists claim. Instead of profits being reinvested in the local economy like they would under internal capitalism, the profits are moved out of the country, with only a portion of them being reinvested in the local economy at best. 

The Black Panther Party has chosen a materialistic view of the world, as opposed to an idealistic one. This is an arbitrary choice, because we can't really be sure that the world actually exists. Until that time where scientists can prove that the world has a material basis, we have to make this assumption without proof. 

> [!Criticism]

We add dialectics to this materialist outlook, and arrive at the revolutionary philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]]. This is the outlook of the BPP, but they don't claim that it can always be applied, you have to look at the specific case. 

The BPP studies the ideas of [[Marx]] and [[Engels]], not becuase they worship these figures, in fact they say that Marx was probably a racist based on the way he described Black people in his work. Instead, they study the method of [[Marxism]]. 

> [!note]
> IDK about this point but I also agree with the fundamental argument he's making.

## A short history of the BPP
When they began in 1966, they were Black nationalists. They saw that the Black population was facing oppression, and that historically, the way out of that situation was the formation of a nation that could defend itself. 

After a while, they began to see issues with this idea. It was much harder to form a nation in 1966 than it was in 1066. To become a nation, they would need to become dominant in an existing nation. However, it was their lack of dominance that compelled them to seek nationhood!

This caused the BPP to develop into revolutionary nationalists. They thought the Black communty could unite with other oppressed people and therefore become dominant and capable of creating a nation for themselves. Due to the need to ally with those outside of the Black community, they began to call themselves internationalists. 

However, they began to question their assumptions about what problems becoming a nation would really solve. In the past, nations had enough security from foreign influence that they could develop themselves in a number of cases. That was not so for the modern nation. Troops could be deployed by the US anywhere in the world in a matter of days. 

This meant to them that the [[USA]] was no longer just a state, it was an empire. It was similar to the [[Rome|Roman empire]], but there was a difference in capabilities. The Roman empire was very powerful regionally, but didn't have the ability to control the entire Earth the way that the US empire could. 

This total degree of colonization that the US had subjected the world to meant that there were no longer 'colonies.' For something to be a colony, it must be possible to decolonize. That was no longer the case due to the permanent dependence on the system of international capitalism that the poor countries had installed in them. 

Therefore, nations couldn't really exist independently anymore, and making a new nation didn't really make sense. This led to the BPP redefining itself from a nationalist organization to a communal one. They were now revolutionary intercommunalists. A community is different from a nation, because a community is a smaller unit.

> [!Criticism]
> This distinction doesn't seem clear cut at all. It lacks the clarity of a class analysis.

The BPP sees that a revolutionary alliance of these communities could have the power to restructure society without capitalist [[imperialism]]. They say that there are already a number of 'liberated zones,' areas free from the control of the US empire: China, [[North Korea]], and North Vietnam. 

The stage is set for a 'global revolutionary intercommunalist' revolution. There will still be contradictions after this revolution, as there will be even after communism. 

*Note: the concept of intercommunalism seems to be similar to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in function.*

The real role of the BPP was to raise the [[class consciousness]] of the oppressed in order for them to realize who their enemy really was, and enable them to expropriate the capitalists. 

>Dialectics would make it necessary to have a universal identity. If we do not have universal identity, then we will have cultural, racial, and [[religion|religious]] chauvinism, the kind of ethnocentrism we have now.

But why don't we have a universal identity among the oppressed? Why do some members of the oppressed identify with the ruling class? We have to look at their material lives. Many 'reactionary' workers are also suffering under capitalism. Just as a child seeks independence from their father while also having the urge to remain under their father's care, so too does the oppressed masses have contradictory urges when it comes to the ruling class. 

The future revolutionary thrust will be born out of the current situation. As Huey Newton sees it, the development of the productive forces will make workers less and less needed in production. Automation will create an ever-growing class of unemployed, unemployable people across the world. 

As this growing class of unemployables (the [[lumpenproletariat]]) grows, they will radicalize into a revolutionary force. 

> [!Criticism]
> I disagree with this economic analysis. The issue is that a population of consumers is just as essential to capitalism as a working class is. Even though automation could put many out of work, that would cause a collapse of capitalism due to overproduction of [[commodities]]. These crises of overproduction would result in a small resetting of the process of automation.

The BPP proclaims that Black Americans are the international vanguard of the lumpenproletariat. Black Americans are natural internationalists because they were moved to the US by slavery and don't feel as much of a connection to the country in the way that peasants in Russia did, for instance. 

> [!Criticism]
> I think the connection of the peasants to the land wasn't a psychological one, but a condition borne of material circumstances. In the same way, I think many Black Americans consider themselves as Americans despite their ancestry, because they have the same material position as White Americans, in terms of their role in production.

Newton says that the existance of a black bourgeoisie is an illusion, that they don't really control anything. The mission is to work among them as well, to point out their real interests as Black people. 

> [!Criticism]
> I strongly disagree with this. Oprah has the same class interests as any other billionaire, despite her race. As for the Black petit bourgeoisie, they are revolutionary to the same extent that the whole petit bourgeoise is.

The BPP began a community education program, called the Ideological Institute. It taught about 100 lumpens the basics of dialectics, math, science, and physics. 

The arrival of communism will usher in not only changes in the mode of production and the mode of exchange, but psychological changes as well. No longer will humans have to compete with one another for survival. 

# My thoughts 
I think this analysis is pretty good, but there are some major issues. It isn't really clear to me why the Black Panthers were a black-only organization based on these ideas. If you're going to purposefully exclude the majority of the population from your revolutionary organization, there better be a good reason to do so. 

If their analysis was that the white working class, or rather the white lumpenproletariat that they think is revolutionary, didn't have a high enough level of consciousness, then there's no reason to exclude white people from membership. *All* members should have a high level of political consciousness, so if white people meet the mark they should be admitted. 

As for the emphasis on the lumpenproletariat, I don't think this analysis has proved correct in the long run. The workforce participation rate in 1974 was 61.3%. In 2019, it was 63.2%. We haven't seen the growth of the lumpenproletariat like Huey Newton predicted, at least in the United States. 

As Marx points out in his economic works, capitalists need a market of consumers to soak up their commodities, and if there aren't enough consumers who can afford the commodities, then the [[means of production]] will be destroyed in an economic contraction until the mass of commodities can be absorbed by paying consumers. 

This means that the lumpenproletariat cannot grow to the size where it would be a revolutionary force, and there are also other issues with the lumpenproletariat as a revolutionary class. It doesn't have as much natural class solidarity, as many of its members are transient or have issues with drugs or mental health. This isn't their fault, but it's just a fact.
