# 1. Dialectical materialism
...

## Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of classical German philosophy (extract) - Engels
See [[Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy (1888)]] for the full text. 

[[Engels]] says that when [[Marx]] separated from [[Hegel|Hegelian]] [[philosophy]], he did not abandon the teacher's revolutionary side, and instead freed the revolutionary potential of Hegel from its prison of [[idealism]] (PDF, p70). In effect, [[Marx inverted Hegel's dialectic]]. 

Continuing, he says that they took a [[materialism|materialistic]] view, reducing [[dialectics]] to the "science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and human thought" (p70). 

On the topic of antitheses, opposites, Engels says that this view frees the thinker from the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view, and allows one to understand that [[Opposites require each other]] (p71). 

Elaborating on the metaphysical view, Engels cites Hegel's explanation of it, saying it relies on investigating fixed, stable, and thus dead phenomena. However, he continues, this method had its justification in its day, and it was necessary to first investigate things before processes could be understood (p71). 

## The three sources and three component parts of Marxism (extract) - Lenin
See [[The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism (1913)]] for the full text. 

[[Lenin]] says that the opponents of Marxism always seek to dethrone materialism, ultimately replacing it with a [[religion|religious]] view (p71). 

The advance of Marx, Lenin continues, was that he carried the conclusions of materialism through to their end - the materialist analysis of human society (p72). 

Lenin describes [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]], saying that the various political forms serve the purpose of defending [[capitalism|capitalist]] society (p72). 

## On the question of dialectics 
Lenin argues that the splitting of a single whole and the analysis of its [[contradiction|contradictory]] parts is the essence of the dialectical method (p72). 

Explaining [[The dialectic of particular and universal]], Lenin says that the individual only exists in connection to the universal, and the universal only exists in the individual and *through* the individual (p74). 

Lenin attacks "metaphysical materialism," even defending idealism, which he says is merely a one-sided, exaggerated inflation of one of the aspects of knowledge (p74). 

Continuing, Lenin says...

> Human knowledge is not... a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve can be transformed (transformed onesidedly) into an independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is anchored by the class interests of the ruling classes). Rectilinearity and one-sidedness, woodenness and petrification, subjectivism and subjective blindness â€“ voila the epistemological roots of idealism. And clerical obscurantism (= philosophical idealism), of course, has epistemological roots, it is not groundless; it is a sterile flower undoubtedly, but a sterile flower that grows on the living tree of living, fertile, genuine, powerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge (p75). 

## Questions on dialectical materialism

# 2. Historical materialism
## What is historical materalism? - Alan Woods
[[Alan Woods]] argues that the scientific method allows us to undestand history as a process rather than a series of unconnected events (p79). 

Continuing, he criticizes bourgeois science for getting less and less scientific the closer it gets to analyzing society (p79). [[Bourgeois science refuses to analyze society]]. 

Turning to an analysis of objectivity, Woods argues that [[Taking a stance doesn't rule out objectivity]], giving the example of a surgeon who accurately analyzes the patient, regardless of his or her interest in the latter's survival (p79). 

Woods quotes Marx, who explains the relation between the individual and history. The latter says that individuals make their own history, but not as they please. Rather, he continues, they make it according to the historical options provided to them (p80). Essentially, [[Marxism isn't deterministic]]. 

Woods explains that [[evolution]] is not linear, and instead, [[Evolution follows a pattern of punctuated equilibrium]]. He applies this to an analysis of history, outlining the place of wars and revolutions that interrupt the gradual progress that liberals worship (p82). 

The author argues that [[Labor productivity reflects social process]], and is in fact the driving factor in social development. He says that a recognition of this fact is the difference between the scientific socialism of the Marxists and the utopian ideas of [[Owen]], [[Fourier]], and others (p84). 

Criticizing the alternatives to materialism, Woods says the only other option is a theory of great men and great ideas that fall from the sky. He says this is an idealist and subjectivist view of reality (p84). 

Returning to a discussion of base and superstructure, Woods notes that these forces can be contradictory at times, and ideas that deserve to persish can linger for longer than they ought in peoples' minds and habits (p85). [[Forms can outlive their usefulness]]. 

Citing Marx's analysis of historical societies, Woods explains that it would be overly mechanical for us to find economic reasons for every single cultural quirk of ancient societies (p85). 

Woods says that most people don't like change, and will only alter their understanding of reality if forced to by events (p86). Basically, [[Human consciousness is conservative]] and [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]]. 

Woods turns to an analysis of the emergence of humanity, saying that anthropologists wrongly assumed that the size of the brain was the distinguishing factor in early humans, where it was really our upright stance that allowed us to use tools and provided a *justification* for the increased resources going to our brain (p86-87). The essence of this is that [[We're only as intelligent as we need to be]]. 

When it comes to human nature, Woods says that children are intentionally molded to reflect the values of their society (p90). 

Coming to [[the Neolithic revolution]], Woods explains that this was the first great revolution in the mode of production, where agriculture allowed the emergence of class society, which was somewhat progressive in that it freed a section of the population to pursue more complex activities, such as art, science, and culture (p92). 

Continuing, he says that the result of this was the emergence of more available metals such as iron, which revolutionized production as well as warfare (p93). 

He argues that during this period, we see the first evidence of [[alienation]]. He says that private property alienated the laborers from their products, the [[state]] alientated them from control over their lives, and organized [[religion]] alientated them from their very souls, which were property of the priest (p94). 

Briefly touching on the [[the Asiatic mode of production]], Woods says this dead-end way of organizing society was put down by colonialism (p96). He continues, saying that Marx never spent much time or effort analyzing this mode of production, since it was a dead end unlike [[feudalism]] (p96). 

Turning to [[slave society]], Woods says the main division was, of course, between slaves and free people. He argues that while we can say slavery was morally abhorrent, we must avoid [[moralism]] and admit that the advances of society were only possible by passing through a phase of slave society (p97). He says that we owe all the wonders of modern science from the groundwork laid by the oppression of slave by master in [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] (p98). 

However, he notes, all modes have their epoch of decline, and slavery was no exception. He explains that slave labor is only productive when there are large numbers of slaves because of their individual low productivity. Because of this, he says, massive supplies of slaves were needed which couldn't be born, as slaves had low birthrates in captivity, leading to a need for permanent expansion that we saw in the Roman Republic (p98). 

Woods argues that the efforts of Gracchus (to divide the wealth of Rome among the free citizens) would have provided the only escape, and his defeat, along with the defeat of [[Spartacus]], were the death warrant for Roman society (p98). 

Woods says that Spartacus failed because of an inability to unite with the [[lumpenproletariat]] in the towns, who were unproductive freemen living off the welfare of the state (p99). 

He returns to his analysis that [[Forms can outlive their usefulness]], saying the Roman Empire bled for generations as it declined into ruin, leading to a general atmosphere of despair, within which the doctrine of [[Christianity]] bloomed as old religions lost credibility (p100).

Explaining that [[Necessity is expressed through accident]], Woods outlines the barbarian invasion that ultimately toppled the western Roman Empire (p100). 

He concludes the discussion on Rome, noting that the defeat of Rome threw back the advance of human thought for a thousand years, with the cities destroyed or abandoned, and their technolgy with them (p101).
