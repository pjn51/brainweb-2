# 1. Dialectical materialism
...

## Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of classical German philosophy (extract) - Engels
See [[Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy (1888)]] for the full text. 

[[Engels]] says that when [[Marx]] separated from [[Hegel|Hegelian]] [[philosophy]], he did not abandon the teacher's revolutionary side, and instead freed the revolutionary potential of Hegel from its prison of [[idealism]] (PDF, p70). In effect, [[Marx inverted Hegel's dialectic]]. 

Continuing, he says that they took a [[materialism|materialistic]] view, reducing [[dialectics]] to the "science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and human thought" (p70). 

On the topic of antitheses, opposites, Engels says that this view frees the thinker from the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view, and allows one to understand that [[Opposites require each other]] (p71). 

Elaborating on the metaphysical view, Engels cites Hegel's explanation of it, saying it relies on investigating fixed, stable, and thus dead phenomena. However, he continues, this method had its justification in its day, and it was necessary to first investigate things before processes could be understood (p71). 

## The three sources and three component parts of Marxism (extract) - Lenin
See [[The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism (1913)]] for the full text. 

[[Lenin]] says that the opponents of Marxism always seek to dethrone materialism, ultimately replacing it with a [[religion|religious]] view (p71). 

The advance of Marx, Lenin continues, was that he carried the conclusions of materialism through to their end - the materialist analysis of human society (p72). 

Lenin describes [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]], saying that the various political forms serve the purpose of defending [[capitalism|capitalist]] society (p72). 

## On the question of dialectics 
Lenin argues that the splitting of a single whole and the analysis of its [[contradiction|contradictory]] parts is the essence of the dialectical method (p72). 

Explaining [[The dialectic of particular and universal]], Lenin says that the individual only exists in connection to the universal, and the universal only exists in the individual and *through* the individual (p74). 

Lenin attacks "metaphysical materialism," even defending idealism, which he says is merely a one-sided, exaggerated inflation of one of the aspects of knowledge (p74). 

Continuing, Lenin says...

> Human knowledge is not... a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve can be transformed (transformed onesidedly) into an independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is anchored by the class interests of the ruling classes). Rectilinearity and one-sidedness, woodenness and petrification, subjectivism and subjective blindness â€“ voila the epistemological roots of idealism. And clerical obscurantism (= philosophical idealism), of course, has epistemological roots, it is not groundless; it is a sterile flower undoubtedly, but a sterile flower that grows on the living tree of living, fertile, genuine, powerful, omnipotent, objective, absolute human knowledge (p75). 

## Questions on dialectical materialism

# 2. Historical materialism
## What is historical materalism? - Alan Woods
[[Alan Woods]] argues that the scientific method allows us to undestand history as a process rather than a series of unconnected events (p79). 

Continuing, he criticizes bourgeois science for getting less and less scientific the closer it gets to analyzing society (p79). [[Bourgeois science refuses to analyze society]]. 

Turning to an analysis of objectivity, Woods argues that [[Taking a stance doesn't rule out objectivity]], giving the example of a surgeon who accurately analyzes the patient, regardless of his or her interest in the latter's survival (p79). 

Woods quotes Marx, who explains the relation between the individual and history. The latter says that individuals make their own history, but not as they please. Rather, he continues, they make it according to the historical options provided to them (p80). Essentially, [[Marxism isn't deterministic]]. 

Woods explains that [[evolution]] is not linear, and instead, [[Evolution follows a pattern of punctuated equilibrium]]. He applies this to an analysis of history, outlining the place of wars and revolutions that interrupt the gradual progress that liberals worship (p82). 

The author argues that [[Labor productivity reflects social process]], and is in fact the driving factor in social development. He says that a recognition of this fact is the difference between the scientific socialism of the Marxists and the utopian ideas of [[Owen]], [[Fourier]], and others (p84). 

Criticizing the alternatives to materialism, Woods says the only other option is a theory of great men and great ideas that fall from the sky. He says this is an idealist and subjectivist view of reality (p84). 

Returning to a discussion of base and superstructure, Woods notes that these forces can be contradictory at times, and ideas that deserve to persish can linger for longer than they ought in peoples' minds and habits (p85). [[Forms can outlive their usefulness]]. 

Citing Marx's analysis of historical societies, Woods explains that it would be overly mechanical for us to find economic reasons for every single cultural quirk of ancient societies (p85). 

Woods says that most people don't like change, and will only alter their understanding of reality if forced to by events (p86). Basically, [[Human consciousness is conservative]] and [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]]. 

Woods turns to an analysis of the emergence of humanity, saying that anthropologists wrongly assumed that the size of the brain was the distinguishing factor in early humans, where it was really our upright stance that allowed us to use tools and provided a *justification* for the increased resources going to our brain (p86-87). The essence of this is that [[We're only as intelligent as we need to be]]. 

When it comes to human nature, Woods says that children are intentionally molded to reflect the values of their society (p90). 

Coming to [[the Neolithic revolution]], Woods explains that this was the first great revolution in the mode of production, where agriculture allowed the emergence of class society, which was somewhat progressive in that it freed a section of the population to pursue more complex activities, such as art, science, and culture (p92). 

Continuing, he says that the result of this was the emergence of more available metals such as iron, which revolutionized production as well as warfare (p93). 

He argues that during this period, we see the first evidence of [[alienation]]. He says that private property alienated the laborers from their products, the [[state]] alientated them from control over their lives, and organized [[religion]] alientated them from their very souls, which were property of the priest (p94). 

Briefly touching on the [[the Asiatic mode of production]], Woods says this dead-end way of organizing society was put down by colonialism (p96). He continues, saying that Marx never spent much time or effort analyzing this mode of production, since it was a dead end unlike [[feudalism]] (p96). 

Turning to [[slave society]], Woods says the main division was, of course, between slaves and free people. He argues that while we can say slavery was morally abhorrent, we must avoid [[moralism]] and admit that the advances of society were only possible by passing through a phase of slave society (p97). He says that we owe all the wonders of modern science from the groundwork laid by the oppression of slave by master in [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] (p98). 

However, he notes, all modes have their epoch of decline, and slavery was no exception. He explains that slave labor is only productive when there are large numbers of slaves because of their individual low productivity. Because of this, he says, massive supplies of slaves were needed which couldn't be born, as slaves had low birthrates in captivity, leading to a need for permanent expansion that we saw in the Roman Republic (p98). 

Woods argues that the efforts of Gracchus (to divide the wealth of Rome among the free citizens) would have provided the only escape, and his defeat, along with the defeat of [[Spartacus]], were the death warrant for Roman society (p98). 

Woods says that Spartacus failed because of an inability to unite with the [[lumpenproletariat]] in the towns, who were unproductive freemen living off the welfare of the state (p99). 

He returns to his analysis that [[Forms can outlive their usefulness]], saying the Roman Empire bled for generations as it declined into ruin, leading to a general atmosphere of despair, within which the doctrine of [[Christianity]] bloomed as old religions lost credibility (p100).

Explaining that [[Necessity is expressed through accident]], Woods outlines the barbarian invasion that ultimately toppled the western Roman Empire (p100). 

He concludes the discussion on Rome, noting that the defeat of Rome threw back the advance of human thought for a thousand years, with the cities destroyed or abandoned, and their technolgy with them (p101). 

# 3. Marxist economics
## What is Marxist economics? - Rob Sewell
[[Rob Sewell]] first dives into the question of value. He explains that Marxists discuss two kinds of value: [[use value]] and [[exchange value]], often used interchangeably with "value." He tells us that something has a use value if it satisfies a human desire, and it's exchange value measures what other commodity it can be exchanged with (p.124). 

Explaining the [[labor theory of value]], Sewell says that the primary argument is that "labor is the source of all value. Human beings can only live and satisfy their basic needs through labor, the production of use-values" (p.125). I agree that the LTV is valid, but this seems like a circular argument: "labor is the source of all value since we have to labor to generate use-values."

Turning to [[commodities|commodity]] exchange, the author says that this is based on equivalent exchange. That means, he continues, that no value is generated through commodity exchange, since either the commodities have equal value (no transfer of value from seller to buyer), or one agent is losing the value the other gains. He also notes that in order to be exchangeable, every commodity must have something in common: labor (p.125).

Now we dive into the way that value is quantified in a commodity. Sewell explains that value is expressed relative to the value of different producers in society. He says that because of this, value is not the result of one form of labor or another, but labor in general, labor in the abstract (p.126). I'm not sure what he's saying here, perhaps that exchange value is only possible due to generalized commodity exchange in society?

Now, we examine price and its relationship with exchange value. Sewell argues that prices are determined by production cost and are mainly reflective of the average labor-time needed to produce them. He says that this is a combination of living labor and dead labor ([[capital]]) (p.127).

Sewell describes changes in price, saying that when a new innovation allows a capitalist to produce commodities with less than the average amount of labor time, they're able to make super-profits, until their competitors adopt the same technique and the average labor-time needed to produce the commodity decreases (p.127). 

The author says that this process is mirorred in the question of investments per industry. He explains that if an industry demonstrates higher-than-average rates of profit due to new technology or supply and demand, capitalists in neighoring industries will begin to invest their capital in the more profitable industry, competing and thus lowering the rate of profit back down to the average (p.128).

Avoiding a mechanical conception of price and labor time, Sewell explains that commodities rarely sell at their exact exchange value, but orbit around that value like how the tides fluctuate around sea level. He argues that in this way, the law of value works as the basic regulator of price under capitalism (p.128). 

Sewell now turns to some of the interesting cases related to the difference between wealth and exchange value. He notes that a good harvest increases the wealth of a country, but will not change the sum of exchange values unless an unusually high amount of labor was expended. Instead, the exchange value of any one unit of crops would decrease in the same proportion as their number increased (p.129).

Furthermore, he says that Marx didn't say that exchange value was the *only* thing determining price. Sewell argues that Marxists accept the role of supply and demand acting upon prices. Also, he says, worthless things are bought and sold, as well as things like forest land, which no labor has been expended on improving. He says that these distortions are a result of speculation and monopoly, but do not disprove the rule (p.129).

Despite the role that supply and demand do play, Sewell says, bourgeois economists fail to see that this is only one factor. He says that while scarcity or glut can move prices, they can only do so within a certain range. He argues that there's no situation where a tractor would be cheaper than a loaf of bread, for instance. He attributes this to the fact that a tractor has much more labor-time invested in its production, and thus fetches a higher price than a commodity with less labor-time invested, regardless of supply and demand. He demonstrates this by explaining the process of capital flow, where an industry fetching higher than average profits will see greater investment, competition, and thus prices will lower back towards equilibrium (p.130). 

Sewell now criticizes the proponents of marginal utility theory. He says that these thinkers are totally subjective and [[idealism|idealist]] when it comes to price mechanisms, saying that price is dependent only on the utility to the individual buyer. Sewell agrees that different buyers have different needs, but asks how a commodity can be sold at a specified price regardless of the individual buyer. Thus, he argues, out of an accumulation of "subjective utilities" we find an objective exchange value (p.131).

The author points out that under [[feudalism]], exploitation was very visible - the [[peasantry|peasant]] works his or her own plot for a time, and then goes to the lord's plot and works for free there. He says that under capitalism this division is invisible, and occurs silently during the workday (p.131). 

However, Sewell directs us to [[Marx]]'s analysis, which he says demonstrates that exploitation does happen under capitalism. He explains the difference between labor and [[labor|labor power]], saying the latter is the ability of the worker to work rather than the product of work itself (p.131).

Turning to a discussion of wages, he says that [[The social wage flows from class struggle]], as well as other factors (p.131).

Now we turn to a few useful equations to differentiate forms of [[capital]]. The author explains the difference between constant and variable capital and says total capital can be regarded as:

$$
c+v+s
$$

Where $s$ represents the [[surplus value]] generated by variable capital ([[wages]]) (p.132).

He continues, saying that [[The rate of exploitation is the ratio between surplus value and wages]], or variable capital (p.133). 

Sewell also explains that [[Capital flows in a M-C-M' circuit]] (p.133).
