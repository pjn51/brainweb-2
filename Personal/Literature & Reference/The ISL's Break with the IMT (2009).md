*This is an article by the ISL about their split with the IMT over the question of national liberation vs socialist revolution.*

The author outlines that the ISL split from the [[IMT]] after a lengthy debate on the conflict between Hamas and the [[PLO]] in [[Palestine]]. The author goes on to say that in a process spanning less than three months (lengthy?), the group, then known as the In Defense of Marxism Circle (IDMC), transformed from committed IMT supporters to fierce critics. 

The author asks how such a transformation could occur. The author claims that in the minds of "centrist and [[reformism|reformist]] leftists," the IDMC had been a Trojan horse for the [[SWP (USA)]]. The author claims that the IMT's explanation was less conspiratorial "but no less dastardly," in that the Israeli Marxists had crossed the class line and supported Islamic fundamentalism.

It is the author's intention to prove that the main cause of the split was the "pro-imperialist" position taken by the IMT on the question of Palestine. The author claims that this was exacerbated by the "cult-like, anti-democratic" nature of the IMT. The author goes on to accuse the IMT of engaging in Popular Frontism in [[Pakistan]] and [[Venezuela]], and accuses the International of being composed of heterogeneous sections with different programs. 

## A naive beginning
The author says that the conflict between [[Hamas]] and Fatah was over in June 2007, with the ousting of the last of the Fatah forces from the Gaza Strip. They say that less than a year had passed since [[Israel]] went to war with [[Lebanon]]. The author says the IDMC took the position that Lebanese Marxists should fight alongside the Lebanese resistance, a position that they say was supported by the international leadership of the IMT and [[Lenin]], as quoted from his work, *Socialism and War (1915)*.

The author quotes Lenin:

> For example, if tomorrow, Morocco were to declare war on France, India on England, Persia or China on Russia, and so forth, those would be “just,” “defensive” wars, irrespective of who attacked first; and every Socialist would sympathize with the victory of the oppressed, dependent, unequal states against the oppressing, slave-owning, predatory “great” powers.

> [!criticism]
> I will note here that Lenin isn't saying that socialists should support the bourgeoisie in Morocco, just that we would "sympathize" with the workers there.

The author also quotes [[Trotsky]], who they say shared a similar position:

> We do not and never have put all wars on the same plane. [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] supported the revolutionary struggle of the Irish against Great Britain, of the Poles against the Tsar...To speak of "revolutionary defeatism" in general, without distinguishing between exploiter and exploited countries, is to make a miserable caricature of Bolshevism...

The author says that the IDMC drew the conclusion that in a struggle between an [[imperialism|imperialist]] state and "an oppressed people," "...Marxists are duty-bound to support the oppressed as long as the oppressed side is not controlled by another imperialist power." The author goes on to say that in the case of the civil war in Gaza, Marxists must take the side of Hamas for this reason.

> [!criticism]
> I think this is totally bullshit reasoning. Yes, Marxists must take the side of the oppressed, but Hamas does *not* represent the interests of the oppressed in Palestine! The author is forgetting that even within an oppressed nationality, there are multiple layers at work, with multiple different class interests. Hamas represents the class interest of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] in the Palestinian population, not the working class!

The author says the IDMC were shocked to hear that the IMT disagreed with this latest position. They say that the editors of Marxist.com began to make revisions and edits, and the author claims that the IMT's argument against supporting Hamas was that the situation in Lebanon was different since the Israeli army was fighting directly, while in Palestine the Israelis did their work through Fatah.

## What changed in a year?
The author begins to outline the formation of a split between the Israeli IDMC and the IMT. They say that at a world conference of the IMT... "we were constantly lied to and had promises of support from the IMT leaders broken." 

The author claims that the IMT is an organization built upon the premise that the global [[proletariat]] has no faith in Marxism. The author claims that this means that the IMT's perspective is that we have to work within the parties of [[reformism]] until one can "convince enough party members to become revolutionaries." The author claims that this represents an deviation towards [[opportunism]] from Trotsky's proposed [[entryism]] tactics.

The author says that such entryism is mostly futile, and requires that revolutionaries enter and support reformist parties, sowing illusions in those parties and filling the revolutionary organization with left reformists and party bureaucrats.

The author claims that when this happens, these elements will come to dominate the entryist group and eventually merge with the bureaucracies of the reformist parties directly. They claim that this has happened in the [[UK]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and Pakistan. 

The author says they can explain the IMT's "ambivalence" on the Gazan civil war from the standpoint that the IMT serves western imperialism. They say this is why the IMT supported Lebanon against Israel, and why it refused to support Hamas. I'm not sure that I understand the point that the author is making here. 

The author also claims that IMT was feeling pressures to turn sharply to the right, which the IMT supposedly did the next year.

## The first crack
The author claims that the IDOM editorial board at first refused to publish the article supporting Hamas under false pretenses, and then finally caved in, publishing a heavily edited one. The author says things cooled down for a while until the next World Congress in 2007. 

At this World Congress, the authors claim that they were barraged by members of the IMT, who had been informed by their leaders that the IDMC wanted to fully support Hamas, which the authors state they did *not* want to do. 

The author assert that during the Congress, [[Alan Woods]] misused the example of the [[Ireland|Irish]] civil war, saying that revolutionaries shouldn't take a side in such conflicts. The authors say that this was false because the Irish Communist Party fought in the civil war on the side of the nationalists. 

The authors say that they began to suspect that the IMT had degenerated after the death of [[Ted Grant]], and they use the conduct of the Pakistani section as evidence of this. The authors claim that the Pakistani IMT entered into backroom negotiations with the PPP, which they say is a bourgeois party. 

## The ideological and organizational split
Upon returning from the conference, the author explains that the IDMC had some internal debates about Israel and now Venezuela. The author says that the leader of the IDMC, Schwartz, gave a speech at the Congress calling for the exposure of Chavez' government as a counter-revolutionary one, and that this was met with applause by the rank-and-file of the Congress, to the surprise of the author.

> [!criticism]
> If I recall correctly, this is the IMT position on Chavez, so I'm not sure how this proves that the IMT is imperialist or something.
> Also, how do they justify not supporting Chavez in his "anti-imperialist" struggle against the [[USA]]? They support fucking Hamas!

The author outlines how another of their leaders, Stern, theorized that the IMT had degenerated after the success of [[Militant]], the pressures of which led Grant to adopt a supposedly opportunistic line, leading to the "pro-imperialist" positions of the IMT on Israel. 

The author elaborates on the line of thinking advocated by Schwartz. They say that he noticed that all the groups which thought of the [[Russia|USSR]] as somewhat progressive or proletarian had taken an "opportunistic" stance on Israel / Palestine, and that this meant that the seed of this opportunism must lie in that theory. 

The author continues, saying that it was this "empiric conclusion" that led the ISL to break with the IMT and adopt a state capitalist position on the USSR. The author also outlines the current ISL position on Israel, that the Israeli workers are "aristocratic because of the colonialist nature of Israel, and only the struggle of the Arab workers can lead to a change of consciousness among a minority of the Jewish workers." 

The author also explains that the ISL also rejected the theory of proletarian [[Bonapartism]] since, in their mind, it led to support for [[Stalinism]] as a progressive force. They say that this was a clear revision of Trotsky's conclusion that Stalinism was a counter-revolutionary tendency within the workers movement, just like [[reformism|social democracy]]. 

Furthermore, the authors assert that the idea of proletarian bonapartism leads to the conclusion that any radical petty bourgeois force could carry out a proletarian revolution. 

The authors say that the IMT offered them a deal at this time. In their words, the IMT would allow them to publish their opinion on the IDOM website, and would allow all the members to come to their own conclusion. The authors say that the ISL had come to the conclusion that the IMT was secretly plotting to participate in a future PPP government in Pakistan, and was using their position on Islamic fundamentalism as a smokescreen to justify the "suppression of Muslim insurgencies by American imperialism." 

According to the author, when the ISL refused to remove this from the article, the IMT expelled them. The author goes on to say that shortly afterward, an article "supposedly" written by the Moroccan section of the IMT came out criticizing their position "more in the style of a cheap yellow rag than that of Marxist polemics."

## Conclusion
The authors admit that the ISL is still a small organization, and say that their critics blame their small size on their flip-flopping or their sectarianism. But the authors claim that these people are ignoring the role of ideas when judging a group, focusing only on their size. They ask revolutionaries to look not at their size, but at the changes they have gone through over time. 

Explaining their analysis of solidarity in Israel / Palestine, the authors say that there are material reasons that the Jewish and Palestinian workers don't feel solidarity with one another. They admit that there have been many historical cases of workers in imperialist countries uniting with oppressed workers, but say that the fundamental difference is that the workers in Israel are descendants of settlers who have expropriated the Palestinians from their land. The authors claim that as long as Jewish workers continue to feel that they have an interest in maintaining the Zionist state, there can never be solidarity between Israeli Jews and Palestinians.

> [!criticism]
> I would say that some parts of this argument are correct. Solidarity is eroded when the Jewish workers feel that they have an interest in maintaining Zionism. For instance, they might feel that way if they hear that they are a "settler" who benefits materially from Zionism, or when the leadership of the Palestinian movement, Hamas, is outright calling for the killing of Jews and indescriminately shooting rockets into their cities. That means that the role of socialists isn't to *support* these divisions, to deepen them, but to cut *across* them and attempt to forge unity, no matter how difficult it may be.

> As of 2008, there were 5.5 million Jews in Israel / Palestine, and only 3.6 million Arabs. That means that if the ISL is correct, and only an insignificant minority of the Jewish workers can be won to the cause, then revolution is impossible in Israel, and Zionism has already won. Why then, does the ISL even bother organizing?
