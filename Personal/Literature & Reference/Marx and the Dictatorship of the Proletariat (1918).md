[[Martov]] delves into an analysis of what [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] thought about the [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|dictatorship of the proletariat]], and whether or not they were influenced by [[Blanquism]]. 

He quotes [[Kautsky]], who says that indeed, these thinkers did have elements of Blanquism in their early conception of the DotP. Marov disagrees, saying that while Marx and Engels recognized the Blanquists as revolutionary representatives of the proletariat, that isn't to say they were influenced by Blanquist ideology. 

Instead, Martov argues that M&E were influenced by the tradition of [[Jacobins|Jacobinism]]. He continues, saying that Marx and Engels envisioned the seizure of power by the [[vanguard]], which through involvement of the [[proletariat]] in the workings of the [[state]], would raise the latter to a higher level of consciousness. However, Martov argues that this conception changed later on towards an idea that the masses must be conscious of their own struggle and involve themselves directly. 

Martov argues that while M&E recognized that the workers could seize political power before the conditions for socialism were ripe, they believed that since political domination flows from economic domination, that this victory would be transitory, and would represent a "phase in the bourgeois revolution." 

Martov believes that this means we should not judge the maturity of a society for socialism based on the fact that the proletariat is technically capable of seizing political power. It's clear that this is a critique of the [[Bolsheviks]], who had seized political power less than a year earlier. 

Martov goes on to argue that the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] does *not* mean the political domination of the workers over *all* other classes, and instead means the political coalition of all the "healthy parts of society" against the old ruling class. He uses the Paris Commune as an example, saying that while the workers did hold political control of this state apparatus, it was due to the consent of the majority, and support by large layers of the peasantry and middle classes. Again, this seems like an indirect criticism of the Bolsheviks, who supported political supremacy of the workers *over* the peasantry more and more as the civil war intensified into the 20s. 

> [!My conclusion] 
> I wish that Martov was a bit more direct in his criticism of the way that the Bolsheviks were handling the situation. I think he has some interesting points, but he also fails to see the bigger picture. He argues that Russia is not mature for socialism without addressing the prospect of an international revolution, at a time where that seemed closer to inevitability than impossibility. Regardless, I would find it useful to read through this with Jake at some point and discuss.
