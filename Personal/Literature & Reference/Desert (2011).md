*This is an anonymous publication dealing with 'eco-nihlism.'*

## Forward!
The author asserts that a spectre haunts many activists in the anarchist community. This spectre is one of nihlism, the idea that the world cannot be saved. The author asserts that this is probably true, which seems like a big assertion that will hopefully be explored more deeply. 

The author also asserts that this realization shouldn't become debilitating unless one assumes that the struggle is all-or-nothing, that either the world will be destroyed or will become a utopia. In fact, the author goes on to claim that the real issue is the illusion that "a Big Happy Ending" is possible, which sets the stage for disillusionment.

The author asserts that anarchists should be able to find purpose and meaning in smaller struggles, despite the fact that they accept the world as a whole cannot be saved through global revolution. I would say this depression is a uniquely anarchist phenomenon. In fact, they are right in a way. The world cannot be saved *through anarchist struggle*, only through an analysis using the methods of [[Marxism]] can the revolutionary vanguard find a solution and a way forward.

## No (Global) Future
### Religious myths: progress, global capitalism, global revolution, global collapse
The author engages in a history of [[Anarchism]] and [[Marxism]] that is deeply, deeply tinged with [[idealism]]. They claim that anarchism was burdened with "Euro-Christian origins" that inserted ideas about a coming cataclysm, and that Marxism is nothing but "...a radical version of the enlightenment belief in progress — itself a mutation of Christian hopes... Following Judaism and Christianity in seeing history as a moral drama, that’s last act is salvation.”

The author seems to dive head first into [[postmodernism]], taking up an attack on the idea of "progress" in general, and the inevitability of the defeat of capitalism. 

### I love us, there's so much we can do and be, but there are limits
The author calls attention to the fact that while the anarchist movement has pockets sprouting up here and there, there are not enough anarchists to remake the world, and never will be. This perspective shows the differences between Marxists and anarchists in terms of approaches to revolution. While Marxists believe in the strength of the working class, anarchists only view anarchists as the revolutionary force that must topple capitalism. No wonder there's a spectre of nihlism!

The author attempts to fortify the above claim by saying that there is little historical evidence that the working class is predisposed towards "libertarian or ecological revolution." I would agree, since the idea of a 'libertarian' revolution is absurd. Furthermore, an 'ecological' revolution during an earlier historical phase than late capitalism would be anti-scientific, and would represent humanity moving backwards in its development. 

Building off this nihlism, the author claims that the best we can hope for is to expand tiny pockets of resistance around the edges of authority. 

### From anti-globalisation to [[climate change]]
The author points to three main tendencies in the movement around climate change. There are the Greenpeace types, who use [[direct action]] as a lobbying and fundraising strategy. The second tendency is made up of those who mobilize around specific campaigns with no attempt to link them together. Thirdly, there are 'nostalgic anti-capitalists' who want to recreate the dead anti-globalization movement. 

The author criticizes this third trend for creating a sense of false hope in the ability to approach broad changes through mass cooperation. The author claims that there "is no global singular future and no imaginary community, either of states or 'multitudes' can stop climate change." This is a clear rejection of revolution in general, as well as another clear point of support for postmodernism.

To be fair, the author nuances this point on a global future. They say that there will be areas of the world where civilization contracts painfully, but also areas where humanity settles more heavily than before. 

## It's Later Than We Thought
### Observed climate change is faster than expected
The author cites Lovelock, an environmentalist who claims that the world is now on an unchangeable path towards a warming state. 

The former chairman of the IPCC has said that we must prepare for the possibility of 4C warming. This would trigger the expansion of hot deserts, a decrease in overall arable land in some areas and an increase in the northern and southern extremes, and a massive die-off of both humans and other species. 

### Ghost acres feed population overshoots
The author now turns to the question of population. While the author admits the spread of birth control having a negative impact in terms of birth rates, they claim that the human population will still double in their lifetime (1970 to ~2050). However, the author claims that we may have *already* overshot the carrying capacity of Earth. 

The author points to the concept of *ghost acreage* in the form of fossilized fuel sources, that allow us to live off the agricultural output of the past in order to produce as much as we do today. The author criticizes those that claim technology will be able to get us out of this situation as members of a cargo cult (see [[Cargo Cult Science (1974)]]) in their belief that since technology has worked so far, that it must work forever. 

This seems like a valid argument, or at least a worrying one. However, their next argument is easily defeated. They claim that even if this was true, the highly managed nature of resources under this sort of system would rapidly decrease the "freedom supply," whatever that fucking means.

Without reliance on new technology to soften the blow, the author claims that decarbonization would be devastating to the quality of life of millions of people. They point to the millions who are already hungry, whose numbers would undoubtedly increase if the availability of hydrocarbon based fetilizers was restricted.

The author claims that it would be "utopian" to eradicate hunger from the human condition. To this I would ask, what of the communities that have already done so to one extent or another? While there was still inequality in places like the USSR, there was no hunger apart from specific historical periods early in that state's history. 

### Climate change brings possibilities as well as closure
The author rejects the narriative of the global collapse which will wipe out the state and all of society. However, the author thinks that the coming collapse may decrease the possibility of a global capitalist system that "encloses all relationships within it." To this, the author ties the cultural expansion of the West, on which the anarchist movement rides. 

The author claims that this forecloses the possibility of a unified world Anarchism. However, they see a possibility for the emergence of "many new/old worlds." and many anarchies to go along with them. This reeks of academic smoke and mirrors. What does it mean to counterpose a unified world Anarchism to many local anarchisms? If anarchism is not a unified set of ideas, or a unified method, what is it? 

## Desert Storms
### The military looks to the future
The author turns to the threats to [[state]] that climate change will bring. The author highlights the many issues that the states of the world will face, from communication difficulties to increased migration to the failure of some states outright. 

### Hot wars and failed states
