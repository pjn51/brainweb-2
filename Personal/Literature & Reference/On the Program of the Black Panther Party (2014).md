When this article came out, the killing of Mike Brown had rekindled protests against police violence. The need for sober, Marxist analysis was evident. 

In 2008, the IMT published a lengthy document, titled *Black Struggle and the Socialist Revolution.* It dealt with the source and material basis for racism, and explained that racism wouldn't disappear with the election of Obama, as bourgeois analysts reported. 

A real analysis of the uprising in Ferguson, and, I might add, the later events in  [[June 2020 uprising]], require a class analysis that penetrates beyond the surface of police violence, and actually asks why these phenomenae exist. 

## "Divided We Stand"
Racial tension, along with tension between genders and sexualities, and between religions, is kept alive by the environment of scarcity that capitalism causes. When there's not enough to go around, one may turn to their neighbor in fear of them taking what little one has. 

The working class and youth have a natural instinct for unity, and this can be seen in the demonstrations against police violence. 

The suffering of Black people in the [[USA]] is self-evident. However, suffering alone does not a revolution make. The masses need to have clear goals and tactics, and need to be welded together into a real organization to take power. 

This organization also needs to learn from the lessons of the past, so as to not make the same mistakes. 

## The [[Black Panther Party]]
The beginning of the BPP can be traced to the moment when [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] met in Oakland in 1961. They were frustrated by the lack of direct anti-racism and anti-police brutality activity in the local socialist scene. 

They decided to form their own group, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. They released a 10-point program in 1966. 

At first, the party was an eclectic mix of Black Nationalism, anti-imperialism, [[Marxism]], [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and many other currents. Within the party, tactical orientation ranged from [[ultraleftism]] to deep seated [[reformism]]. These differences were deliberately stoked by the [[FBI]], who sent agents in to provoke internal disagreements. 

However, the BPP was evolving in a positive, revolutionary direction. They shifted away from Black Nationalism towards Marxism. But it was not immune to the conditions it found itself in. It was deeply affected by [[Stalinism]], Maoism, and the severe repression that the state heaped onto it. In the final analysis, a revolutionary organization needs to be prepared for all of the external things that will beset it. The issue with the Black Panthers was their lack of a coherent program that armored it against such attack. 

## The Need for a Revolutionary Party and Program
The real trick for revolutionaries is to be clear about the program. Reformists will have the upper hand until we're deep into a revolutionary situation, and we cannot wait for the tide to turn before we start to build a leadership capable of guiding the masses to victory. We have to start doing so before the masses are at all revolutionary in outlook. 

This all starts with the program of the party. The program is the [[DNA]] that determines the development of all further growth. This program must be bold and clear enough to win the masses, but flexible enough to understand that there are multiple phases that the party must grow through, and countless material variables that will change throughout this process. 

This program must connect the numerically small force of Marxists with the advanced layers of the working class. It must also correctly determine what concrete steps must be taken to overthrow capitalism. 

This is a lot to ask from a few pages. 

## The Program of the Black Panther Party
> 1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our black and oppressed communities. We believe that Black and oppressed people will not be free until we are able to determine our destinies in our own communities ourselves, by fully controlling all the institutions which exist in our communities.

This meets the requirements for boldness and vision, but has some unscientific details. The framing of the issue in terms of the "black and oppressed *communities*" blurs the class lines within these communities. A Black homeless person doesn't have the same interests as a Black business owner. 

In any community, it is the upper layers who control the direction and voice of that community. To frame the issue in terms of community power is to hand over control to the ruling strata of that community. 

This demand also fails to leverage the united interest of all workers, even those outside the Black community and the very poor. Black Americans constitute around 13% of the population. Like it or not, they need allies outside that community if they want to challenge a force as powerful as the state. 

This error was realized to some extent by some of the leaders later on, but it is indicative of a serious error in the political theory of the Panthers, and we cannot afford to make this same mistake again. 

> 2. We want full employment for our people. We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to give every person employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if the [[USA|American]] businessmen will not give full employment, then the technology and [[means of production]] should be taken from the businessmen and placed in the community so that the people of the community can organize and employ all of its people and give a high standard of living.

The Panthers are on the right track here, with the same mistakes as the previous point. The emphasis needs to be on class unity, and that's the place where the Panthers find little to say. Instead, their emphasis is again on the community, which leaves room for interpretation. 

There is also some confusion where the Panthers say that the US government is obligated to guarantee a standard of living. As Marxists, we should be emphasizing that the bourgeois state *will never* and *can never* provide these things. It is run by and for the capitalists, and can't even overcome the contradictions of capitalism, much less provide for the needs of humanity. Anything else is providing fertile ground for [[reformism|reformist]] illusions.

> 3.  We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists of our black and oppressed communities.We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and two mules were promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave labor and mass murder of Black people. We will accept the payment in [[currency]] which will be distributed to our many communities. The American racist has taken part in the slaughter of our fifty million Black people. Therefore, we feel this is a modest demand that we make.

The idea that capitalists are robbers is a technical error in terms of economics. These may seem to be mere technicalities, but these sorts of things are crucial to get right when it matters and the stakes are high. They must be worked out beforehand. 

The demand for a one-time cash influx to repay Black people for slavery is olbiously reformist and non-revolutionary. This cash would immediatley concentrate into the hands of a small layer of black bourgeoisie, who would be the only ones to truly overcome the legacy of exploitation out of this situation. Instead, they would have the privelidge of being the exploiters! 

Furthermore, this demand would split the working class, since the capitalists would undoubtedly make the workers pay for such a restitution. Therefore, we would actually be worse off than where we started. 

The only truly effective and permanent way to pay reparations for the horror of slavery is the ending of capitalism, and creating a world without exploitation. 

> 4. We want decent housing, fit for the shelter of human beings. We believe that if the landlords will not give decent housing to our Black and oppressed communities, then housing and the land should be made into cooperatives so that the people in our communities, with government aid, can build and make decent housing for the people.

The basic thrust of this demand is just, but it lacks specificity. The question of "community" is still inprecise, and introduces confusion about which class will control these resources. The call for cooperatives isn't as revolutionary as a call for social ownership of housing.

> 5. We want decent education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present-day society. We believe in an educational system that will give to our people a knowledge of the self. If you do not have knowledge of yourself and your position in the society and in the world, then you will have little chance to know anything else.

This demand is pretty good, but could be *a little* bit more concrete. For example, the IMT demands the waiving of all fees and tuition, as well as increasing funding to all schools and loan forgiveness. 

> 6. We want completely free healthcare for all Black and oppressed people. We believe that the government must provide, free of charge, for the people, health facilities which will not only treat our illnesses, most of which have come about as a result of our oppression, but which will also develop preventive medical programs to guarantee our future survival. We believe that mass health education and research programs must be developed to give all Black and oppressed people access to advanced scientific and medical information, so we may provide community ourselves with proper medical attention and care.

What is the benefit here of asking for healthcare for Black people specifically, instead of calling for free healthcare? We need to let go of the moralizing instinct of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] and ask what the most direct route to revolution is. 

> 7. We want an immediate end to police brutality and murder of Black people, other people of color, all oppressed people inside the United States. We believe that the racist and fascist government of the United States uses its domestic enforcement agencies to carry out its program of oppression against black people, other people of color and poor people inside the United States. We believe it is our right, therefore, to defend ourselves against such armed forces and that all Black and oppressed people should be armed for self defense of our homes and communities against these fascist police forces.

Police brutality and militarization is fundamentally an expression of weakness. As the working class has grown in size and strength, more and more technology is needed to keep us under control. 

Another essential tool of the ruling class is their tactics of division. They stoke hatered in all its forms in order to confuse and weaken the workers. 

The Panthers had every moral right to walk through their communities armed to the teeth in order to defend themselves against police violence. But again, we're in the revolution business, not the moralizing business. Was this the best course of action? Or did this sort of thing accelerate the process of all the Panthers getting murdered? 

Small armed groups cannot substitute themseleves for the working class. This sort of thing tends to further isolate the group from the masses, making the work of justifying repression easier. 

As for the use of the term [[fascism]], that's a whole other story. Marxists cannot play fast-and-loose with terminology. To do so degrades the scientific nature of Marxism and sets us up for mistakes that decrease the confidence the working class will have when looking to Marxism for an alternative. 

> 8. We want an immediate end to all wars of agression. We believe that the various conflicts which exist around the world stem directly from the aggressive desire of the United States ruling circle and government to force its domination upon the oppressed people of the world. We believe that if the United States government or its lackeys do not cease these aggressive wars it is the right of the people to defend themselves by any means necessary against their aggressors.

This is a great point! 

> 9. We want freedom for all Black and oppressed people now held in U.S. federal, state, county, city, and military prisons and jails. We want trials by a jury of peers for all persons charged with so-called crimes under the laws of this country. We believe that the many Black and poor oppressed people now held in United States prisons and jails have not received fair and impartial trials under a racist and fascist judicial system and should be free from incarceration. We believe in the ultimate elimination of all wretched, inhuman penal institutions, because the masses of men and women imprisoned inside the United States or by the United States military are the victims of oppressive conditions which are the real cause of their imprisonment. We believe that when persons are brought to trial they must be guaranteed, by the United States, juries of their peers, attorneys of their choice and freedom from imprisonment while awaiting trial.

This point is fundamentally calling for the bourgeois rights supposedly afforded to us to be carried out. A Marxist program should go farther, and call for the end of capitalism, not for the honest carrying out of capitalist policy. 

> 10. We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice, peace, and people's community control of modern technology. When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are most disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But, when a long train of abuses and usurpation, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.

This point could do with some more concreteness, but raises important demands nonetheless. The extensive quotation from the Declaration of Independence highlights the confused political perspective here. In many ways, the Panthers openly called for moving beyond capitalism, but at other times lean on the language of the bourgeois revolutions. 

A program of socialist revolution should begin where these bourgeois revolutionaries ended, and continue the emancipation of humanity. There's no need to reiterate the gains that have been made so far, and this point is politically confusing. 

## Learning the Lessons
This program is indicative of the flaws in the Panthers' approach. They had no idea of orienting towards the mass organizations of the working class such as the trade unions, which could have added muscle to the organization and protected them from repression. 

The Panthers' focus on [[mutual aid]] was also a hinderance. While it was laudable, the role of a vanguard party is not to attempt to fill the cracks left by capitalism. This task is far too large for even a huge organization to tackle. Instead, we have to be extremely sharp in our priorities. The role of Marxists is to train [[cadre]] in revolutionary methods. This is the only way that we can make our voice heard for the working class when they're looking for an alternative. Even then, we have to have a strong orientation towards the organizations of the working class, since the masses trust their mass organizations more than tiny groups they've never heard of before. 

## Role of the Marxists
Unfortunately, the [[SWP (USA)]] at the time of the Panthers had lost its footing. It provided *some* Marxist ideas to the movement, but ended up trying to take a shortcut by pandering to Black Nationalism. It ended up tail-ending the whole movement. 

## Legacy
Newton wanted to amend the healthcare demand to include all Americans, which caused internal friction. Seale eventually moved towards a class struggle perspective. 

> Racism and ethnic differences allow the power structure to exploit the masses of workers in this country, because that’s the key by which they maintain their control. To divide the people and conquer them is the objective of the power structure . . . it’s really the small, minority ruling class that is dominating, exploiting, and oppressing the working and laboring people . . . So in essence it is not at all a race struggle . . . In our view it is a class struggle between the massive proletarian working class and the small, minority ruling class. Working-class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative, oppressive ruling class. So let me emphasize again—we believe our fight is a class struggle and not a race struggle.
> - Bobby Seale

It was too late. The Party had grown using the DNA of the original program, and the mentality of most members was that the Panthers were a Black-only organization. Even so, some white workers were drawn into the struggle. The state couldn't abide this threat. Repression was brutal. But we have to hold the Panthers to a high standard here. Repression alone cannot destroy a revolutionary organization that has clear ideas, whose time has come. For example, [[Bolsheviks]] faced much more severe repression, but eventually toppled the state. 

## Conclusion
Genuine Black liberation is only possible on the basis of socialist revolution. Therefore, we are obligated to critique this party platform, in order to fine tune the most direct possible way towards the releasing of humanity from the straitjacket of capitalism.
