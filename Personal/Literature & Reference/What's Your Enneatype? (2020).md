# The Enneagram: what it is and what it isn't
The authors use the example of an ideal dinner party as a way to view how differently different people choose to engage with the world and each other. They argue that these are not totally conscious choices, and our preferences are informed by both positive and negative factors, such as our childhood, socio-economic background, and our personal trauma. 

The authors believe that the [[What is the Enneagram?]] system is a good method for naming the motivations of ourselves and those around us. They say that this system explains *why* people do what they do, and it is not a personality test, but a framework that can be useful. 

## What it is
### Nine-pointed figure
The authors turn to the visual representation of the enneagram. They inform us that there are nine *enneatypes* which are arranged around a circle, with lines interconnecting some of the types. They explain that these lines represent the behaviors of each type during *integration* and *disintegration,* or good and bad states of mind.
