# I. Introduction
The development of science and technology during the Rennaisance was only possible due to the monarchies rising above the feudal aristocracy, and centralizing power to a degree. This led to the development of the first nation-states. 

Only on this basis was the world "really discovered" and science took off. The era seemed to call for intellectual giants, and it also created them. The so-called 'rennaisance men' were experts in many fields, and were very well travelled overall. 

During this period, science was inherently revolutionary, since it had to wage a bitter struggle against the church just to exist. The first scientists of each field had to build up those systems of thought based on pieced-together findings from ancient civilizations such as Greece and the Arab world. 

The first period of natural science was characterized by a focus on the immutability of nature. Species were cataloged with no regard for the movement of nature as a whole. In this way, natural science stood far above Greek society in analytical technique, but didn't rise to the kneecap of the Greeks when it came to theoretical method. 

Kant was the first to crack this ossified shell. Geology granted these ideas proof in the form of skeletons of past animals that were now extinct, proving that nature too comes into being and passes out of being in time. 

The further development of science brought us back to the way that the Greek dialecticians thought about the world, just on a much higher technical level. 

The [[evolution]] of humanity follows the same patterns as the evolution of other animals. After the differentiation of the hand from the foot, humans became able to wield tools. This laid the basis for the development of the brain and so forth. 

>The specialisation of the hand â€“ this implies the tool, and the tool implies specific human activity, the transforming reaction of man on nature, production.

The development of the hand went 'hand-in-hand' (haha) with the development of the brain. The tool was developed at first slightly, then the brain developed as a tool for determining the best way to put the hand to work. This back-and-forth proceeded to the formation of the whole modern organism. 

Now, we get to *history*. All species have history, which for them is determined by factors and events totally unknown to the animals in question. Only humanity has the potential to understand our own history, and to shape it for ourselves consciously. 

However, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Human history is still for the most part determined by forces we are not controlling. The activity and process most essential to our history, production of the necessities of life, is most of all dominated by these unforseen events and uncontrolled processes. 

>Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom. Only conscious organisation of social production, in which production and distribution are carried on in a planned way, can lift mankind above the rest of the animal world as regards the social aspect, in the same way that production in general has done this for men in their aspect as species. Historical evolution makes such an organisation daily more indispensable, but also with every day more possible. From it will date a new epoch of history, in which mankind itself, and with mankind all branches of its activity, and especially natural science, will experience an advance that will put everything preceding it in the deepest shade.

We cannot predict the future of the universe millions of years after Earth has lost the conditions for life to exist, but we can use the logical conclusions of our thought to make guesses about what will happen to the universe. 

In the same way that nature on Earth is constantly in motion, with species disappearing and emerging all the time, we can reasonably conclude that the universe is the same way in terms of whole worlds, stars, and galaxies. It wouldn't make sense if the Earth was the only time the universe generated life and consciousness, only for the planet to disappear just as soon as it arrived, and for these forces to never again exist in the universe. 

The chief question posed to science is now how heat, once dissapated into space, can somehow be transformed or stored up such that it can accomplish work again. If this isn't the case, then the universe is truly heading towards a death. 

# II. [[dialectics]]
[[Engels breaks down the laws of dialectics into three principles]]:
1. The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa
2. The law of the interpenetration of opposites
3. The law of the negation of the negation

These were developed by [[Hegel]] in an [[idealism|idealistic]] way. When we set these laws on a materialistic basis, they make a lot more sense. 

## The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa
In nature, on a case-by-case basis, the only way to advance to a qualitative change is in the realm of small mathematical additions or subtractions. 

For example, an earthquake only happens because of small, continuous additions in potential energy caused by the movement of plate tectonics. In the same way, all chemical and physical reactions change states due to such a process. At a certain point, the quantitatitve becomes a qualitative shift. 

No matter how simple this concept is, the generalization of this concept into a law applicable to physics, chemistry, natural science, and human society is an act of historic importance.
