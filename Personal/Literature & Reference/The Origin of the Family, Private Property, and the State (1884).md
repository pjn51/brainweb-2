# Introduction by Rob Sewell
Discussing the anthropologist Lewis Morgan, [[Rob Sewell]] says that it was he who first wrote about human society as a society with stages, each having [[contradiction|contradictory]] features of development and regression (p.vii). 

## Lewis Henry Morgan
Going even farther back, the author says that our descent from ape to human began some 6 million years ago, and was explained by [[Engels]] in his pamphlet, [[The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)]] (p.xi). 

In this, he says, Engels reversed [[Darwin|Darwin's]] order of events and posited that the upright walk and the development of the hand spurred brain growth, not the other way around (p.xii). 

## Egalitarian relationship
Citing another anthropologies, Patricia Draper, Sewell notes that pre-class society showed a tendency towards gender egalitarianism (p.xv). [[All oppression is founded on class society]]. 

## Female descent
Sewell explains that Morgan, having lived among the Iriquous for a time, saw that "social fatherhood" was the norm, and said that descent was tracked through the mother, or matrilinearly (p.xviii). [[Before class society, descent was matrilinear]].

The author also examines the working practice of modern tribal people, the !Kung. He quotes another work that says the !Kung tend to spend 12-19 hours a week gathering food, and retire at 60. Sewell also notes that even here we can see the beginning of a sexual division of labor, with men concentrating on hunting while women tend to gather (p.xxi).

## Childlike simplicity
Sewell defends Engels from some of his attackers, who criticize the idea that pre-class society was matriarchical. Sewell agrees that there is little evidence for matriarchical societies, but says that Engels never defended such a view (p.xxiv). In fact, I think that such an attack is baseless, because the Marxist claim is that pre-class society wasn't very hierarchical at all, not that women dominated men. [[Pre-class society was relatively egalitarian]].
