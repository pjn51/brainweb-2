# Introduction by Rob Sewell
Discussing the anthropologist Lewis Morgan, [[Rob Sewell]] says that it was he who first wrote about human society as a society with stages, each having [[contradiction|contradictory]] features of development and regression (p.vii). 

## Lewis Henry Morgan
Going even farther back, the author says that our descent from ape to human began some 6 million years ago, and was explained by [[Engels]] in his pamphlet, [[The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man (1876)]] (p.xi). 

In this, he says, Engels reversed [[Darwin|Darwin's]] order of events and posited that the upright walk and the development of the hand spurred brain growth, not the other way around (p.xii). 

## Egalitarian relationship
Citing another anthropologies, Patricia Draper, Sewell notes that pre-class society showed a tendency towards gender egalitarianism (p.xv). [[All oppression is founded on class society]]. 

## Female descent
