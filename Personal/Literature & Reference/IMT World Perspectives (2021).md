> This is the draft of the World Perspectives document that will be voted on at the upcoming World Congress of the International Marxist Tendency.

## 1. Introduction

## 1.1. The nature of perspectives
The EC says that this document will be more focused than past WP documents, since there are too many important events to cover all of them. 

## 1.2. Dramatic events
The EC outlines how global crisis in [[capitalism]] is spreading in waves across the globe, from [[June 2020 uprising]] in the [[USA]] to massive protest in [[India]] and [[Russia]]. 

## 1.3. A global crisis like no other
The EC highlights the role of [[COVID-19]] in this crisis.

## 1.4. Capitalism cannot solve the problem
The EC ties COVID-19 with the environmental destruction caused by capitalist expansion, and say that this shows the need for a [[economic planning|planned economy]]. They lambast the bosses for hypocritically calling for unity against the virus while they pocket all the profit and take no risk.

## 1.5. Workers' lives at risk
The EC calls attention to the mangled vaccine rollout, saying that workers are being forced back into unsafe situations for the profits of the bosses.

## 1.6. Economic crisis
The EC lists the death tolls from countries around the world, and includes statistics on the rising poverty rates around the world due to this crisis. They cite the UN as saying that 270 million will not have enough to eat in 2021, an 82% increase from 2020. 

## 1.7. A crisis of the regime
The EC expands on the previous point, saying that there are now multiple regimes that are facing crisis directly as the masses begin to understand the role of the ruling class in the mis-management of COVID-19 and economy. 

## 2. [[USA]]
The EC says that the economy of the richest country on Earth is on life support, with [[state]] forced to take a very active role in the economy. They go on to claim that the possibility of revolution here, once a distant thought, is now more and more looming.

## 2.1. Inequality and poralization
The EC cites wealth inequality statistics, saying that the masses are more and more willing to take action against the bankers and capitalists directly, which is causing concern among the architects of [[capital]]. 

## 2.2. The assault on the Capitol
The EC argues that the breaching of the Capitol indicates that the US state now faces a crisis of the regime, despite the fact that the assault was neither a coup nor an insurrection. They attribute the anger of the crowd to the conduct of the rich and powerful of society, which they say has been skillfully manipulated by [[Trump]], despite his own class position in the [[bourgeoisie]]. Despite this deception, the EC explain that he is destroying the legitimacy of the already-rotting institutions of the bourgeois state.

## 2.3. The impeachment
The EC explains the conduct of the GOP as a party that knows it has lost control of the Trumpist base, but is too afraid to act against Trump directly by impeaching him. 

The EC simultaneously highlights the hilariously ineffective nature of the "insurrection" while saying that this does set a dangerous precedent. The EC quotes hedge a hedge fund manager as saying the US is on the brink of facing a civil war or revolution.

The EC contrasts the strength of the Trumpist movement with [[June 2020 uprising]], which they say had 20,000 times more supporters. They include the statistic stating 54% support for the burning of the Minneapolis police precinct.

## 2.4. Change in [[class consciousness]]
The EC lambasts the forces of [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]], saying that they don't understand anything about the current situation. Bringing in the concept of [[fascism]], the EC says the mentioned groups have no idea what they're talking about, and use this boogeyman to generate support for [[Biden]] and [[Democratic Party]]. 

Discussing the class character of Trump's base, the EC says there are many disparate layers here. They call attention to the bourgeois wing, and the legions of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], as well as openly fascistic elements. But they also remind us that Trump got 74 million votes, and that means there is a layer of the [[proletariat]] that supported him over the Democrats. 

The EC claims that working class support for right wing populism will evaporate when it comes into contact with a [[workers' party]], but since none exist in the US, the right current has more life to live.

The EC explains that when a workers' party emerges, it will have a very confused character at first, and will contain all sorts of tendencies. But the EC claims that an anti-capitalist element will sooner or later predominate.

The EC calls attention to an editorial in the *Financial Times,* which paints a bleak picture for the defenders of class society. 

## 2.5. Collapse of the center
The EC highlights the fact that bourgeois democracy can only exist when the gulf between the classes is somewhat obscured, and that this situation is rapidly changing as the masses become politically active.

## 2.6. The perspectives for the Biden administration
The EC says that the Biden administration is forced to either choose political instability now, or economic instability later, and that they are choosing the latter. They say that this will prepare an even larger explosion later. 

## 3. Latin America
The EC start off by outlining the deep economic crisis the region faces today. They say that the region's [[GDP]] fell by 7.7% in 2020, on the heels of a decade long stagnation.

The EC calls attention to the uprisings in the region in [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]], which they say were temporarily cut across by COVID-19 but surged back into frame in the second half of 2020, including in [[Colombia]] where over 40 police stations have been torched.

The EC says that [[Brazil]] is one of the most unstable countries, due to a horrible pandemic response. They critique the Brazilian left for crying "fascism" when Bolsonaro was elected, but say that now his support has evaporated and the slogan "Bolsonaro out!" first put forward by the IMT has gained an echo in the [[unions]] and the parties of [[reformism]]. The EC claims that the real weakness on the Brazilian left is the subjective factor.

The EC explain how the masses in [[Peru]] brought down two governments, and that the masses in [[Guatemala]] set fire to the parliament.

Meanwhile, the EC point to [[Cuba]], where they see a severe economic crisis unfolding. They say that the island's economy has slumped by 11%, causing the state to embrace market reforms that had been on the agenda for a while. 

## 4. Europe
The EC says that real GDP fell by 7% across the [[EU]] in 2020, with unemployment rising and economic instability increasing. They criticize the vaccine rollout, saying that it resulted in many excess deaths and showed the rottenness of bourgeois solidarity.

The EC says that following Trump, the European bourgeoisie no longer feel like they can rely on traditional allies, depite the fact that Biden is seeking to strengthen ties with Europe. They say that this skepticism is impacting the ability of the US to create a unified front towards [[China]]. 

Turning to [[Germany]], the EC says that this long standing island of stability is faced with new problems. They say that Germany has cut back on economic support to the more troubled EU states such as [[Italy]] and [[Greece]].

They touch on [[France]], saying that Macron's government only has a 40% approval rating.

## 4.1. Britain
The EC says that the [[UK]] has gone from one of the most stable countries in Europe to one of the least. They cite statistics saying that the economy has fallen by nearly 10% in 2020 due to the economic crisis as well as Brexit. 

The EC calls attention to the declining infuence of the Tories, who they say have only been kept in power by the contemptible leadership of the [[Labour Party (UK)]]. They say the latter has conducted a purge of left wing elements after Corbyn was unwilling to do the same to his enemies within the party during his tenure. 

## 4.2. [[Italy]]
The EC claims that Italy is the weakest link in European capitalism right now. They expain that the center-left coalition has splintered, and that the President invited a technocrat to become Prime Minister. They say that this has invited far-right groups to expand their influence, such as the Brothers of Italy party.

The EC claim that there is no workers' party in Italy right now, but its formation is inevitable.

## 5. [[Russia]]
The EC explain that Russia is not immune to the sorts of turbulence seen elsewhere. They point to the arrest of Navalny and the demonstrations across Russia as evidence. They cite the fact that over 50,000 took to the streets, but note that this is less than the millions that rose against Lukashenko in [[Belarus]]. 

The EC argue that Navalny is currently popular, but will be seen as a footnote in history, and is just am ambitious opportunist. However, the EC also says that accidental figures also play a role in history, and a catalyst is needed to begin a reaction. 

## 5.1. Falling living standards
The EC reminds us that the real cause for the Russian unrest is mass anger at the material conditions that are developing in Russia. They describe the Putin regime as one of [[Bonapartism]], where Putin balances on the security apparatus, as well as businesses that depend on Kremlin contracts. 

The EC argues that the repressive measures that Putin has taken recently are a sign of weakness. They say that the only thing maintaining the regime is the inertia of the masses, but that this cannot continue forever. 

## 5.2. The “Communist” Party
The EC claims that the role of the subjective factor is obvious in Russia. They argue that if the CPRF (Communist Party of the Russian Federation) were a real revolutionary party, they would be preparing for power. However, according to the EC, the "Zyuganov clique" has no interest in disturbing Putin, with whom they have a comfortable arrangement. 

Despite this, the EC highlights that there have been multiple local and regional revolts of the CP membership. They say that the leadership has decried these revolters as supporters of [[Trotskyism]], but say that this has been a meaningless insult. 

The EC note that this is symptomatic of Zyuganov's fear of a Trotskyist tendency developing within the CP, but that isn't a factor right now. 

The EC outline how Russia is approaching a pre-revolutionary situation. 

## 6. India
The EC describes what they say is an insurrectionary movement of the farmers in [[India]]. They place these events in the context of a global crisis in capitalism. They say that agro-giants are trying to push down the prices that small farmers are able to get on the market, leading to widespread discontent. 

Under the current and previous governments in India, the EC explain, finance capital has been surging into the Indian agricultural sector, accompanied by new laws to expidite this force's seizure of the market. 

The EC explains that the protests began in August 2020 at the unveiling of the Farm Bills, and developed into a general strike of farmers' unions across the country. By December 2020, the EC says, five million had taken part in protests. 

The EC highlights how on January 26, 2021, the farmers forced their way into the historic Red Fort at the center of Delhi, fighting armed police. They say that the scale of these protests represents the discontent throughout society, where new layers are entering the class struggle all the time.

Far from a wave of [[fascism]] under Modi, as the EC says others suggested, we now see a shift in [[class consciousness]] among many.

## Role of the Stalinists
The EC says that Modi has been shaken by the movement, whose real weakness lies in the leadership of the trade unions, who have failed to really move the working class into struggle alongside the farmers. 

The EC call attention to the power of the Indian [[proletariat]], saying that there have been general strikes of over 200 million workers in recent memory. 

Instead of moving into battle, the EC accuses the Stalinist leaders of the [[unions]] of merely using the mass movement as a cynical attempt to gain concessions from the state. 

> In practice, they used the tactic of one-day
general strikes to allow the workers to blow off
steam, while diverting the mass movement into
harmless channels. That was the same tactic the
trade union leaders used in Greece, calling a
series of one-day general strikes. This is a trick
to wear out the workers, turning the general
strike into a meaningless gesture, creating the
illusion of decisive action, while undermining
such action in practice.

## The slogan of the general strike
The EC believes that in India, the objective conditions exist for an all-out general strike to topple the state. They accuse the leaders of the unions and the Communist parties of dragging their feet rather than taking the opportunity. 

Highlighting the urgent need to build the forces of [[Marxism]] in India, the EC says the current role of the IMT is to work patiently to win over the most revolutionary elements while maintaining perspective on their size and abilities. 

Referring to the slogan of a four-day general strike which the EC says has been circulating, they say the IMT would support this, and call for the formation of mass protest meetings to organize the workers and farmers. 

## Myanmar
In [[Myanmar]], the EC says, we can see confirmation that we live in an era of sudden change. Describing the events of the military coup, the EC blames the crisis on a battle over who should benefit from the privatization scheme that began in 1988.

Explaining the events, the EC says the struggle is really between military leaders and the international bourgeoisie, particularly those of the [[USA]]. The also note that the main issue for the American capitalists is that [[China]] is the primary trading partner of Myanmar.

The EC quotes [[Marx]] on "the whip of the counter-revolution," alleging that the repressive measures the military has employed have pushed the mass movement against them forward. 

## China
The EC explains that China was the only country to experience economic growth in 2020, and handled COVID-19 and economic crisis well, but at a cost. They say that the debt to GDP ratio has risen by 30% during COVID-19, and has now reached 285%. 

The EC cites the World Bank's prediction of 8% growth in China, and says that this will generate contradictions as China's economy is export based, but there will not be 8% growth in global demand to match the production. 

The EC argues that this will bring China and the US into conflict even more, and say that the stance [[Trump]] took towards China will continue under [[Biden]]. 

Turning to the situation within China, the EC note that social stability is decreasing, as factory closures and unemployment rise. They argue that the repressive measures taken against Hong Kong were a sign of Xi Jinping's weakness and fear of a mass movement developing. 

In the case of Hong Kong, the EC says China was able to keep a lid on events mostly, but they argue that if a movement spread to mainland China, the [[CPC]] doesn't have the power to bottle things up for long. The EC says that due to the totalitarian nature of China, great events can happen when we least expect them to.

## Changed balance of forces
The EC argues that it was [[WW2]] which got the [[USA]] out of the Depression, and such an avenue is not available today. They highlight how the need for cheap raw materials has forced China to become more and more agressive internationally, and point to Chinese investment in Africa and Southeast Asia. 

The EC note that in previous times, the tension between the USA and China would have led to war, but the balance of forces has totally changed. They observe that the USA is unable to use the military to put an end to [[North Korea]], a thorn in their side which the EC says is much less intimidating than China. 

The EC points to American inability to decisively win in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], or to defend eastern [[Ukraine]] from Russia. Despite this, the EC makes it clear that this next period won't be peaceful, it will just involve a series of small wars with proxies. They say that the US [[state]] is totally incapable of putting American soldiers on the battlefield in a big way. 

Notably, they say this could change if a situation of [[Bonapartism]] emerges in the USA, but the EC belives that this would only be possible after "a series of decisive defeats of the American working class."

Instead of outright warfare, the EC states, the US now maintains its rule through trade agreements and sanctions. 

> Clausewitz said that war is politics by other means. Nowadays we should add that trade is war by other means.

## "Voodoo economics"
The EC argues that the bourgeoisie, desperate for a way out of crisis, has re-discovered [[Keynesianism]], even though these ideas have already failed the test of history. They say that the idea of escaping crisis by injecting a boatload of money sounds promising, especially to left [[reformism|reformists]] that can escape the responsiblilty of fighting capitalism. 

The EC reminds us that the state is not a bottomless well of money, and cannot simply print its way out of every crisis. However, the EC observes that this strategy is being adopted by one state after another. They say that this is creating a mountain of debt that will be absolutely devastating when it crashes down. 

## Role of the state in the economy
The EC quotes the *Financial Times,* who are calling attention to the extensive government intervention in the economy in 2020. The EC points to the fact that the FT approves of this, and now states that free-market capitalism is not "self-sufficient, and needs to be protected and maintained to be resilient." 

The EC believes that this is an admission that the "free" market is now forced more and more to rely on the state as a crutch. The EC explains that global debt has reached 356% of global GDP, up by 35% from 2019. 

The EC state that the bourgeoisie are gambling with money that they don't have. Sooner or later, the EC predicts, this will catch up with them and the debts will have to be paid. 

## Is recovery possible?
The EC attribute recent articles predicting a quick recovery to the euphoria of a bourgeoisie that is blind to reality. The EC argues that the current crisis is qualitatively different from the ones in the past because of the coronavirus.

However, the EC does *not* rule out a recovery. They say that some sort of recovery is inevitable due to the cyclical nature of capitalism. Instead, the EC thinks we should be asking what *kind* of recovery it will be. The EC believes that the recovery will be a temporary interlude between one crisis and another. They say that the recovery may be spurred on by pent-up demand from the depressed consumer spending during COVID-19, making it seem that the economy has bounced back.

## Recovery and the class struggle
The EC hypothesize about this possibility, and analyze the consequences. They say that this would be a boon to the class struggle, since a rise in unemployment causes hesitation on the part of the workers when acting in their interests. 

Furthermore, the EC argue that such a recovery would be very unstable, and the higher it climbed, the longer it would fall. Also, the EC say that such a recovery would most likely benefit China more than the US and Europe, exacerbating tensions. This, according to them, would accelerate the trade war. 

The EC reminds us that it was not the [[stock market]] crash that caused the Great Depression, but the protectionist economic policies that followed it. 

## The "Roaring Twenties"
The EC claim that bourgeois economists seek to paint a parallel between our time and the "Roaring Twenties." The EC says that this is hardly a positive thing. They remind us that the recovery after 1924 had a feverish character, with massive speculation, and that it ended in the crash of 1929. They say that is is possible for us to have the same situation occur. 

However, the EC point to one major difference - the amount of ficticious capital is vastly greater today. They say that because of this, the crash will be greater than the 1929 crash. 

The EC argues that because we are no longer on the gold standard, governments are now free to create ficticious capital at will, severing the relationship between money and real value represented by the commodities that money can purchase. They point to the fact that the M2 supply has increased by $4 trillion in 2020, a 26% increase this year. 

The EC argues that this signals inflation in the future, but say that this hasn't materialized due to severly lowered demand due to COVID-19. This, according to them, has pushed the inflationary forces into speculation in cryptocurrency and other things. 

The EC claims that while we cannot predict when things will shift, we can be sure that this debt will bring about a panic at some point. They say that interest rates will skyrocket, cheap credit will dry up, and banks will cease lending to small and medium businesses. 

This, according to the EC, will cause a panic in the stock market. Finally, the EC warns us of a sell-off in the [[currency]] itself as investors seek to find a safe haven for their wealth that isn't subject to inflationary pressure. 

As the capitalists turn to investing in gold and platinum, the EC forewarns, the real economy will grind to a halt and unemployment will jump. The EC even claims that we may see bank failures, which will further destabilize the economy. 

The EC believes that the warning signs of such a crash are already upon us, and that the state and the bourgeoisie have failed to learn the lessons of the past, and in fact, have no way to avoid the path they're on.

## Social and political consequences
> For Marxists, the study of economics only has importance insofar as it expresses itself in the consciousness of the masses.

The EC dives into some of the differences between the crash of the 1930s and today. They say that the situation was resolved relatively rapidly, with the only options being the victory of the [[proletariat]], or a reaction towards [[fascism]] or Bonapartism. They say that such a rapid solution is ruled out for us. 

First of all, the EC argues that the working class is too massive for a fascist or Bonapartist reaction, which requries a [[petty bourgeoisie]] or [[peasantry]] to lean on. Also, the EC says that the working class has an even more degenerate leadership than it had in the 30s. 

When these factors combine, the EC says they point towards a lengthy crisis that is turbulent, with ups and downs that may last years. The EC reminds us of the "molecular process of revolution" which was coined by [[Trotsky]]. They say that while COVID-19 and mass unemployment have acted as a brake on the class struggle, we should look under the surface and see the forces that act upon [[class consciousness]]. 

The EC argues that the youth are wide open to revolutionary ideas, and the contradictions of society continue to accumulate despite the lack of an open class struggle. 

## The trade unions
The EC cites the example of France in 1968 as an example of [[sectarianism|sectarians]] and the bourgeoisie caught totally off guard by a mass movement that seemed to come out of nowhere. They say that like today, these people failed to look below the surface and prepare for future conditions. 

The EC underlines how even a meager economic recovery will be an opening in the class struggle, with workers seeking to gain back what they have lost. The EC says that this explosion will shake the trade unions to their foundations. 

Discussing the trade union leadership, the EC explains that these leaders reflect the consciousness of the past, rather than the present. To the EC, this means that workers will have to shake these leaders off when returning to a militant stance.

The EC outlines how when fighting for concessions, the workers will have every victory eroded by inflation which will push them further and further in order to maintain their standards of living. 

## The task before us
> The year 2021 will be like no other, the working class has entered a very harsh school, there will be many defeats and setbacks, but from that school the workers will draw the necessary lessons.

The EC urges us to be prepared for these events that are to come. They say that the main issue is a lack of leadership within the working class. The EC quotes Lenin, who said "Life teaches." By this, the EC argues he meant that the workers needed to go through a series of struggles in order to develop revolutionary conclusions. 

The EC argues that this process would be dramatically sped up if there was a mass revolutionary organization that was armed with enough members and authority to direct a decent segment of the struggle. They say that the [[IMT]] has the potential to become such a party, but is only an embryo at this point. 

The EC frankly admits that at this time, the IMT lacks the numbers and resources to play a central role. However, they say that with correct slogans and ideas, they can reach the most advanced workers and youth, through which they can reach wider layers.  

The EC aims for small victories and modest gains. Looking to the IMT's competition, the EC says that there are far fewer sects than in the past, and the forces of [[Stalinism]] are far weaker than they used to be. They say that the main competition will be the forces of left [[reformism]], who have no clear political perspective. 

The EC predicts that these left reformists will come to the helm of the mass movement eventually, and will sometimes appear revolutionary, but will alway vaccilate under the pressure of the bourgeoisie. 

The EC criticizes the rivals of the IMT for failing to win over the youth, and say that this is a critical metric of how connected an organization is to the coming consciousness of the masses. They explain that the IMT's strength is based on Marxist theory and an orientation to the youth. 

They say there is no room for complacency in the struggles to come, and that we must always start with quality wherever we work. They advise us to win the ones and twos and educate ourselves in order to form healthy [[cadre]]. 

The EC argues that cadre formation goes hand in hand with growth, and they say the IMT is doing well in this regard, and has won over one thousand new members during COVID-19, while most sects have begun to collapse. 

> Comrades of the international! We are in a race against the clock. Our task can be simply stated: it is to make conscious the unconscious (or semi-conscious) will of the working class to change society. Great events are being prepared. In order to raise up to the immense tasks, we require an internal revolution, beginning with a revolution of our own mentality. We cannot think in the same way as in the past. All traces of the small circle mentality and routine must be rooted out. What is needed is a professional approach to party building. There is nothing more important in our lives. And if we continue to pursue the correct ideas, tactics and methods, we will certainly achieve it.
