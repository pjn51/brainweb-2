This article by [[Alan Woods]] is a good intro to the ideas of [[Marxism]]. 

In 1992, Fukuyama published his work, The End of History and the Last Man, in which he proclaimed the death of [[socialism]] and the victory of bourgeois systems of thought and governance for all eternity. This thesis was supported by the demise of the Soviet Union (see [[Russia]]) and the apparent boom of the market economy in the 90s. 

However, the crisis of 2008 brought this argument to its knees. The bourgeois economists, with their ‘efficient market hypothesis,’ predicted an end to the cyclical nature of capitalism, and an end to the slumps. This was blown out of the water. This hypothesis is in fact nothing new. It’s just a repackaging of old bourgeois thought, which said that supply and demand would reach an equilibrium. This nonsense was dispelled by [[Marx]] himself, who pointed out how [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. 

It is becoming more and more clear that [[capitalism]] has exhausted its ability to expand the [[means of production]] and move humanity forward. The economy hasn't recovered since 2008, and has moved more and more towards a permanent state of crisis. Industrial production has been sluggish, and millions are unemployed. 

All these factors show that the productive forces are being held back by the twin institutions of private property and the nation-state. This is happening in the [[USA]], in [[China]], in Europe, and in the rest of the world as well. Capitalism has reached a historical dead-end. 

## The crisis of bourgeois ideology
Marxism is at its base a philosophy and a system of analysis. It is able to provide new ideas and new insights, unlike capitalism which hasn't been able to provide new ideas since it entered its era of historical decline. When capitalism was still a progressive force, its ideology was also progressive. The Enlightenment was the culmination of the progressive bourgeoisie rewriting human thought. 

Instead of new ideas, the modern bourgeoisie writes off the idea of new thought altogether through [[postmodernism]]. Postmodernists talk of the “end of ideology” because capitalism is no longer capable of producing a valid excuse for itself in the form of an ideology. 

In opposition to this, [[dialectical materialism]] stands as a vibrant, dynamic way of examining the world. The progress of modern science has provided more and more support for the ideas of dialectics, and the idea that small changes can accumulate and culminate in a giant sudden shift. [[dialectics]] highlights the connections between things and the shifting evolving nature of the world. 

## [[historical materialism]] 
We can apply dialectical materialism to history and human development. Each society, and especially the most prominent thinkers of that society, believe that their way of ordering humanity is the best, and indeed the only, way to do so. [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]]. 

Just as species evolve, we understand that society evolves. Small scale processes build up over time, and eventually lead to revolutions. The root cause of this is the inability of the current system to build the productive forces and move humanity forward. [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]]. However, the relationship between the many elements and components of society is a dialectical one, and quite complex. Marxists don't reduce everything to economics, we just understand that out of all the myriad causes, economics is the largest single cause of societal change. 

## The Communist Manifesto 
[[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]] is as current today as the day it was written. Some names would need to be changed, but in essence the ideas still apply. Marx and [[Engels]] were able to predict the world of late-capitalism centuries before it began to take shape, including the rise of multinational corporations, the domination of the financial sector, and [[imperialism]]. 

Anyone can see that Marx was totally correct about the concentration of [[capital]]. Today, the top 10 biggest corporations have more wealth than the combined fortune of the bottom 180 countries. Similarly, anyone can see that Marx and later [[Lenin]] were totally correct about the concentration of economic power in the hands of the banks. 

The growth of companies under capitalism has transformed from a genuine development of the technology and capability of humanity into a process of cannibalism. In pursuit of profits, factories are stripped, assets are speculated on, and thousands are laid off. 

## Globalisation
Marx even predicted the process of globalisation, which had barely begun to take shape. The marvelous new technology and techniques that allow people across the whole world to cooperate has been strait-jacketed into the narrow perspective of the profit motive and private property. Without capitalism, this system of cooperation could bridge the gaps between nations, preventing wars and uniting humanity. Instead, it becomes the source of conflict, as countries invade one another to secure stable resource extraction and production. 

As a result of these failures, 1.2 billion live on less than $2 per day. Eight million of these people die every year due to their poverty. At the same time, the world’s eight richest control more wealth than the combination of 3.6 billion of the world’s poorest. 

## For a rational plan of production
The need of humanity can only be met through a rational planning of all the resources of the Earth. Our current system serves only to destroy the planet for the benefit of a handful of people. 

Humanity has the ability to solve every problem facing us today. The only reason these problems still persist is because of the limitations of capitalism. 

Just as the [[bourgeoisie]] swept away all the limitations of [[feudalism]] on production and ushered us into a new era, so too must the [[proletariat]] sweep away the limitations of capitalism. The only way this can be done (and has ever been done) is through revolution. 

## Class struggle
Human [[class consciousness]] usually lags behind the conditions of the real world, and is profoundly conservative. On a philosophical level, a revolution is the rapid acceleration of human consciousness into line with objective reality. 

As long as the productive forces are developing, most people will accept that the current system is working, and a revolution won't come about. They see the system as inevitable, as unavoidable. It takes huge events to shake people out of this perception. [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]]. These huge events are coming soon, because of all the decay of capitalism we see around us. 

A period of bleak reaction can quickly develop into a mood of international revolution. During periods of intense change, the masses will learn very fast. A growing number of people are questioning capitalism, and whole new layers are becoming open to the ideas of Marxism.
