# General introduction and the history of materialism
Engels explains that this book first took shape around the time where a German academic, Duhring, declared that he stood for socialism, but poured scorn on Marx. At the same time, the socialists in Germany were merging into a united party, Engels says. 

Engels explains that Duhring sought to split the German socialists, and in order to maintain unity, Engels entered the theoretical struggle. 

The author pokes fun at what he calls the German national trend of always making their ideas into an "all-comprising system" of thought. Because of this tendency, Engels continues, Duhring felt compelled to write a ton about all sorts of various topics. This meant, the author explains, that in order to counter this, he was forced to develop an all-encompasing mode of analysis as well. 

Out of this massive work, Engels says, he developed three chapters as a smaller pamphlet. He goes on to define a few terms that he will use, and remarks that many English readers might find his staunch materialism off-putting, despite the origination of philisophical materialism in Britain.

# The Development of Utopian Socialism
Engels asserts that while the rise of [[socialism]] is due to the economic facts of life (the antagonism between worker and owner, and the anarchy of production), the theoretical development of socialist thought can be traced from the French philosophers of the 1700s. He says that like any theory, socialist theory had to "connect itself with the intellectual stock-in-trade ready to its hand."

Engels outlines the revolutionary ideas of the Enlightenment. He says that they cast aside all superstition and demanded that each idea and institution be judged based on Reason, seeking eternal truth and justice. Of course, he adds, this was total bullshit and represented the "idealized kingdom of the [[bourgeoisie]]."

Engels continues on to say that these ideas, once implemented, were reduced from eternal justice to bourgeois justice before the law. 

> ...the *Contrat Social* of Rousseau, came into being, and only could come into being, as a democratic bourgeois republic. The great thinkers of the 18th century could, no more than their predecessors, go beyond the limits imposed upon them by their epoch.

Engels argues that in the bourgeois revolutions, the bourgeoisie were able to present themselves as the leaders of the oppressed against the aristocracy, since there were two antagonisms side-by-side: that of the aristocracy against the capitalists, and the workers against the "rich idlers."

However, Engels underlines, there were nevertheless "outbursts" of the proto-[[proletariat]]. Alongside these, he says, were theoretical attempts to articulate the demands of a class which was only beginning to form. He mentions [[Saint-Simon]], Fourier, and Owen as the thinkers of this milieu. 

Engels says that all three were united in one thing: they saw their mission as the liberation of all humanity at once, rather than the victory of one class over another. Because of this, Engels says they have a lot in common with the Enlightenment thinkers who envisioned a heaven on earth, nonewithstanding that their two heavens are quite different. 

From these utopian thinkers points of view, Engels imagines, the world is an irrational place, and is only irrational insofar as we have misunderstood rationality. Engels remarks that the discovery of Truth is just a happy accident to these thinkers, and may just as easily have happened 500 years earlier or later than it did. 

Engels covers the degradation of the Enlightenment ideas - from the social contract to the Reign of Terror, and the flight of the bourgeoisie into the arms of Napoleon's rule. He says that the antagonism between rich and poor intensified after the removal of the guild system, the opposite of what the theorists said would happen. 

Engels covers a lot of the changes of society as capitalism emerged, from the rise in prostitution to the use of gold as tool of control instead of the sword. He says that cash payment became more and more the sole nexus between man and man. 

In this context, Engels explains, the utopian thinkers didn't have to work so hard to see the flaws of the previous ideas. However, Engels continues, the development of modern industry was just beginning to play its course, and these thinkers didn't understand the direction that events were going in - the creation of the proletariat, the concentration of wealth, etc. 

Not understanding the forces that could actually change society, Engels remarks, the utopian thinkers turned to the molding of human minds through imposition, propaganda, and experimentation. He says that the more completely each system worked out the details, the faster it drifted off into the realm of fantasy. 

While Engels criticizes these thinkers for the above reasons, he says that we should still examine them since they have glimmers of good ideas that shine through the bullshit. 

First turning to Saint-Simon, Engels says that this man was a child of the French Revolution which appeared at the time to be a victory of the laboring third estate over the idle classes, but was really the victory of a specific sector of this third estate - the bourgeoisie. 

Engels thinks that this informed Saint-Simon's ideas that the main conflict of society was between workers and idlers - where workers included the active bourgeoisie, and idlers included all who didn't engage in production. 

Engels says that Saint-Simon had no faith in the idlers, nor the propertyless masses to lead society, and thought that science and industry must be united under a new [[religion]] to lead society. 

Engels credits Saint-Simon with seeing that economic conditions lay the basis for political institutions, and saying that the French revolution was a class war between aristocrat, bourgeois, and worker. 

Engels now turns to [[Fourier]], who he says developed the embryo of a criticism of the existing conditions of sociery. According to Engels, Fourier ruthlessly took the bourgeois thinkers to task regarding the difference between their shiny ideas and the grim reality of capitalism. 

Engels credits Fourier for being "the first to declare that in any given society the degree of woman's emancipation is the natural measure of the general emancipation."

The author says that Fourier is at his best when discussing the history of society, using the [[dialectics|dialectical]] method to confirm that society moves in circular contradictions which it is unable to escape from. 

Turning to England, Engels says that a quiet revolution in production was occuring as capitalism laid a new foundation for society. In this context, he says, Robert [[Owen]] stepped forward - adopting the teachings of materialism to claim that our character is due to genetics and the environment. 

Through careful planning and education, Engels informs us, Owen was able to elevate the cultural level and living standards of workers at factories he oversaw. Later, Engels says, Owen noted that factories of that day were producing far more than the population had needed just a generation ago, and Owen correctly attributed the difference to profit, saying that if this profit went back to society, living standards would be much higher. 

Engels describes how Owen's social position changed after he began to attack what he saw as the obstacles to a communist society - private property, religion, and marriage. After being expelled from the elite circles in which he had once walked, Engels outlines, Owen turned directly to the workers to continue his advocacy - and was involved in the passing of some reforms in England. 

Engels concludes this chapter with an overview of the utopian mode of thinking, which he says is characterized by viewing socialism as the expression of absolute truth, which only has to be discovered to be achieved. Since these thinkers couldn't agree on what the absolute truth actually was, Engels continues, the only thing that really developed was a mish mash of "average socialism" with many shades of opinion, where people argue pointlessly over what the future will look like. 

> To make a science of Socialism, it had first to be placed upon a real basis. 

# Dialectics
Engels begins by introducing us to [[Hegel]]. He says that Hegel's greatest merit was the reintroduction of [[dialectics]]. He says that while the ancient Greek philosophers were great dialecticians, the minds of western philosophy had become stuck in a metaphysical mode of thinking.

Engels notes that when we consider the world, or the history of humanity, or our own thoughts, at first we see a tangled mess of connections and relationships. He says that within this tangle, nothing remains what, where, and as it was, and everything is is arising and disappearing all the time.

Engels asserts that this view of the world, where we look at the picture as a whole rather than each isolated element, is primitive and naive, but intrinsically correct. He explains that it was first clearly formulated by [[Heraclitus]], who said that "everything is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away." 

Forging ahead, Engels advises that while this conception expresses the general character of the world, it doesn't explain the details or the individual elements of the picture. He says that in order to do this, we must isolate each element from its causes and effects, studying it in isolation. 

Engels credits [[environmental science|natural science]] for pursuing this task. He says that they ammassed [[data]] for the categorization and classification of elements in the world, which helped to advance human understanding of the world. However, Engels argues that the stick has bent too far, and that the predominance of a static, [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view has now become a hinderance as we are buried under a mass of data.

To the metaphysician, Engels claims, things are isolated and must be considered one after another as fixed objects of investigation. He says that the metaphysician looks at elements of the world as static and unchanging though time. To this person, Engels notes, cause and effect stand in rigid opposition to one another.

At first sight, Engels elaborates, this way of thinking seems useful, since it's just common sense. However, he points out that this way of thinking reaches a limit, beyond which it becomes one-sided and forgets the connections between things, forgets their movement and motion.

Turning to a specific example, Engels asks us to determine if an animal is alive or dead. He says that a metaphysical approach struggles in vain to determine the exact point at which the killing of a fetus is murder, and cannot solve this issue because of their static view of reality.

> [!note]
> It's striking how relevant this passage is, 141 years later.

Engels generalizes this example, saying that every organized being is simultaneously itself and becoming something altogether different. He notes that we are absorbing new material and releasing other material out of our body all the time.

Additionally, Engels finds that "the two poles of an antithesis, positive and negative," mutually interpenetrate with one another. Likewise, Engels points out that cause and effect are conceptions that we have to apply on a case-by-case basis. An effect of one phenomenon will become a cause of another. 

Turning back to [[environmental science]], Engels says that the theory of [[evolution]] dealt a savage blow to the metaphysical conception of nature by revealing that all organic beings are the products of a process of change that has gone on for billions of years.

Engels argues that a perfect representation of the universe can only be obtained through the methods of dialectics due to the innumerable actions, reactions, and interactions between the infinite elements of the universe. He says that this is the spirit in which the German philosophy has worked. He credits [[Kant]] for "resolving the stable Solar system of Newton."

Engels asserts that this German philosophy culminated in the Hegelian system, which included the whole world within its vision of change and flow. Engels assures us that when applied to history, we can see that a process of the evolution of humanity emerges. 

However, Engels claims that Hegel was only able to ask the question, and was prevented from answering it by his tendency towards [[idealism]]. To Hegel, Engels tells us, things and their evolution were only realized pictures of "the Idea" which existed somewhere in eternity. Engels says that this way of thinking turned the whole Hegelian system upside down and suffered from an uncurable contradiction - that it was a system incorporating evolution and change, but claimed to itself be a static, permanent framework for all eternity.

Engels says that this contradiction naturally led thinkers back to [[materialism]], but materialism on a new level of development. To Engels, this new materialism embraced dialectics and no longer required the sort of philosophy which "queen-like, pretended to rule the remaining mob of sciences." 

Turning from natural science to history, Engels says that certian historical facts are pointing towards this change in philosophy, namely the working-class uprisings in the 1800s. Engels says that the class struggle between [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]] came into full view and revealed the inaccuracy of bourgeois economics. However, metaphysics had no explanation for these events, and viewed the relations of production as a footnote in the history of civilization.

Engels asserts that these new facts made it imperative to investigate all past history, where he says we find that the content through-and-through is all about the class struggle (apart from pre-civilization). Engels elaborates that this class struggle is based upon the economic foundations of society, the modes of production and exchange. 

Engels credits Hegel with freeing history from metaphysics, and now calls on us to free history from Hegel's idealism. 

Engels asserts that because of this philisophical basis, [[socialism]] is no longer just a good idea that somebody came up with, but the expression of the struggle between the workers and the capitalists. He says that our purpose is no longer to create a perfect schematic of a new society, but to look around at the possibilities available to us through the method of dialectical materialism, and search for a way of ending this class struggle once and for all. 

Engels argues that the pre-Marxist utopian socialism was only able to criticize capitalist relations, but was unable to understand them and propose a way forward, because it couldn't grasp why the horrors of capitalism were necessary for capitalist development.

Engels asserts that Marxist economics, including the discovery of surplus-value, was able to uncover that the appropriation of unpaid [[labor]] is the basis of capitalism. Through this, Engels proclaims that with [[Marx]], socialism became a science.

> Damn I forgot how excellent this chapter is at introducing dialectics, explaining the need for a dialectical materialist approach, and laying the foundation for why Marxism is called scientific socialism.

# Historical Materialism
The production and exchange of things is the basis of all social structure. If that is true, then social structure must be dependent on the way things are produced and exchanged. If that is true, then social change can only come about if this economic basis is changed. 

Growing discontent is evidence that the social order is no longer functioning properly. If materialism is true, we must also use the foundational economics to somehow resolve this discontent. We can’t just reason our way out of these issues. 

The capitalist mode of production came about because the bourgeoisie were able to shake off the feudal structure of society. That structure was no longer propelling humanity forward, instead it was holding it back. Capitalism developed the [[means of production]] for a time, but eventually it also began to hold back the productive forces. 

## Pre-capitalist economics

It was based on private ownership of the means of production by individual laborers. Agriculture was based on many small peasant holdings, and manufacture was based on the guild system or freeman workshops. 

Capitalist production centralized all the individual tools of the workshops into great factories of production. This was its progressive role. 

These new factories could not be worked by individuals, they required many workers. And so the proletariat was born. Production went from an individual action to a social one. 

This social production was more efficient than individual production, and won the battle of price. This is the force that eradicated handicraft and made capitalism the dominant mode. 
	
## The question of ownership

The craftsman owned the product of his labor. He owned the tools, and did all the work himself in his own workshop. There was no need to appropriate the final product from someone else. 
	
The worker in the factory does not own the product. The owner of the means of production owns the product, even though not an ounce of his own labor went into it. 
Basically, production had become social while appropriation remained individual. This contradiction contains the source of all the social antagonisms that exist today. 

Eventually, the separation of the producers from the means of production became universal and permanent with the demise of the feudal system.

Capitalist production is commodity production. [[commodities]] are not produced because of a visible need, but as speculation. This means that anarchy reigns in the production of goods. In medieval society, we had production for need, now we have production for profit. 

In order to deal with this anarchy, we see an increase in the organization of production in the individual workshop. Another contradiction emerges, an antagonism between the strict organization of production within firms, but total disorganization between them. 

The anarchy of production turns more and more people into proletarians through economic contractions. This further strengthens the proletariat. 

Competition compels the capitalist to perfect their machinery, reducing the number of workers needed. This creates a “surplus population” or a reserve army of labor. These people are employed during the high point in productive cycles, and cast out during the lull or contraction. They keep [[wages]] down by increasing competition between workers for employment. In this way, the product of the worker is turned into a tool for their subjugation. 

By seeking to maximize profits in the selling of goods to the population, and to minimize costs in wages to that same population, a surplus of goods is inevitable. This is why capitalists always seek new markets: both for the raw goods and for the population of new consumers. 

This fundamental imbalance jolts the system about every 10 years. The market becomes glutted, factories close, many become unemployed and many die. The crisis only ends when enough of the means of production are destroyed to erase the glut of commodities. 

The fundamental problem is that the mode of production is incompatible with the mode of exchange. The organization of the factory is incompatible with the disorganization of the economy. The social production of goods is incompatible with the private ownership of them. 

Eventually, even the economy in total moves towards socialization. Trusts and conglomerates are formed, because social production is simply more effective than the workings of individual firms. Whole industries are monopolized. See [[Lenin]]'s work, [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]].

Increasingly, [[state]] management of the economy is inevitable, as the [[bourgeoisie]] demonstrate their incapability for managing a more and more complex system. This state management does not solve the contradictions, but brings them to a head. Production has become social throughout all of society, but appropriation is starkly individual. 

This is interesting, because at our late capitalist stage, the state has mostly avoided direct economic management through the use of large corporations and the banks. 

This contradiction can only be resolved by transforming individual ownership into social ownership. The only class in a position to do this is the [[proletariat]]. The proletariat will centralize ownership in a state that it controls, and this will do away with the state. As a tool of class repression, when there are no longer any class-enemies of the proletariat, there will be no need for a state. 

## Reading Questions
1. What major changes in the division of labour and productive forces have taken place in recent decades, and what political and social changes have been associated with these changes?
2. How would you apply Engels' observation that “the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange” to a major social movement of our times, such as the political polarisation across the West?
3. Engels refers to the arrival of planned production with the factory system. Exactly what did he mean by this?
4. Engels places a lot of emphasis on production of “commodities”. What is a commodity?

6. What does Engels mean by the “rebellion of the productive forces”, and what are the “productive forces”?
7. Engels says “This solution can only consist in the practical recognition of the social nature of the modern forces of production, and therefore in the harmonizing with the socialized character of the means of production”. How are the forces of production socialised under capitalism?
