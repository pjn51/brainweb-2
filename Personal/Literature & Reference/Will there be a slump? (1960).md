This article sets out to criticize the theories of other '[[Marxism|Marxist]]' groups and thinkers who failed to predict the post-[[WW2]] upswing and then pivoted dramatically towards theories that [[capitalism]] had developed the ability to avoid crisis. This includes [[Tony Cliff]] who thought that a 'permanent arms economy' was capable of stimulating the economy to avoid downturns (printout, p.1). 

[[Ted Grant]] begins by arguing that despite unique historical factors in the mid-20th century, the fundamental laws of capitalism had not changed. He says that [[The rate of profit tends to fall]] and the trade cycle was still visible. He also explains that production has grown along the same lines as before, with the [[surplus value]] of the [[proletariat]] extracted and re-invested in production (Ibid, p.2).  

He goes on to explain that competition between capitalists spurred investment in constant capital, and the increasing proportion of [[capital]] invested in machinery and infrastructure relative to wages gives life to the tendency for the rate of profit to fall, as it always has in this system (Ibid, p.3). Note that [[The organic composition of capital is the ratio of variable and constant capital]]. 

Grant also notes that [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]], a fact that has not changed in the postwar situation. He argues that the crisis of overproduction, both in capital goods and consumer goods, is still the fundamental crisis of capitalism. He tells us that this is due to the division of society into antagonistic classes, and the anarchy of the market (Ibid, p.3). 

Turning to the political situation, Grant cites [[Trotsky]], who says that there is no crisis that capitalism cannot claw itself out of, at the cost of the working class. Grant agrees, and says that the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] theories about the Third Period and the final crisis of capitalism were foolish. He argues that the workers must find a way out of capitalism through revolution to end the crises once and for all (Ibid, p.4). In sum, [[Capitalism has no final crisis]]. 

Grant now lists the fundamental reasons for the upswing after the war. He gives prominence first of all to the political failure of the Stalinsts and Social Democrats to lead the working class out of capitalism, and says that the decisive economic factor that allowed for the upswing was an increased scope of capital investment (Ibid, p.5-6). All in all, [[Stalinism is counter-revolutionary]]. 

Grant counters the arguments of revisionists who claim that state involvement has changed the character of capitalism. He says that the end of *laissez faire* was already discussed by [[Marx]] and [[Engels]], and says that [[Lenin]] discussed the increasing involvement of the [[state]] in the economy in his work, [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]]. He notes that the state subsidies to the capitalists, state denationalization of newly profitable industries, and state investment in unprofitable industries, demonstrate the the state sector is the servant of the private sector (Ibid, p.7-8). This is an important point that is often missed by those on the left. [[Nationalization isn't inherently socialist]]. 

Grant argues that while the standard of living for workers has risen after the way, their percentage of the pie has actually fallen. He cites the fact that the percentage of national production going to consumer goods has fallen from 67% in 1938 to around 54% in 1957 (Ibid, p.8). 

Arguing against revisionist ideas that the state is beginning to dominate the economy, Grant says that state expenditure only makes up 20% of the national income. He says that while this is substantial, it is still the market that leads the state industries, not the other way around. Grant goes on to say that it is impossible for the state to smooth over capitalist crises, because they really only have three options as to the source of their funds: debt, taxing the income of the capitalists, or taxing the income of the workers. If they go into debt, Grant continues, this will lead to inflation. On the other hand, he says, if they tax the capitalists, this will decrease the amout of capital invested, while taxing the workers will decrease the ability of the workers to absorb the commodities pushed by the capitalist (Ibid, p.9). This deserves its own note: [[The state cannot avert capitalist crisis]]. 

Since the main factor in the recovery was an increase in capital investment, Grant says, some argue that the state should just increase investment in the state sector, including things like armaments, roads, and schools. However, he continues, these investments can only occur during an upswing, and cannot themselves cause one. He summarizes that these monetary policies follow the economy, not the other way around (Ibid, p.10).
