> In this book, David Graeber proposes a theory explaining the origin of so-called "bullshit jobs," and analyzes their social impact. 

# Preface: on the phenomenon of bullshit jobs
Graeber cites [[Keynes]], who predicted 15-hour work weeks by the end of the 20th century. He asks why this didn't happen, and argues that technology has been "marshalled... to figure out ways to make us all work more." He says that this has resulted in an increase in jobs that are totally pointless (7). 

He says that between 1910 and 2000, professional, managerial, clerical, sales, and service jobs have gone from 25% to 75% of total employment, and argues that "productive jobs" have been automated away (7). I think that calling all of these jobs non-productive is a serious stretch. 

His basic view is that it appears that there's a proliferation of these useless functions, just to make sure everyone is working. He asks how this could be, saying that [[capitalism]] is supposed to prevent this sort of thing, unlike "the old inefficient [[socialism|Socialist]] states" (7). 

Now, in my opinion, he makes a serious error:

> The answer clearly isn't economic: it's moral and political. The [[bourgeoisie|ruling class]]has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger (8). 

Moving on to the psychological effects of this phenomenon, he says that this must erode dignity of labor when [[proletariat|workers]] view their own work as pointless. Furthermore, he notes a general rule that the more useful one's work is, the less one gets paid (9). 

Graeber says that when [[UK|British]] workers were polled on their perception of the value of their work, 37% said that their work wasn't contributing to society (11). 

The author supports this argument by saying that free market reforms have caused economic slowdown and stagnation - but we've still enacted them, and if we were really motivated by economic factors, we would have changed course (12). 

> [!critique] 
> Here, I must stop to critique this line of reasoning so far. It seems that Graeber mis-identifies the increasing [[alienation]] of the modern workforce with a genuine lack of productivity. The professional sphere of work has greatly increased the specialization of labor, to the point that no individual worker can really see the output of their efforts in a meaningful way. However, this does not mean that their work is not producing value, or improving the efficiency, security, or speed of the production process.

While yes, controlling overworked and precarious workers is easier than those with disposable time, no individual capitalist could make that sort of choice. It is the *natural laws* of capitalism that pushes us into the crisis, not a deliberate choice by the capitalists.

> If administative work really wasn't productive, sooner or later, the declining rate of profit would force company after company to shed this dead weight, dragging their competitors along with them. Sooner or later, all the corporate lawyers, HR represenatives, and marketers would be laid off. The fact that we don't see this happening means that either *every* capitalist is so politically united that they would rather bankrupt themselves than deviate from their holy mission, or Graeber is incorrect and these professions do generate profits.
