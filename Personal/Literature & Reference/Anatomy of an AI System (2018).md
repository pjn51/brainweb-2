# 1
The authors explain that this is an anatomical map of the Amazon Echo AI system that undergirds the functions of the device.

# 2
The article argues that the extent of the resources involved in a simple Alexa command, such as turning on the lights, is almost impossible to comprehend, involving "a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and [[data]]." 

# 4
The authors say that there are three main processes that are needed to run an AI system of this scale: human labor, raw materials, and data. 

# 6
Discussing the role of the user in this process, the authors argue that the user is simultaneously a consumer, a resource, a worker, and a product. They are of course a consumer as they have purchased the device, they continue, but the user is also providing valuable feedback that will train the [[neural network]] behind the product. 

# 9
The authors argue that the work of building and maintaining digital systems is exploitive, and I would tend to agree. [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]] including digital work. They include a visualization of [[Marx]]'s "dialectic of subject and object."

```
                              Product of labor
                              (subject-object)
                                 /         \
                                /           \
                         Labor power ---- Means of production
                          (subject)           (object)
```

The authors extend that dialectic and repeat it, arguing that the anatomy of this system exists as a fractal of these triangles extending in multiple directions. 

# 11
Discussing the complexity of supply chains, the article says that it took Intel more than 4 years to audit its own supply chain to ensure no tantalum was being bought from militants in the Congo. This is an illustration of how [[Supply chains are becoming more complex]]. 

# 12
The article examines the shipping industry. They say that [[Standardized cargo containers were a breakthrough]] and that [[Overseas shipping is pollution-intensive]]. 

# 13
The authors explain that [[Rare earth elements are essential for tech manufacturing]], and that [[Rare earth elements are destructive to produce]]. 

# 17
Discussing the energy footprint of cloud computing, the authors note that AWS refuses to disclose the carbon impact of its services. They also explain that while open-source packages for [[machine learning]] and the ability to rent computational power have made barriers to entry lower, data is amassed at a staggering rate by the large tech players, who exploit its value to expand their profits and overpower competitors. 

# 18
The authors explain that behind many machine learning and AI systems there is a great deal of human annotation and other labor. 

# 19
They say that by attempting to create an absolute image of reality, AI systems capture the biases and sterotypes found in our society and project them into the future, hardwiring them into predictive engines and other tools.
