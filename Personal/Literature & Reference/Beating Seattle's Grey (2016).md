# Review 
This is an interesting and well done book about how to reduce Seasonal Affective Disorder during the winter in [[Seattle]]. 

The main ideas are that spending time outdoors is much more valuable than indoor time when it comes to light level. Furthermore, fresh air is linked with reducing depression and increasing health.
