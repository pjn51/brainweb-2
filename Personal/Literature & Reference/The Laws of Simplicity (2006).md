# The Laws of Simplicity (2006)
#book 

---
This book deals with a central topic: [[The dialectic of complexity and simplicity]]. This book is okay, but there doesn't seem to be that many benefits to reading the "ten laws and three keys" of simplicity. I flipped through the book to discover that in addition to these ten laws and three keys, there are numerous acronyms that one ought to remember in order to achieve simplicity. Pretty ironic, and none of them seem to be that deep.
