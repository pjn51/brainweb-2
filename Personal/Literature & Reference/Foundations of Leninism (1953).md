> This is a book about the legacy of [[Lenin]]'s political theory, written by the "gravedigger of the revolution," Joseph [[Stalin]]. I guess this would be a central political theory of [[Stalinism]]? If they even really had theory that is.

## Introduction
Stalin begins by stating that he cannot "exhaust" the foundations of Leninism in a single volume, or even many volumes. Instead, he says that he intends to offer a "concise synopsis" of the foundations of Leninism. 

He says that even though Lenin's world outlook was based in [[Marxism]], we don't need to expound a foundations of Marxism to understand Lenin's ideas which he "contributed ot the general treasury of Marxism."

Stalin says that some say Leninism is the application of Marxism to conditions in [[Russia]], but Stalin disagrees. He asserts that this is one sided and would mean that the lessons of Leninism apply only to Russia, whereas he argues that Leninism is an international phenomenon.

Additionally, Stalin thinks that others say Leninism is the revival of the revolutionary ideas of Marxism that were supressed by the [[Second International]]. Stalin believes that Lenin did resurrect the revolutionary teachings of Marxism, but says that it's foolish to try and divide Marxism into revolutionary and non-revolutionary content. 

Stalin argues that Leninism is Marxism in the era of [[imperialism]]. He claims that Lenin "pursued his activities in the period...of the unfolding proletarian revolution, when the proletarian revolution had already triumphed in one country."

## The historical roots of Leninism
Stalin asserts that Lenin called imperialism "moribund capitalism" because it carries the contradictions of [[capitalism]] to "their last bounds, to their extreme limit, beyond which revolution begins."

> [!criticism]
> This is a very mechanical way of looking at revolution. Contradictions reach final point -> revolution starts! This seems to be related to Stalin's claim that the Third Period represented the "final crisis" of capitalism. 

Stalin outlines the three contradictions that he says are the most important. First, he discusses the contradiction between [[labor]] and [[capital]], saying that the "customary methods" of the workers ([[unions]], parliamentary parties, and cooperatives) have proved to be totally inadequate in the struggle against imperialist domination of the trusts and syndicates.

Stalin tells us that the second contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperalist powers. Stalin explains that this leads to imperalist wars of annexation, which he claims leads to the mutual weakening of the position of capitalism in general and the acceleration of the advent of the proletarian revolution. 

To Stalin, the third contradiction is the contradiction between the ruling countries and the colonial countries. Stalin says that the same process that is meant to "squeeze out super-profits" from the colonial world also builds railroads, develops the proletariat, and awakens the national liberation movement. In this way, Stalin argues that these colonial countries are transformed from "reserves of imperialism into reserves of proletarian revolution." 

Stalin now says that Leninism developed in Russia because Russia was "the focus of all these contradictions of imperialism." He argues that Tsarism was a major ally to Western Imperialism, and that it allowed foreign capital to control the economy while providing troops to defend the profits of the [[UK]] and [[France]] during [[WW1]]. 

> [!criticism]
> This is an ok cursory analysis, but I find the analysis of Russia in [[Results and Prospects (1905)]] much deeper.

Stalin, seemingly embracing the theory of [[permanent revolution]], says that the workers' and peasants' movement in Russia "could not stop half-way, that in the event of success it was bound to advance further and raise the banner of revolt against imperialism." 

Stalin says that under these condtions, it was imperative for the Russian Communists expand their work to the international arena. 

Stalin remarks that it was a similar situation that unfolded in [[Germany]] in the 1840s that caused [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] to develop their theories of scientific socialism in that country.

> [!criticism]
> I agree with Stalin's surprising claim that the Russian revolution was bound to progress to a socialst one due to the international situation of imperialism, and that the work of communists must be international in order to prevent the re-establishment of the bourgeois order, since this was the position of [[Trotsky]], who Stalin was in the process of assasinating when this was written.

## Method
Stalin expounds a history of the time between Marx & Engels, and Lenin. He says that the [[Second International]] was dominated, in reality, by [[opportunism]]. He says that "the opportunists adapted themselves to the bourgeois because of their adaptive, petty-bourgeois nature."

He explains this by saying that this was the pre-war period, where the contradictions of capitalism were less evident, and when the [[reformism|Social Democratic]] parties could still dream of killing capitalism through legal methods.

Stalin turns towards the methods that he says Leninism used to "clean the stables" of the Second International. First, he argues that the dogmas of the Second International were tested in the crucible of struggle.

Secondly, Stalin asserts that the parties of the Second International were tested based on their actions rather than their dogmas in order to win the confidence of the workers.

Thirdly, Stalin tells us that all Party work was reorganized on new revolutionary lines, in order to prepare the masses for struggle.

Fourthly, Stalin claims that the proletarian parties embraced self-criticism and education on their past mistakes. He says that these four methods are the foundations of Leninist method.

> [!criticism]
> For an attempt to generalize the lessons of Leninism into the international arena, Stalin does a poor job of removing the history of Lenin's ideas from their historical context. This is just a timeline of what Lenin did, not the real essense of his ideas. 
> 
> If Stalin were trying to describe the essence of what it means to be a mechanic, he would remember when he was last in the shop, and recall that the mechanic checked the tire pressure, then the headlights, and then replaced his battery.
> 
> Seeing this, Stalin would remark that the essense of being a mechanic is to first check the tires, then check the lights, and then replace the battery!

Discussing how these 'essential' methods were applied, Stalin starts with what he calls the first dogma of the Second International: that the proletariat cannot and should not take power unless it constitutes the majority of society. Stalin criticizes this dogma by saying that the workers could take power if backed by the revolutionary [[peasantry]], and notes that Marx and Lenin agreed on this point.

Stalin claims that the second dogma is that only capitalist development allows the creation of "trained cultural and administrative cadres" who can administer the country. He criticizes this, saying that after a proletarian revolution, the condition for the appearance of these cadres could be brought about quickly. 

> [!criticism]
> I disagree with the "second dogma," but I also think Stalin's critique is clumsy. If the assertion is that only skilled cadres could administer the country, who is supposed to bring about "favorable conditions" for the development of such a group?

Stalin says that the third dogma is that the workers cannot accept the method of political general strike because it is unsound in theory and dangerous in practice, as it disturbs the normal course of events and drains the funds of the unions involved.
