> This is one of the foundational texts of [[Anarchism]], written by one of the most well-known anarchists, ex-Prince Peter Kropotkin. 

# Preface
The author says that one of the current arguments against [[socialism]] is that it's impossible to reach the kind of ideal society that is imagined. He says that lots of cultures had visions of ideal states, so why is socialism any different?

According to Kropotkin, the critics object, "Don't you think there's something wrong with your understanding of the needs of society?" But when Kropotkin considers the real history of humanity, he says that common ownership of the land has been the norm for most of our existence. According to him, the only way this tradition was ended was by the direct force of the states of Western Europe. 

Interestingly, he pays no mind to the question of why, out of this free association, the states of Western Europe developed. 

The author also says that free cities in Europe had  a kind of communal management of trade and business that was only done away with by "the rise of military states." 

Kropotkin says that when we really look at history, it appears as a succession of attempts to realize the communist vision. The author says we must conclude that the only reason [[communism]] hasn't been achieved is that humanity has not found the correct method in which to combine rural and urban society, in light of the modern economic situation.

[[idealism]] much? Humanity apparently just hasn't found out how to make communism happen. This is almost a satirical paragraph, and is almost directly made fun of in Marxist texts about materialism and the movement of humanity towards socialism. This is about as useful as saying, "The reason I'm not a billionaire is because I just haven't had a good business idea."

The author goes on to describe the foundation of 'modern socialism' which would be described as utopian socialism by [[Marx]], whose name is conspicuously absent from the list. 

Kropotkin described the common features of these thinkers. They looked upon themselves as founders of a new [[religion]], and sought to regulate its progress like priests in church. They did not trust the masses, having seen the period of reaction after the revolution in [[France]]. 

Instead, the author argues, these thinkers placed their faith in a benign ruler that would understand the doctrine of socialism and accomplish the revolution. It was only during the period from 1840-1848 when these thinkers began to trust the masses again. 

Kropotkin outlines the progession of thought in relation to the historical ebbs and flows of the workers' movement. As upsurges crashed, these thinkers no longer trusted the masses, and then their hopes were rekindled during a new swing left. 

He says that he intends to give a working out of the ideas that developed after the Paris commune - that the new order would be a federation of communes, as opposed to what he calls the idea of the "State Socialists."

Looking backward after the book was published, Kropotkin is confident in his assertions. He says that while state activity has emerged "here and there," each new intervention of the state has proved to be an obstacle in the liberation of the workers. He argues that the workers believe that complex enterprises could be better managed by confederations of workers than by the state. 

Summing up the preface, Kropotkin discusses the path forward. He sees the task at hand to be an intellectual synthesis of all the good ideas that have resulted from experimentation in different social forms. He argues that once the correct course of action is worked out, then we might find the expression of a communist society. 

This is a thoroughly anti-materialist document. The idea that humanity just hasn't thought of the right way to do [[communism]] is incorrect, in my view. I think that the question of class society is not a question of secret knowledge, but a question of power. We don't have to devise some kind of grand plan for working out communism, we merely have to place the power in the hands of the workers and allow them to act in their own self-interest. Over time, they themselves will work out the ideal structure of the machinery of society. To sit back and argue that we have to first develop an entire plan of "uniting town and country" is armchair revolutionism at best.

Kropotkin outlines his vision of the progress of humanity so far. We started in pre-civilization, with no posessions passed from generation to generation. However, we still amassed wealth by trans
