> [!Abstract]
> In this short article, written just before the outbreak of [[WW1]], Kautsky attempts to argue that a new phase of capitalism may arise, one in which war is extinguished by a "holy alliance" of countries that have "renounced the arms race."

In this article, [[Kautsky defines imperialism as agrarian expansionism]]. 

> What [[Marx]] said of [[capitalism]] can also be applied to imperialism: monopoly creates competition and competition monopoly. The frantic competition of giant firms, giant banks and multi-millionaires obliged the great financial groups, who were absorbing the small ones, to think up the notion of the cartel. In the same way, the result of the World War between the great [[imperialism|imperialist]] powers may be a federation of the strongest, who renounce their arms race.
> 
> Hence from the purely economic standpoint it is not impossible that capitalism may still Jive through another phase, the translation of cartellization into foreign policy: a phase of ultra-imperialism, which of course we must struggle against as energetically as we do against imperialism, but whose perils lie in another direction, not in that of the arms race and the threat to world peace.

This is the article in which [[Kautsky proposed the theory of ultra-imperialism]], and it's every bit as pathetic as [[Lenin]] makes it out to be when [[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]].
