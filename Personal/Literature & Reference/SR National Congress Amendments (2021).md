# Introduction
This is a compilation of the proposed amendments to the constitution, US perspectives document, and organizational resolution for the 2021 National Congress of Socialist Revolution. 

# US perspectives
## USP1
The STL2 branch wants to include some language specifying that some of the improvised self-defense organizations from the BLM uprising were led by NAACP and AIM. They say that we should not paint these as spontaneous developments when "organizations of the oppressed" were behind some. 

Comrade Erika from Minneapolis says that the NAACP didn't play a leading role, and showed up afterwards to formalize the process. 

> [!note]
> I'm not sure what my position on this is. I don't know enough about the situation.
> 
> ---
> The CC recommends accepting. 

## USP2
The CNJ branch wants to include a paragraph to discuss the slogan of "Abolish the police" as a part of the BLM uprising, highlighting the utopian nature of abolishing the police without abolishing the bourgeois state itself. 

The CC proposes rewording this new text to fit in with the rest of the piece, and argues that the original USP2 proposal attempts to summarize a complex issue in too few lines. 

> [!support]
> I tenatively agree that this seems like a good analysis of a qualitative change in the movement's slogans. 
> 
> ---
> I agree with the CC counterproposal, but I think the political content of the amendment should be included. Looking forward to hearing the CC justification. 

## USP3
The STL2 branch wants to include a few paragraphs discussing Puerto Rico's liberation movement, Hawaii, and tribal struggles within the United States. 

The CC recommends rejecting this proposal, saying that we must analyze thse issues on a much deeper level than in a few short paragraphs, and they say that material should be developed on each of these topics, rather than just to plop a few paragraphs in here. 

> [!note]
> I agree with the sentiment that we should be aware of these struggles, I find some wording questionable. The paragraphs refer to "internal colonies" which is often associated with Sakai's analysis. I think that while the amendment is correct in that the national liberation struggle is present, they might be overstating the case in saying that we should defend the right of minorities to call for national liberation. It seems like we should just be trying to move people in a class-struggle direction.
> 
> At the end of the day, I agree with the CC's rejection of this amendment. 

## USP4
The PGH branch wants to replace the term "Black people" with "oppressed minorities" when discussing the efforts to limit voting rights. 

The CC supports retaining "Black people" and adding "and other oppressed minorities," saying that it's important to highlight that the Black community is a specific target of this

> [!note]
> I tenatively agree with this amendment, since we should seek to unite oppressed groups whenever possible and not engage in any sort of "oppression olympics" when determining which specific minority ought to get the most recognition. 
> 
> I also think the CC counter-proposal makes a lot of sense too. 

## USP5
The STL2 branch proposes removing a description of our critique of critical race theory. They argue that by doing so, we are making a bogeyman out of the term. They also say that we adequately cover this in the rest of the section. 

The CC advises us to reject this proposal, saying that our dedication to Marxist philosophy requires us to have a position on CRT. 

> [!note]
> I disagree with this one. I don't think that it was mentioned at all elsewhere, and I think it is useful for Marxists to formulate our own opposition to this petty bourgeois, academic method of analysis. 
> 
> I agree with the CC's call to reject this amendment. 

## USP6
The STL2 branch recommends reordering the section on oppression and culture war, saying that we should avoid implying that the right and the left are united in their attack on critical race theory. 

The CC recommends rejection, saying that when read in context, no honest reader would think that we are united with the right against CRT. 

> [!note]
> I'm open to this, but again, it seems that the STL2 branch is a little too friendly with the ideas of CRT, which as Marxists we should oppose even if Republicans also oppose it. 

## USP7
The PGH branch proposes replacing "internalized, interpersonal, institutional, and structural racism" with "oppression and bigotry big and small," saying that we shouldn't use the language of critical race theorists that we oppose. 

The CC counter-proposal replaces "internalized" with unconscious, saying that they did not intend to carry some of the baggage that "internalized" has, but says that the rest of the sentence is valid.

> [!note]
> I'm on the fence about this one, since many people discuss the idea of internalized racism, and replacing those terms makes the point less clear. On the other hand, I agree with the justification that we should not use the langauge of those with whom we disagree. The CC conter-proposal makes a lot of sense.

## USP8
The PHL3 branch recommends adding clarifying a discussion on the rising productivity of the economy by specifying that this is due to the increasing intensification of labor and an extension of the working day. 

The CC issued a counter-proposal, saying that it is true that economic productivity is rising for these reasons, but clarifies that this does not allow capitalism any escape from the forces that work against its success. 

> [!note]
> I don't feel like I know enough about the situation to comment on this one. I agree with the CC counter-proposal I suppose.

## USP9
The PGH branch proposes adding a disclaimer to a statement predicting Weimar-style inflation, saying that in the past, other economic forces have prevented such an event from happening, such as the deflation of prices. They say that we must distinguish ourselves from the "Dr. Dooms," who claim apocalypse at every turn.

The CC recommends rejecting this proposal, and says that they disagree that we may be conflated with bourgeois [[empiricism|empiricists]] by making claims about impending collapse. 

> [!note]
> To me, this seems reasonable, but maybe that's because I'm not totally seeing the inevitability of crisis. We should seek to make our message as sober and reasonable as possible, but on the other hand we shouldn't water it down at all, and this proposal seems to water it down. 

## USP10
The CNJ branch proposes clarifying that it was not only the increased demand for products during [[WW2]] which ended the Great Depression, but also the direct [[economic planning]] that the state undertook. They say that this sets us apart from the proponents of [[Keynesianism]]. 

The CC amends this proposal to make it flow more with the overall text while keeping the main message. 

> [!note]
> I agree with the CC's counter-proposal.

## USP11
Comrades Charlie F and Nick B want to include a number of paragraphs to discuss the independence of Puerto Rico and the role that democratic demands play in the revolutionary party. 

# Organizational resolution
## OR2
The PGH branch proposes adding a paragraph to explain that the prevalence of white male comrades in the organization can be explained through the fact that "political movements always tend to originate in those with the resources...that the majority of the population is denied."

The CC rewords this proposal to keep the main points without making generalizations that protests *always* start with these kinds of people. 

> [!support]
> I agree with the main thrust of this amendment, but I think the wording could be improved. We can see that not all political movements begin with these folks, as with the BLM protests. 
> 
> I agree with the CC counter-proposal.

# US IMT program
## P1
The PGH branch proposes making some clarifications and shortenings of the program when discussing minimum wage demands. They argue that we should remove "for those unable to work" from the sentence "Unemployment benefits and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages for those unable to work." Their reasoning is that we stand for full employment, and the obligation of all those who are able to work to do so.

> [!support]
> I agree with the majority of this proposal, but the point on being able to work seems pedantic to me. Those words aren't saying what the authors of this proposal think they're saying.

## P2

## P3
The STL2 branch advocates removing the stipulation that a social housing plan would be voluntary. They say that "voluntary" confuses the demand, and that we shouldn't be making concessions to the tiny layer of landlords. 

> [!support]
> I agree for the most part.

## P4
The PGH branch wants to slightly reword our demand for social healthcare, and clarify that disease cannot be eradicated in general, only combatted. 

> [!support]
> Sure, why not. Not changing the meaning that much.

## P5
The CNJ branch wants to replace "sexual preference" with "sexual orientation."

> [!support]
> I agree. 

## P6
The BAY branch wants to replace the slogan "For the unity of the working class!" with "Fight racism with class struggle!" as a slogan. 

> [!support]
> I agree! The unity slogan seems kind of bad.

## P7
The STL2 branch wants to include the right to self-determination of [[USA|American]] colonies in our program. They say that the Leninist conception of the right of nations to self-determination holds true in the US which is an empire. 

The CC wants to reject this proposal, saying that the majority of the people in these communities don't want "national self-determination," including in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. 

> [!note]
> I'm torn on this one. I do agree that we should support the right of all communities for self-determination as part of a socialist society, but I just don't know if the national liberation movements in Puerto Rico and Hawaii are more of a proletarian thing or a petty bourgeois thing. 
> 
> It seems like the CC is saying that the support for such things just isn't there yet, and I would counter that the support for socialism and nationalization isn't there yet either! A rejection of this amendment should be motivated by more precise arguments than saying that this isn't something that the masses want.
