# Key ideas
- Lenin criticized Economism
- Lenin proposed the newspaper as collective organizer
- Lenin called the slogan of "freedom of criticism" an opportunist cover
- Lenin fought against eclecticism
- [[Revolutionaries, to Lenin, must be tribunes of the people]]

Lenin displays an honest method of debate, refusing to sincerely argue with those whose arguments are dishonest or inept, but straightforwardly debating the arguments made by worthy enemies (162). 

Lenin argues that far from being a distraction or a diversion from concrete political work, the establishment of an all-Russian newspaper would be the best facilitator of such work, and would bring it to a new level (168). He goes on to say that the distribution of such a paper would naturally draw new contacts to the organization, and would raise the horizons of local work (174). 

The author says that the art of politics is finding the pressure point in society, or in his metaphor, the link on the social chain that can most easily be grabbed in order to possess the whole chain (169). 

Countering claims that "armchair work" would lead to revolutionaries missing the revolution, Lenin argues that political agitation is the best way to *prepare* for the revolution - both preparing the masses by elevating their consciousness, and preparing the revolutionaries for their coming role as leaders of the revolution and guiders of the masses (181). 

Lenin views revolution as a process, saying that it won't be one event, but will be made up of periods of crisis and chaos, puncutated by relatively calm periods. He says that only political agitation such as *Iskra* was doing would put the organization in a prime position for carrying out activities in both periods (182).

# Preface
Lenin says that this pamphelt is needed to fight against the tendency of [[Economism]], expressed in *Rabocheye Dyelo.* He says that this became a much larger task than he expected, resulting in the current book. 

The author explains that the current work expanded from a critique of the above-mentioned journal into an exposition on political goals, tactics, the relationship between [[unions|union]] politics and Social-Democratic ones, and a call for the creation of an all-Russian militant organization, through the scaffolding of a newspaper. 

He finishes by saying that the debate with *Rabocheye Dyelo* is important because the latter represents not only Economism, but the confused vaccilation of a whole historical period of the Russian socialist movement. 

# 1. Dogmatism and "freedom of criticism"
## A. What does "freedom of criticism" mean?
Lenin begins by posing the question of what this slogan even means. He says that an onlooker would be right to be confused since nobody is really opposed to freedom of criticism. 

He continues, saying that a new tendencies have emerged within the social democratic movement. The new one, he says, has adopted a critical attitude towards what they see as dogmatic, orthodox [[Marxism]]. He attributes [[Bernstein]] and Millerand to this trend. 

He notes that it's actually a good thing that such differences have moved from the national to the international plane, signifying a more connected worldwide movement. 

Lenin explains that Bernstein argues social revolution must be replaced by social reforms, and how Bernstein totally abandones the dictatorship of the [[proletariat]], the class struggle, a serious analysis of [[capitalism]], and ultimately abandones Marxism itself, and that he justifies this by saying such ideas don't apply to a democratic society that is run by majority rule.

Lenin says that those who demand a turn from revolution to reform have also begun criticism of a whole range of Marxist ideas, and that they have been spurred on by support from [[academy|academics]], the media, and other representatives of the [[bourgeoisie]]. 

Turning to [[France]], Lenin says we can see the full implementation of Bernstein's ideas in Millerand. He explains that the French socialists have entered a bourgeois cabinet, and totally betrayed the principle of [[class independence]]. He calls out these "socialist" ministers for standing with the [[state]] after the killings of workers, and even personally welcoming the Tsar on an official visit. 

Lenin summarizes this new "critical" trend as a blantant example of [[opportunism]]. Therefore, he says that their slogan of "freedom of criticism" really means the freedom to convert the socialist movement into a reformist one, and the freedom to introduce bourgeois ideas into the movement. 

> Those who are really convinced that they have made progress in science would not demand freedom for the new views to continue side by side with the old, but the substitution of the new views for the old. 

> We are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and difficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand. We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to advance almost constantly under their fire. We have combined, by a freely adopted decision, for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not of retreating into the neighbouring marsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead of the path of conciliation. And now some among us begin to cry out: Let us go into the marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort: What backward people you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the liberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes, gentlemen! You are free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves wherever you will, even into the marsh. In fact, we think that the marsh is your proper place, and we are prepared to render you every assistance to get there. Only let go of our hands, don’t clutch at us and don’t besmirch the grand word freedom, for we too are “free” to go where we please, free to fight not only against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards the marsh!

## B. The new advocates of "freedom of criticism"
Lenin turns back to *Rabocheye Dyelo,* saying that their demand for freedom of criticism must mean that they seek freedom for an opportunist current to exist within the socialist movement. 

Lenin quotes the editor of the journal, who says that there are no internal class antagonisms within the socialist movement, and that all tendencies stand for the interests of the proletariat. Lenin calls this a bold assertion, and argues that it is the participation of a broad academic layer in the movement that allowed for the spread of Bernstein's ideas. He accuses the editor of taking the Bernstein tendency's description of itself as gospel truth. 

Lenin says we must use history to judge whether or not the Bernsteins stand for the working class, and that we can do so by looking at the effects their ideas resulted in when put into practice in the French movement. 

The author accuses *R.D.* of playing a game of hide-and-seek to avoid having to defend Bernstein's ideas, while creating room for the very same ideas within the movement. 

## C. Criticism in Russia
Lenin describes the "heyday of 'Legal Marxism'" that he says was caused by the unity of heterogenous tendencies under a common banner in the early socialist movement in Russia. He says that this was a bizzare period where the censored press became overflowing with the language of Marxism. Explaining this, he notes that the Tsar regarded any critique of the [[Narodiks]] as a good thing, and regarded only that group as truly dangerous. 

Lenin says that this was only possible through an alliance of the radical and moderate socialists. He argues that this was okay at the time, since all political movements sometimes require entering into alliance with unreliable elements. 

The author says that an alliance with the bourgeois democrats is useful insofar as the democratic demands of the bourgeois revolution are on the agenda. However, he says that in any alliance, the socialist elements must reserve the right to explain how the interests of the workers and the capitalists are totally opposed. However, Lenin continues, the Bernsteinians refused this opportunity, and demoralized the movement by confining it to narrow trade unionism and demands for reforms. To Lenin, *this* was why the break with the bourgeois elements was needed, not the fact that the latter were indeed bourgeois. 

Lenin explains how the *Credo* of the Economists gained a bad reputation because it was such an accurate description of the former's actual views: that the workers ought to struggle in the trade unions while the Marxists work in the political struggle alongside the liberals. He says that the Economists were very resistant to having their full views put on display, and these champions of "criticism" were very afraid of it being turned against themselves. 

Overall, Lenin calls for the open debate of political viewpoints, unconcealed under the banner of "freedom of criticism." He thinks that the Economists have been too scared to openly debate *with the purpose of coming to a conclusion,* and therefore seek to be protected from all criticism while being free to criticize the legacy of Marxist thought. He also says the Economists are slavishly devoted to the present movement, and are amending past theory in order to justify the existance of the present situation.

## D. Engels on the importance of the theoretical struggle
Lenin says that *R.D.* claims to be the enemy of ossification, dogmatism, and doctrinairism. He says that he's glad this topic is on the table, and asks who the judges of such characteristics are. 

He calls to our attention two publishers' announcements. One, he says, is from *R.D.* and the other is the "Announcement of the Resumption of the Publications of the Emancipation of Labor Group." Both, Lenin continues, are from 1899, when the "crisis of Marxism" was in full swing and various theoretical questions were being hotly debated. Despite this, he notes, there are no references to any theoretical points in the announcement from *R.D.* while the issues of the day are hotly debated in the *E.L.G.* document. 

Lenin decries attempts to avoid all theoretical discussion through using a quote from [[Marx]] out of context: "Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programs." Lenin says that this is taken from Marx's critique of the Gotha program, which is a rallying cry *against* the eclecticism and theoretical shallowness now evident in those who use this quote to avoid any real debate. 

> Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. This idea cannot be insisted upon too strongly at a time when the fashionable preaching of opportunism goes hand in hand with an infatuation for the narrowest forms of practical activity. 

Lenin calls on the Russian socialist movement to learn the lessons of other countries' socialist movements. He notes that [[Engels]] placed the theoretical struggle on the same pedestal as the political and economic ones. Lenin quotes the latter, who says that one major advantage of the socialist movement in [[Germany]] was that they were able to use the lessons of the earlier movements in [[France]] and the [[UK]]. 

## Reading questions
1. Can you think of any examples of workerism today?
2. In what way is pandering to the reformist milieu within the labor movement detrimental to the building of a Marxist tendency?
3. Lenin's arguments against the "freedom of criticism" are often criticized by reformists and academics alike for supposedly planting the seeds of totalitarianism. How would you respond to this criticism?
4. In what way does RD distort Marx's statement that "every step of a real movement is more important than a dozen programs?"
5. How can we best combat opportunistic tendencies within our movement?

# 2. The spontaneity of the masses and the consciousness of the social democrats
Lenin notes that up until now, all have been in agreement that the main strength of the socialist movement is the power of the industrial proletariat, and its main weakness is the lack of consciousness and initiative of the leadership. 

However, he says, R.D. is now saying that the movement has belittled the spontaneous factor. He thanks them for raising this important issue. 

## A. The beginning of the spontaneous upsurge
Lenin explains that while the strike waves that rippled across the country in the 1870s and 80s were no doubt spontaneous, but that this spontaneity represented consciousness in an embryonic form. He says that these strikes were trade union struggles instead of Social Democratic struggles, due to the lack of a socialist consciousness among the workers, which he says was not a possibility at the time. 

Here, Lenin makes what he would later say was a mistake:

> The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labor legislation, etc.

He argues that the theory of the socialist movement was borne out of "educated representatives of the propertied classes, by intellectuals." [[Lenin argued only the intelligentsia could move the workers beyond trade union consciousness]]. 

Lenin highlights an eariler era in the Russian socialist movement, when he says people understood the need for the socialist movement to have clear and conscious goals, programs, and plans, exemplified by the first issue of R.D., which was seized by the police before it could be printed. 

Lenin says that this early movement lacked experience and training, and was therefore often eclipsed by spontaneous, semi-conscious movements of the workers. However, he says, this could have been fixed rather easily, except for the fact that some theorists tried to invent a justification for this fact, and began to bow before spontaneity. 

## B. Bowing to spontaneity. *Rabochaya Mysl*
Lenin discusses the first signs of a split between the old forces of social democracy and the Economists. He says this was over whether or not various [[mutual aid]] organizations and reading circles should be subordinated to a central organization or not. 

The author explains that the publication of *Rabochaya Mysl* was the first time Economism was brought to light, of course in an uneven and gradual way. 

He says that articles in this paper talked about various stances, starting with a false antagonism between the workers and their leaders. He notes that the article actually implied the leaders were holding the workers back, and that the police arresting the lot of the leaders had freed the workers from their yoke. He also notes that the publication advocated doing away with any real political line in order to focus on the average worker, and to place the immediate struggle for economic conditions as the top priority. 
> [!note]
> To me, this stinks of [[workerism]], and [[Workerism isn't revolutionary]]. 
Lenin explains that this mood gripped the educated youth who hadn't been exposed to genuine Marxism, and that the ideas the Economists began spouting were quite similar to the right-wing trade union leadership of western Europe, who sought to lower the horizon from revolution to reform.

Ironically, Lenin says, the advent of spontaneity-worship actually took place spontaneously, because the police tended to haul away the older and more experienced comrades while more and more inexperienced youth entered the struggle each year, allowing these attractive ideas to spread quickly. He says there was no honest debate between two camps over the future of the movement. 

Based on the similarity of the arguments of Economism with the bourgeois trade union leadership, Lenin concludes that whether the Economist is aware of it or not, the tendency towards Economism has strengthened the influence of bourgeois ideology within the socialist movement. 

Lenin quotes [[Kautsky]], who makes the point that the opportunity for socialist consciousness arises from the combined factors of the class struggle and the development of science - while the former is a development of the working class, the latter is a bourgeois invention. 
> [!note]
> This is all good support for the idea that [[Marxism isn't deterministic]]. They're discussing the fact that the development of socialist consciousness isn't automatic. 
Importantly, Lenin admits that, while the working class cannot develop its own ideology, individual workers can indeed act as theoreticians if they're able to acquire an education. He notes that this is another argument for trying to raise the general level of consciousness of the workers, so that more worker-theorists can emerge. 

Lenin also underlines the fact that ideologies don't exist in a vaccum, and any loss in the strength of socialist ideology will doubtless increase the strength of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, he says that the Economists are providing a valuable help for the opportunists and bourgeois elements within the socialist movement in their dismissal of socialist ideology as useless. 

Lenin argues that the fundamental role of a socialist leadership is to combat spontaneity, and prevent the movement from proceeding only along the line of least resistance into the camp of opportunist trade-union consciousness. He says that the line of least resitance always leads to bourgeois domination because bourgeois ideology is much older, firmer, and has more means of spreading. 

## C. The Self-Emancipation Group and *Rabocheye Dyelo*
Lenin turns to the more recent events surrounding *Rabocheye Dyelo.* He says that in response to R.D., another group called the Self-Emancipation Group (SEG) responded.

In the response of the SEG, Lenin says we can find a good idea: that the workers are just instinctively grasping at the first available means of struggle, which to them is the trade union struggle. 
> [!note]
> This provides some interesting explanation for the idea that [[Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis]]. The historical organizations of the working class are going to be the first available means of struggle that the workers grasp. 
However, Lenin finds fault with a later passage. He says that the SEG fails to see that this "first available means of struggle" will be insufficient, and that the socialist movement must come to the aid of those trying to utilize it and provide a better tool. 

At the root, Lenin faults RD for first defending Economism from attack, and then falling into all the errors of Economism. He notes that RD is basically tail-ending the workers' movement. 

Lenin also critiques the idea that the socialist movement should recognize all means of struggle, and makes a medical analogy:

> To confound recognition, *in principle*, of all means of struggle, of all plans and methods, provided they are expedient, with the demand *at a given political moment* to be guided by a strictly observed plan is tantamount, if we are to talk of tactics, to confounding the recongition by medical science of various methods of treating diseases with the necessity for adopting a certain definite method of treatment for a given disease.

He's basically saying that RD argues against creating a specific plan of action and justifies this by saying that they recognize many forms of struggle. To Lenin, the movement should carefully pick, out of a wide range of possible methods, the best method for the situation and then proceed to implement it according to a conscious plan. 

> [!note]
> I see here a nice little critique of the "diversity of tactics" bullshit that I heard during the [[June 2020 uprising]], and I feel confident in saying that [["Diversity of tactics" isn't revolutionary]]. 

Lenin calls out the cowardice of RD's passivity, saying...

> That struggle is desireable which is possible, and the struggle which is possible is that which is going on at the given moment. This is precisely the trend of unbounded opportunism, which passively adapts itself to spontaneity.

Lenin says that those who argue that Marxism isn't a conscious movement reduce it to Narodnism. He goes on to say that during heated debates over the course of the movement, to remove oneself from creating plans and orientations is to just admit incompetence. 

Furthermore, Lenin attacks the very possibility of "belittling objective development." He argues that if one were to mis-understand objective conditions, this would reflect a lack of the *conscious* element that sought to grasp objective conditions, and therefore the idea of belittling objective developments is totally meaningless. 

## Reading questions
1. What is the relationship between the working class and the revolutionary leadership?
2. Can you give an example of the spontaneity of the masses going beyond trade union consciousness?
3. Why would not intervening in workers' struggles, and simply leaving it to the spontaneous movement of those involved, be a bad idea?
4. Why is dialectical materialism - the Marxist method - a crucial weapon against bourgeois ideology?

# 3. Trade-unionist politics and Social-Democratic politics
Lenin says that while the economists don't repudiate politics as such, they're constantly straying towards the trade-unionist conception of politics, rather than a socialist conception. 

## A. Political agitation and its restriction by the Economists
Lenin explains that the printing of investigative pamphlets, ones which exposed the conditions in one or another factory, was an important lever for the economic struggle, since it galvanized support and roused the workers to fight back. He says that the exposure of bad business practices "serves as a starting-point for the awakening of class-consciousness, for the beginning of a trade union struggle, and for the spread of socialism."

However, Lenin underlines the fact that this is a *beginning* point upon which to build, and not the whole of socialist work, as he said many were treating it as. He notes that the Economists, loyal slaves to spontaneity, were failing to advance *beyond* this starting point, failing to do anything more than help the workers re-negotiate the terms of their exploitation. He says that socialists must include political education in their toolbox. 

Lenin asks what this political education should consist of. He says that more than explaining that they are oppressed abstractly, socialists should expose the oppression by the ruling class specifically, in all its aspects. 

Beginning another attack on Economism, Lenin says that these thinkers argue that political agitation must follow economic agitation, and that the economic struggle is the best way to draw the workers into political struggle. Contrary to this, Lenin claims that the socialists should use *any and every* instance of oppression, political *and* economic, to agitate and propagandize the masses. He says that only a subset of these outrages are purely economic in nature, and even fewer are directly related to the trade union struggle. Lenin criticizes the Economists for limiting their political agitation to this subset of possible avenues and opportunities. 

Lenin turns to the *R.D.* slogan of "lending the economic struggle itself a political character," saying that concealed in this revolutionary sounding slogan is profound opportunism. He explains that the poltical character they're talking about is the winning of legislation that advances the demands of the workers, and ultimately reflects a trade-union consciousness. 

Defining the role of a genuine revolutionary movement, Lenin says that socialists should indeed utilize immediate reforms, but among these demands should be a demand that the bourgeois state cease to be autocratic, i.e. more radical demands for the overthrow of the existing order.  Furthermore, he says that socialists must present this demand not just on an economic front, but on all sides of the struggle. 

> [!note]
> The fact that people are interested in change which isn't immediately "palpable" is demonstrated by the [[June 2020 uprising]]. Millions went to the streets not for a wage increase, but to stand in solidarity with the victims of police brutality. What could be a less immediate demand than that?

Lenin explains that it would be a mistake to elevate economic reforms over other forms of concessions, and critiques the Economists who say that only economic demands are "concrete" or "palpable," calling to our attention the times where writers of R.D. have called for incredibly un-concrete and un-palpable economic demands.

Lenin sums up Economism by looking to a phrase of one of their authors: "Economic struggle against the employers and the government." He says that this perfectly reflects their limitations when it comes to fields of struggle beyond factory reforms. 

## B. How Martynov rendered Plekhanov more profound
Lenin criticizes Economist thinkers for ignoring the ideas of those who came before them in the movement and declaring that their own insights have brought them to conclusions that were merely stepping stones for those before them. 

Lenin quotes from Martynov, who is attempting to redefine the terms *propaganda* and *agitation* first set down by [[Plekhanov]]. The quote explains that Plekhanov called agitation the process of delivering a few ideas to many people, and propaganda the process of delivering many ideas to a few people. However, the quote argues that propaganda should instead be defined as the explanation of the social system to one or many people, and agitation should be defined as the calling of the masses into action.

Lenin riducules this position, saying that the calling of the masses into action is a big part of the work of both the propagandist and the agitator, through different means. He reasserts the validity of Plekhanov's formulation. Based on this, he defends *Iskra* from accusations that it has preferred propaganda to the detriment of agitation, saying that for the time being, *Iskra* must put the presentation of concrete economic demands to the side.

## C. Political exposures and "training in revolutionary activity"
Lenin says that the only way to "raise the activity of the working masses" is to systematically expose the real nature of the social system in both economic *and political* areas. He says that the working class should be encouraged to examine the positions of *all classes* so that they gain a clear understanding of the evils of class society, and that those who focus exclusively on issues pertaining to the working class, to the detriment of other classes such as the peasantry, play a negative role here. He argues that providing a scientific socialist worldview to the masses is essential in the process of training them for revolutionary activity, and that this can be done through "comprehensive political exposures."

Lenin argues that the socialists have done too little to expose the ruling class when its activities aren't directly attacking factory workers over economic conditions, and says that the movement must begin to expose the ruling class for *all* its misdeeds. He adds that the calling of the masses into action will organically come of such activity, since you have to expose a concrete evil in order to call for concrete action. 

Lenin says that the socialists ought not concern themselves with a job that the workers can manage themselves, and notes that it is not the socialists, but the police who usually "lend the economic struggle a political character." 

Overall, Lenin accuses the Economists of being too paternalistic in declaring the workers uninterested in political topics, as well as the general machinations of class society. He calls on the intellectuals in the workers movement, personified in the socialist organizations, to fulfull their role of bringing this information to the workers. 

## D. What is there in common between Economism and terrorism?
Lenin notes the similarities between Economism and terrorism, firstly that both bow to "different poles" of sponetaneity. He says that Economists prefer the spontaneity of the working class, ie the trade union movement, while terrorists prefer the spontaneity of the intellectuals, ie individual terrorism, disconnected from mass work. 

He goes on to criticize the ability of terrorism to "excite" the masses, saying that there are enough daily outrages without inventing more things to get angry about . He says that ultimately, both terrorists and Economists underestimate the revolutionary potential of the working class. 

## E. The working class as vanguard fighter for democracy
Lenin says that while political exposures are a vital task for the socialists in Russia, this is only because of local conditions and there are other tasks that are essential as well. He says the overall goal is to raise the political consciousness of the working class, and that such a task cannot be accomplished by keeping the movement within strictly economic bounds. 

In order to broaden the horizons of the workers, Lenin argues, the socialist movement must not tail-end the union movement, but must explain the relationships between all classes to the workers, and in order to do so, must "dispatch units of their army in all directions," not merely among the workers. 

Lenin lays out the differences between a socialist leader and a trade union leader by comparing [[Liebknecht]] with Robert Knight, a prominent British unionist at the time. He says that while the latter helped to carry out "the economic struggle against the employers and government," the former elucidated the bigger picture, the standing of all classes in society, and loudly proclaimed his socialist and democratic demands. He also notes that in Russia in that day, Social-Democratic study circles were not doing this, and were basically sticking to discussions on the grievances that workers had in their jobs. 

Lenin says that the Social Democrats have so far been able to assemble groups of workers who wish to hear a *Social* Democrat, but should also be assembling groups of all classes who wish to hear a Democrat - however he argues against concealing any socialist sentiment. He advises the socialist movement to begin organizing among all classes, supporting all revolutionary movements. 

> [!note]
> This seems very important given the strong peasantry in Russia at the time. Without a socialist presence among them, they would be less likely to stand in solidarity with the advanced workers in the cities when the time came. 

Lenin notes that liberals in Russia also want to lend the economic struggle of the workers a political character, a trade-unionist character. He makes fun of the Economist "vanguard:" a vanguard which bows before spontaneity, and fears that the conscious factor will outstrip this spontaneity, which fears to put forward a plan. He says that this vanguard should be called what it is: a rearguard!

In order to truly be a vanguard, Lenin argues, the socialist movement must cease catering to the narrow immediate interests of the workers alone, and begin pointing *all classes in society which are discontented* towards the real solution: overthrow of the autocracy. He says that the movement in 1902 now has enough resources to do this, whereas before it did not. 

Lenin says that by exposing abuses suffered by all classes and explaining them in authentically Marxist and socialist terms, the vanguard can rally the mass of the people behind it. 

> [!question]
> This need for class allies of the workers is coming from a specific historical circumstance. Are we in the same circumstances? Surely not. The working class in the US doesn't need other classes to take and hold power. How does that change the lessons of this document?

Lenin lays out the various ways that *Iskra* has exposed the nature of class society, and called on various strata of the population, from students to professionals to artisans, to move in a revolutionary direction and stand with the proletariat. 

## F. Once more "slanderers," once more "mystifiers"
Lenin criticizes the Economists for failing to see the looming danger of a bourgeois democratic future if they fail to actually lead the movement, and stop following it. He provides the [[Germany|German]] socialist movement as a postitive example, saying that their prevalence among all classes makes every political development able to be used by the movement to grow and become more powerful. 

## Reading questions
1. *Iskra,* Lenin's paper at the time, is accused of "constantly [placing] the revolutionizing of dogma higher than the revolutionizing of life." Is this a fair assessment of Lenin's arguments and conclusions?
2. What is the difference between a propagandist and an agitator? Why must a revolutionary be both?
3. Why is the conception of "the economic struggle as the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into the political movement" both a reactionary and a harmful one?
4. What are the similarities and differences between the Economists and the terrorists?
5. Does Lenin's claim that revolutionaries should be the "tribune of the people" exclude work within the trade unions?

# 4. The primitiveness of the Economists and the organization of the revolutionaries
Lenin notes that as the organizational tasks of the Economists don't require a unified national organization, one will never arise under their leadership. 

## What is primitiveness?
Lenin explains the organic development of a Marxist study circle of the time, tracing a path from a small group towards the publishing of a paper, towards open confrontation, which he says usually ends in disaster because this confrontation was not thought out well and the police already know who the leaders are from the beginning. He says that the socialist movement must develop out of this immature way of operating if it's to be successful. 

## B. Primitiveness and Economism
Lenin explains that Economist and terrorist tendencies elevate this immaturity to a theory, and bow before it, lacking faith in the revolutionary organization's ability to move past the stage of immaturity. He says that the only thing standing in the way of this happening is those who make a fetish out of immaturity. 

He says that the Economists view the mass movement as something that alleviates their duty to perform their tasks, whereas it should really be encouraging them and prodding them to do more organizing work on a broader scale.

## C. Organization of workers and oganization of revolutionaries
Lenin accuses the Economists from lapsing into trade-union organizational goals, away from socialist ones. He says that the Social-Democratic organization is different in three ways: it has to be itself a trade-union organization, which is as broad as possible, and as public as possible. He also says that the organization should consist of professional revolutionaries, effacing distinctions like worker vs intellectual. 

Lenin explains that the contradiction between the need for wide mass organizations, and the need for secrecy, is only resolved by the sepration of the trade unions from the socialist organization. 

He criticizes the official rules for a social democratic organization for basically outlining a Social Democrat's duties as being no more than a trade union executive, and for having too rigid of a structure to evade detection by police. 

Lenin says that demagogues are the worst enemy of the workers' movement, since they can mislead uneducated workers by posing as friends. 

> I assert: (1) that no revolutionary movement can endure without a stable organisation of leaders maintaining continuity; (2) that the broader the popular mass drawn spontaneously into the struggle, which forms the basis of the movement and participates in it, the more urgent the need for such an organisation, and the more solid this organisation must be (for it is much easier for all sorts of demagogues to side-track the more backward sections of the masses); (3) that such an organisation must consist chiefly of people professionally engaged in revolutionary activity; (4) that in an autocratic state, the more we _confine_ the membership of such an organisation to people who are professionally engaged in revolutionary activity and who have been professionally trained in the art of combating the political police, the more difficult will it be to unearth the organisation; and (5) the _greater_ will be the number of people from the working class and from the other social classes who will be able to join the movement and perform active work in it.

Later, Lenin remarks that "our task is not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur, but to _raise_ the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries."

## D. The scope of organizational work
Lenin says that far from having a lack of people interested in helping out, there are many whom the organization is too small to make use of. He says that by creating a centralized, professional revolutionary force, more people who only have a little time or energy to provide will be able to engage with the movement. Because of this, he explains, professionalization and centralization widens the opportunities for the masses to participate, far from shrinking it. 

## E. "Conspiratorial" organization and "Democratism"
Lenin explains that it's simply not possible for a revolutionary organization in Russia to practice total open democracy, since that would require publicity of organizational activities, which must be secret. He says that the fears of an undemocratic clique are not well founded, since [[Leadership develops organically]], and if the leadership wasn't respected by the ranks, the leaders would just be ignored. He says that the power of a revolutionary leader is dependent entirely on having the good faith and respect of the other members. 

## F. Local and All-Russia work
Lenin explains the proper relationship between local publications and the central publications that he thinks are a top priority for the movement. He says that it would be easier and better for local study circles to send in articles for an all-Russia publication than it would be for them all to publish their own papers. Furthermore, he says that such a national publication would help build a broader class consciousness across the vast country, and would allow socialists to focus on the common characteristics of the movement, leaving regional and trade issues for trade-union pamphlets, which he says journals like *R.D.* are really playing the role of anyway.
