*These are my notes from the video of the panel featuring the above speakers.*

2:32 - Sunkara says that Sweden and the USSR are just different kinds of socialism. This is fundamentally not an analysis grounded in [[Marxism]]. Marxists view these things as definite historical stages in a process, not just different ideas for how to run society that exist independently of their context. Fundamentally this indicates [[idealism]] since Sunkara seems to think that socialism is a set of good ideas that we should adopt, not one of the [[stages of historical development]].

6:56 - Sunkara demonstrates a clear lack of knowledge about the role that [[state]] plays, and even the Marxist definition of the state. He seems to think that the state is the only entity that can organize collective decisions. He seems to agree that armed bodies of men won't be needed after class is abolished, but he doesn't have any grounding in Marxist terminology. 

19:44 - Sunkara claims that the bourgeois democracy isn't a thing. It certainly is! There is a difference between the current state of democracy and the way that socialism will organize the state and economy. Sunakara seems to think that democracy is just democracy, and views the current amount of democracy that we have as something that can simply be built upon, which seems tinged with [[reformism]] to me.

23:30 - Peterson raises interesting points about the current state of the US left, including the role of the trade union leadership and the vanguard parties of the working class. 

25:30 - discussion on [[Democratic Party]] by Peterson.

32:30 - discussion on why a [[workers' party]] hasn't formed. 

35:30 - discussion on working within the DNC. Sunkara says that socialists running as Democrats has "made socialism relevenant to millions." I think the crisis of capitalism has largely done that, but he's right that these figures have helped to popularize this. I think Sunkara is wrong in saying that socialists can maintain class independence while running as Democrats. By running within a capitalist party, we are implicitly admitting that we don't have the strength, and that the working class doesn't have the strength to win power alone. This mindset is a huge brake on the movement. 

37:45 - Peterson makes the excellent point that in a revolutionary situation, both the Republicans and the Democrats would be absolutely blown apart by public hatred. Any socialists that run as Democrats, even if they are successful, and even if they somehow maintain their oppositional stance in the face of massive pressure, without a party behind them to hold them accountable, the workers will most likely abandon them because of their participation inside the Democrats. 

41:00 - what is the immediate goal of the socialist movement, and what are the roles of your publications within them? Sunkara says our immediate goal must be to create an "infrastructure of dissent" so that the working class can begin to fight back against the bosses. Sunkara says that Jacobin has succeded in bringing class into the picture.
 
Peterson highlights the power of the working class and the trade [[unions]], even in their decimated state. He says that the only problem is the leadership of the class. He says that our goal should be a world socialist federation and that we need to define our long term goals. He also says that when the next crisis occurs, the changes in [[class consciousness]] will be dramatic and the mood will really change. 

I would say he was right! This was taped in 2019, and a year later we had [[June 2020 uprising]]. 

Peterson also counters the idea of [[reformism]] in our current era since we can see that all across the world, austerity is the name of the game. [[capitalism]] in a decline cannot provide reforms. 

56:00 - Sunkara says that Peterson over-emphasizes the union bureaucracy being a brake on the movement. He also says that the strategy of preparing for consciousness to change "isn't a political strategy." He says this because he thinks that we have to orient to current conditions, not future ones. 

58:00 - Sunkara actually says that workers need their bosses more than vice versa. How is he a socialist then? To be fair, he's just trying to make a point about how during crisis workers are hesitant to strike. He also goes on to say that workers are following their class interest when they vote for [[Democratic Party]]. 

1:20:00 - a very bad question haha. A guy who calls himself a "liberal socialist" lmao. 

There are a lot of bad questions! Is this really the political level of a DSA meeting???

1:26:20 - Sunkara thinks that we need to break with the Democrats *eventually,* and says that we can get there gradually through the formation of an independent caucus that makes use of any ballot line they want, including the Democrats.
