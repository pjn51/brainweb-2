Engels notes the "bourgeois tradition" of having a two-party system in England in the late 1800s. [1]

Engels says that since religion and culture spring from economic foundations, the old manifestations of the former cannot survive a revolution in the latter. [1]

Engels explains the early steps of the English working class, saying that while they mistrusted the name of "socialsm," they were still absorbing its essence. [2]

Engels says that the workers' movement in [[Germany]] is "within measurable distance of success." [2] Well, this aged like milk!
