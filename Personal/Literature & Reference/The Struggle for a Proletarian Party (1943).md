- [[Cannon pursued a high-road strategy against Shachtman's bloc]]
- [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]]
- [[The petty bourgeoisie prefers endless debate]]
- [[The party is a combat organization]]
- [[Neutrality is impossible]]

Interestingly, [[Cannon cites the Holodomor as a crime of Stalinism]] (p.29).

Cannon notes that it is possible for members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] to come over to the side of the workers, as [[Lenin]], [[Trotsky]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] did. However, he says that it was necessary for these people to firmly desert their former class, and he says this is unlike the petty bourgeois intellectuals in the SWP at the time of the split (p.45). This was a time when [[Crisis reveals petty bourgeois elements within the workers' movement]]. It's also a good point that [[Revolutionaries come from all classes]]. 

Cannon argues that most American left-wing intellectuals have been no help to the movement, apart from the shining example of De Leon, who Cannon says was a genuine revolutionary who decisively cut ties with the academic establishment (p.47). 

The author criticizes the prewar Social Democratic establishment for not acting urgently enough, and believing there was unlimited time for gradual movement towards socialism. He argues that a symptom of this was the lack of full-time leaders, saying that most leaders of the parties were lawyers or doctors who spent evenings and weekends working in the party (p.50).
