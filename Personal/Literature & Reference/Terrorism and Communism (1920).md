# Summary
In this book, written during the Russian civil war, [[Trotsky]] defends the fact that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]]. [[Kautsky]] had written a pamphlet slandering the [[Bolsheviks]] as an evil, "anti-democratic" force.

Throughout the book, Trotsky uses the Paris Commune as an allegory for a revolutionary situation under seige, and argues that the Communists are doing what the Parisian Communards ought to have done to avoid a slaughter. He also discusses the details of the militarization of labor, and the use of military detachments for other economic tasks. 

The introduction is written by [[Zizek]].

# On the "dictatorship" of the party
Trotsky says that [[Leadership develops organically]], and the [[proletariat|working class]] is no different. He characterized the Communist Party as the organic leadership of the working class, made up of the most class-conscious and determined workers (p 105).

# On the suppression of other parties
Trotsky argues that if the [[Mensheviks]] and [[Socialist Revolutionaries|SRs]] were really representative of a section of the working class, as Kautsky claims, then their suppression wouldn't really be possible. He points out that where the Whites suppress the Reds, the Reds still gain underground support, but the Whites' organizations tend to disintegrate (p 105). 

# On the peasantry
Trotsky defends the [[Russia|Soviet]] policy towards the peasantry from Kautsky, who says that the Communists wavered between denying the peasants political rights and then granting them.

Trotsky says that it was necessary to divide the poor peasants against the rich [[kulak]], and says this is the explanation for the Committees of the Poor that were created. He says that after the suppression of the kulaks was accomplished, and the wavering middle layer of the peasants began to side with the proletariat against their class enemies, these Committees could be replaced with local soviets where more peasants could be represented. 

# On Soviet economic policy
Just as a strike causes the workers to consume without producing, Trotsky remarks, so does a social revolution and revolutionary civil war cause economic crisis on a much larger scale. To him, this absolves "socialist economic methods" of any blame related to the Russian economy of the 1910s and 20s. 

[[During the Russian Civil War, Trotsky justified compulsory labor]], and called for the "militarization of labor."

# On Kautsky
Trotsky says that Kautsky represents the founder of the "Austro-Marxist" school, which is a corruption of the revolutionary nature of Marxism and represents a passive rather than active philosophy (165).
