# Is Housework An Unpaid Job? False Theoretical Premise Leads to Reactionary Position in Practice


---
*This is an article put out by the Spanish section of the IMT, in response to [[Wages Against Housework (1975)]]*

We must examine the question of wages for housework from two perspectives, an economic one where we consider the [[labor theory of value]], and a political one where we consider the tactical question and the interest of the working class and the way to really overcome the oppression of women. 

Marxists aren't [[moralism|moralists]]. No amount of moralizing about how housewives deserve wages will really achieve their liberation if we misunderstand the basic laws of capitalism. Therefore, we must start with a scientific economic analysis.

## What are Wages?
*[[labor]] power* is the collection of physical and intellectual abilities that allow a worker to perform labor and thus generate value. The value of labor power is expressed in wages that are paid to the worker. This value is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time needed to produce it. 

This includes the need to both keep the worker alive, and to keep a family alive to allow for social reproduction of the working class. 

## [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] on Wages and Domestic Labor
Marx and Engels are both clear that their position is that wages cover both the subsistence of the worker, and of the workers' family. In this way, [[capitalism]] ensures the continuation of the whole system generation after generation.

Therefore, the real oppression here is not the unpaid wage, since the wages for domestic work are implicit in the wages given to the husband. The real injustice here is the domestic slavery that the husband subjects upon the wife. 

## Are Capitalists Such Obliging People?
From another angle, how does the housewife survive if no wage is paid to her? Where does she get any [[currency|money]] from? The obvious answer is from her husband's wage. But if the husband's wage only contains enough for his own survival, how can the whole family survive on it? There's really no way around accepting that from an economic standpoint, the wages for housework are already included in the husband's wage. 

## The Deprication of the Family Wage
The wage is set based on the *average* necessary cost to reproduce the laborer. Therefore, as more and more women enter the workforce, the average cost to reproduce the laborer goes down. This is because more and more workers only have to support themselves out of their wage. This trend is accelerated by declining birthrates as well. 

This increase in womens' income is offset by an increased need to purchase services that replace the labor of the housewife. Therefore, no real gain is made in terms of standard of living when women enter the workforce. 

## Are Children an "Exchange Value" Produced by the Housewife?
Some claim that housewives produce laborers as [[commodities]], and sell them to the capitalist. This is another misunderstanding. Capitalists do not purchase their laborers from anyone, but purchase labor-power from the workers themselves. The children that a mother raises are not commodities, because they are not created for the purpose of exchange. 

The housewife labors to increase use value, not exchange value. 

## Reproductive Labor or Domestic Slavery?
The position of the housewife is similar to that of the domestic slave in ancient [[Rome]]. 

Payment for the wife's labor would not only fail to raise her standard of living, but it would also perpetuate the idea of the wife as a beast of burden. It would keep her in the home, isolated from society and easier to manipulate. 

For their credit, most left currents within the [[feminism]] of the 70s rejected this idea. Fundamentally, those like [[Federici]] have a perspective of total failure to achieve liberation. 

> In the 1970s, when strategic decisions had to be made in the [[USA|United States]] as well as in Europe, the feminist movement completely abandoned the reproductive field and almost exclusively focused on work outside the home. The objective was to win equality through labour. However, men were disgruntled in the workplace, and achieving equality just to be equally as disgruntled and oppressed as them is no strategy at all.

Having failed to achieve liberation through the workers' movement, Federici proposes retreating into the home, but with a wage as consolation prize. 

The only *real* solution is to link the fight to end womens' oppression with the fight for [[socialism]]. However, that isn't Federici's perspective. 

## Waged Labor in the Home
The nature of so-called care work is different from the housewife's work. By being organized into a firm, with other workers, and working in multiple homes, the care worker becomes more connected with the working class and society generally. This creates more bonds of solidarity. 

Under socialism, we could expand these care industries to absorb all of the work that falls to the housewife. This would not only free the housewife immediately, but it would break down the capitalist expression of the family unit over time, and socialize that unit. 

## For a Socialist Alternative to Domestic Slavery
We can follow the development of capitalism in terms of the introduction of women to the workforce, and to the outsourcing of domestic labor to waged workers, and follow this line towards a future in which socialist economic organization allows for the fufillment of these trends. 

It is utopian to attempt to invent new economic trends out of thin air, or attempt to impose a certain unnatural plan of development upon the world. 

With that in mind, the call for housewives to recieve individual wages, which we know would be deducted from the husband's paycheck, is downright reactionary. Totally unrevolutionary. 

The truly revolutionary demand is to demand free public services that can ease the burden of the housewife, allowing her to take her rightful place alongside her husband as a member of the working class. Linked with a transitional program moving society towards socialism, this is the most direct route to true liberation for women.
