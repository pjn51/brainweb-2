# A letter to James P. Cannon (September 1939)
In a letter to the American [[James Cannon]], Trotsky explains his thoughts on the debate over the nature of the [[Russia|USSR]]. In his view, there was no reason to say that the pact between [[Germany]] and the Soviets fundamentally changed the character of the latter. If that was the case, he says, then we would be prisoners of the "Stalinist conception of the People's Front epoch."

Trotsky adds that anyone who says the USSR is no longer a degenerated workers' state should clearly state how this changes our political conclusions on the matter.     

Trotsky explains his thoughts on the new idea that "bureaucratic collectivism" was a new social formation replacing [[capitalism]]. If that were the case, then the proponent of such an idea is writing off the revolutionary potential of the entire world [[proletariat]] and the entire movement for [[socialism]]. 

> [!question]
> I'm not sure I follow Trotsky here. Couldn't bureaucratic collectivism be a stage in between capitalism and socialism that develops under terrible material circumstances? We've seen that this state of affairs was just transitory wherever it appeared, but how did Trotsky make the above argument? Couldn't an honest socialist argue that backwards countries proceed through a bureaucratic collectivist stage before socialism is possible?

Trotsky finishes by noting the significance of that position. This would be an "adventuristic jump" that stands in "aboslute contradiction" to the tactics and programs of the workers' movement. 

# The USSR in war (September 1939)
## The German Soviet pact and the character of the USSR
Trotsky explains the relationship between the idealized form of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]] and the historical fact of the degeneration of the USSR. Far from abandoning the idea that is not in accord with reality, we should see that the degeneration of the USSR away from the norms of a healthy workers' state demonstrates what we're fighting for. We should understand that the contradiction between ideal and reality here doesn't mean that we should abandon the ideal, but that we should examine the elements of the workers' state that are worth salvaging and developing towards the ideal. 

Trotsky turns to the German-Soviet pact directly. The fact is that the Soviet bureaucracy has such contempt for the international proletariat that they would sign a pact with [[Hitler]]. However, this does not change the social character of the USSR. It is just a "gauge with which to measure the degree of degeneration of the Soviet bureaucracy." Those who think that the betrayal of bourgeois democracy means the absence of a workers' state misunderstand that a workers' state is not the *ally* of bourgeois democracy, but *its enemy.*

## Are the differences political or terminological?
Trotsky asks what tactical differences flow from a difference in assessment of the USSR. The [[Fourth International]] had already established the need to overthrown the Soviet bureaucracy, and to re-establish workers' democracy in the USSR. Those who said the USSR was no longer a degenerated workers' [[state]] had no new ideas on the concrete front. Since it would be the task of a renewed USSR to coordinate with the world revolution, the overthrow of the bureaucracy in the USSR therefore presupposes the retention of state property and the [[economic planning|planned economy]]. 

Trotsky discusses the difference between a *political* revolution and a *social* one (6). Since the "parisitic oligarchy" of the Soviet Union must be overthrown, Trotsky calls for a *political* revolution in the USSR. Others were calling for a *social* revolution, but they didn't really add any new tasks for such a revolution beyond Trotsky's analysis. Instead, they just demanded that we call the bureaucrats a ruling class, and refused to call the USSR a degenerated workers' state. 

> Were we to make them these terminological concessions, we would place our critics in a very difficult position, inasmuch as they themselves would not know what to do with their purely verbal victory.

## Let us check ourselves once again
Trotsky clarifies that it would be silly to split with those who suffer from these terminological issues, but says that just as a house should be kept clean of dust lest it develop further, we should keep the revolutionary party clean of misconceptions, no matter how small. 

> Just as a tidy housewife never permits an accumulation of cobwebs and garbage, just so a revolutionary party cannot tolerate lack of clarity, confusion and equivocation. Our house must be kept clean!

Trotsky recalls previous clarifications. They had stated the Thermidor was still ascending but not yet "consummated," and later realized that this consummation had already happened. They rectified this mistake openly, and there wasn't any drama because everyone agreed on the larger trajectory of the USSR, and this mistake was just a matter of progression along an agreed-upon path. Trotsky hopes that a similar rectification could occur over the question of the defense of the USSR. 

## Is it a cancerous growth or a new organ?
Trotsky turns to the question of if the Soviet bureaucracy is a "class" or not. Those who replied in the affirmative would say that the bureaucracy didn't resemble either the bourgeois or labor bureaucracies, and represented a totally new social formation. 

Trotsky agreed, but said that if we label this group as a class, we will have gained little, since the bureaucrats don't resemble any of the propertied classes from history. 

Instead, Trotsky proposes the use of "caste" as a makeshift definition. This term emphasizes the "shut in character, arbitrary rule, and haughtiness" of the group. It also emphasizes that this isn't a final word on the topic, since this is a group still in its early evolution. Trotsky says that referring to them as a "bureaucracy" should suffice for now. 

Trotsky elevates this terminological question to the political plane. The real question is if the bureaucracy represents a cancerous growth on the social organism, or if it has been transformed into a "historically indispensible" organ of the organism itself. 

Trotsky explains that social organs can only develop based on the needs of production itself, while "social excresences" can be formed based on historical circumstances.

> [!question]
> What "need of production" did the feudal aristocracy serve? They seemed to be just as parasitic as the bureaucracy.

## The early degeneration of the bureaucracy
Trotsky discusses the effect of the bureaucracy on the Soviet economy. The historical justification of each ruling class was that under its rule, the level of economic development increased. While the Soviet economy did expand under the control of the bureaucracy, this was because of the nationalization of the means of production and the adoption of the methods and technology of the USSR's more advanced neighbors. This development was only *hindered* by the role of the bureaucracy. 

> [!question]
> Couldn't you also say that the capitalist class hindered economic growth in the same way?
> 
> A: No, not really. The capitalists allocated capital more efficiently than their predecessors, so they really did play a more progressive role. 
> 
> Q: But didn't the bureaucrats also allocate resources more efficiently than their Tsarist and capitalist predecessors?

Trotsky provides a grim forecast for the USSR. As the economy becomes more and more complicated, the bureaucracy will find it harder and harder to provide development while maintaining control over it. 

From this, Trotsky draws the conclusion that the bureaucracy is not a bearer of a new system, and is merely a parasitic growth of a workers' state. Since this contradiction between growth and bureaucratic control is so sharp, it will create political turmoil before the bureaucracy can exude a ruling class from itself. 

## The conditions for the omnipotence and fall of the bureaucracy
Trotsky discusses the conditions that require bureaucracy. In a situation of scarce goods, a policeman is needed who eventually grows to control the system of distribution. Hostile external pressure also gives this policeman the role of national defender, further extending their authority and ability to siphon resources. 

Because the main reasons for bureaucracy (economic backwardness and external agression) would fall away in the case of a world revolution, Trotsky predicts that the bureaucracy would have no home in such a world. The role of societal policeman would be obsolete and there would be no room for a ruling class or exploiting caste. 

## And what if the socialist revolution is not accomplished?
Trotsky explains a common argument that is heard by so-called "leftists." They say that the global proletariat has time and again proved to be incapable of running society. They failed to stop [[WW1]], they failed to restrict the Soviet bureaucracy, to stop [[fascism]], to stop [[WW2]], and to save the revolution in [[Spain]]. Trotsky says that to some, this indicates that only another bureaucracy is capable of supplanting the bourgeoisie, and that eventually we will see a Soviet-style bureaucracy over the whole world. 

## The present war and the fate of modern society
Trotsky says that the soundness of the above theory is being posed concretely in the present (1939). He "firmly believes" that WW2 would spark a socialist revolution, and that this would demonstrate the transitory nature of the Soviet bureaucracy to the world. 

However, Trotsky admits that a revolutionary end to WW2 is not a given. He sees another possibility, the further decay of monopoly capitalism, the continued fusion of the state with the capitalist class, and the possible development of a regime of [[Bonapartism]] replacing bourgeois democracy worldwide. 

Trotsky expects this to coincide with the victory of fascism, which is an interesting error. Instead, it seems that the capitalist class still had a bit more juice in it, and the wholesale destruction of Europe helped rejuvenate global capitalism for a time. 

Trotsky explains that if a third result happened, where the proletariat of the advanced countries succeded in taking power, but were compelled to surrender it to a bureaucracy, we would have to concede that the theory of "bureaucratic collectivism" held some water, and represented a new state of affairs. 

Trotsky says that the essential question remains: is the Stalinist regime a relapse in the progress of society, or does it represent a new stage for the economic development of humanity? If the latter is true, then we would have to admit that the theories of the development of socialism out of capitalism were utopian, and we would have to reformulate our theories of social development. 

## The theory of "bureaucratic collectivism"
Trotsky introduces us to a few proponents of new theories of social development. In [[Germany]] shortly after the rise of [[Hitler]], Hugo Urbahns (a left-communist) concluded that a new stage of "state capitalism" was incoming. He posed that [[Italy]], the USSR, and Germany were the first examples of this. Later, in Italy, Bruno R. elaborated on this theory. Bruno said that "bureaucratic collectivism" was a more precise definition of this new stage. He defined this new bureaucracy as a class, and said that proletarians were becoming slaves under this regime. 

Trotsky expands on Bruno R's theory. Bruno said that the USSR's [[economic planning|planned economy]], fascism, National Socialism, and the New Deal in the [[USA]] shared common features. In Trotsky's analysis, this is true, however their common features were due to the economic effects of monopoly capitalism, described by [[Lenin]] in [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]]. 

Trotsky credits Bruno with discerning that due to the political submission of the working class, this economic concentration presents itself as "bureaucratic collectivism." But Trotsky asserts that this is a "deformity of a transitional period," while Bruno says it's a new social formation. 

Turning to the identification of Stalinism and Fascism, Trotsky further critiques Bruno. Bruno says these phenomena are essentially the same, and that eventually the fascists will expropriate the bourgeoisie and complete the identification of the two. Trotsky agrees that the Stalinists have been compelled to adopt fascistic political technique, but says that there's no way that the fascists will exproporiate the ruling class. 

> “Partial” measures of state intervention and of nationalization in reality differ from planned state economy just as reforms differ from revolution. Mussolini and Hitler are only “coordinating” the interests of the property owners and “regulating” capitalist economy, and, moreover, primarily for war purposes.

Trotsky asserts that the Soviet bureaucracy is a different beast. It actually directs the whole of the Soviet economy, because of the courage of the Russian workers in overturning capitalist property relations. 

Even if we agree that fascism and Stalinism are heading to the same state of bureaucratic collectivism, Trotsky continues, this is no solution of capitalism's issues. Bureaucratic collectivism may partially solve the issue of private property, but it doesn't address the negative role of the nation-state. A world of fascist states would actually increase the damage done by imperialist wars, destroying the progress gained by planned economy. 

Trotsky argues that even if one fascist state succeeded in dominating the whole earth, this would only intensify the national liberation movements throughout its territory, making this situation incredibly unstable. 

## Proletariat and its leadership
Trotsky turns to a brief discussion of the relationship between the classes and their leaderships. He expands upon this in a separate article ([[The Class, the Party, and the Leadership (1940)]]). Leaders of the working class, having risen above the others, naturally succumb to pressures from the ruling class. 

Turning to an American example, Trotsky says that because of this principle, the leadership of the [[unions]] in the [[USA]] reflects the [[bourgeoisie]] more than the [[proletariat]]. The extent to which this process degrades the leadership is dependent on historical circumstances, evidenced by the fact that Russia, with its weak working class, had a superior leadership in 1917 than the working class of the most ancient capitalist state, the [[UK]], did. This contrast reflects the [[dialectics]] of history. 

Trotsky poses the central question of leadership:

> Will objective historical necessity in the long run cut a path for itself in the consciousness of the vanguard of the working class; that is, in the process of this war and those profound shocks which it must engender will a genuine revolutionary leadership be formed capable of leading the proletariat to the conquest of power?

The existance of the [[Fourth International]], Trotsky says, means that some answer this question in the affirmative. Disillusioned pseudo-Marxists proceed from a negative answer to this question, and see the impotent leadership of the workers as direct evidence of the impotence of the working class as a whole. 

Trotsky examines the results of this pessimistic line of thinking. If the defeat of the working class lies in its own social characteristics, the battle for socialism is lost. The working class will not increase in size, nor in cultural level under a decaying capitalist regime. The situation becomes much more clear if we can clarify the contradiction between the desire to overthrow capitalism that the workers feel, and the pathetic, bourgeois nature of their leaders. 

## Totalitarian dictatorship - a condition of acute crisis and not a stable regime
Trotsky re-asserts the validity of the Marxist forecast. The October revolution was predicted in advance, and this prediction was confirmed by events. The degeneration of the revolution does not contradict the predictions of Marxism, although more work should have been done to differentiate between an external wrecking of the Soviet state and internal degeneration. 

However, Trotsky explains that wrecking from the outside and degeneration within must ultimately coincide. That is, degeneration will inevitably lead to downfall of the whole state. 

The author examines the need for the totalitarian techniques of Stalinism and fascism. Both stem from a temporary state of affairs, where stability has been eroded to the point that only naked agression can maintain the status quo. 

Trotsky critiques Bruno R. for seeing the purges rippling through the Soviet bureaucracy as evidence that this group is a new ruling class. To the contrary, this reflects the unstable position of the bureaucrats. 

## The orientation towards world revolution and the regeneration of the USSR
Trotsky begins by saying that the fundamental task of humanity has not been solved. 25 years proved to be too long for the Soviet system to hold out in an isolated country, but too short of a time to re-arm the world proletariat. However, we should see the October revolution as a theoretical asset, since it was a concrete demonstration of how humanity's tasks may be solved in practice. 

Continuing, Trotsky says that humanity is paying for this delayed solution with another imperialist war. If the world socialist revolution fails, against all odds, to resume in one of the more developed capitalist countries, Trotsky says we ought to revise our formulation of what the fundamental trajectory of this era was. He poses the question: is this the epoch of world social revolution, or the epoch of totalitarian bureaucracy?

> [!question]
> It seems that it was the era of neither of these perspectives, assuming that Trotsky means "bureaucratic centralism" as the alternative to socialist society. We saw a resurgence in the viability of capitalism in some countries, and even the reaching of new heights in the [[USA]]. What can we make of this?

Trotsky says that thinkers like Bruno R. and Hugo Urbahns have two errors. They proclaim that bureaucratic centralism is already a decided victor, and declare that this represents a new, stable stage of human history between capitalism and socialism. Twenty five years are a blink of an eye in the timescale of class struggle, and we have no right to resign ourselves to the final defeat of socialism, which the success of bureaucratic collectivism would indicate. 

> [!question]
> It's now been over 100 years since 1917. That's not a blink of an eye. At what point would we have to declare defeat, and what can explain the unexpected longevity of capitalism?

## Foreign policy is the continuation of domestic policy
Trotsky clarifies the things that are worth defending about the USSR - state property in the means of production. The Stalinist bureaucracy represents a privatizing force in the long run, and are not interested in preserving the gains of the October revolution. 

Trotksy criticizes Bruno R's assessment of the alliance of Hitler and Stalin as fundamentally stable. In Trotsky's view, Hitler and the Nazis are commited to preserving the German bourgeoisie, while there is no longer a dominant bourgeoisie in the USSR. This means that Hitler would inevitably betray Stalin, and turn the German guns on the USSR. 

## The defense of the USSR and the class struggle
Trotsky argues that some mistakenly think that defense of the USSR means a friendly relationship with the Soviet bureaucracy, or friendliness towards the USSR's allies. 

The author turns to the publication *Que Faire.* This periodical said that the "Trotskyites" were defeatists in regard to [[France]] and the [[UK]], and were therefore defeatitst towards the USSR. To renounce defeatism towards the imperialist countries, Trotsky argues, is to push the workers of these countries towards their ruling classes, and amounts to renouncing defeatism in general. This is, to Trotsky, tantamount to betrayal of the socialist revolution worldwide. 

Trotksy thinks that the Cominern covers their renunciation of [[class independence]] with a shroud of "defense of the USSR." He elaborates that this strategy turns the working class into "an auxillary force of one bourgeois camp against another." But on the other hand, Trotsky also criticizes those who refuse to support the USSR at all, out of fear that they will be pawns of Stalin. Instead, Trotsky says we should defend the USSR just as we would defend a colony in a struggle against imperialism - through the method of *international class struggle.*

Trotsky grounds this analysis in the objective situation of his group. He says that his allies are not a governing party, and can therefore only hope to influence events through the education of the masses, agitation, and through careful explanation - not through bourgeois states or even the USSR's government. 

## The question of occupied territories
Trotsky turns to the question of what the USSR would do with the occupied territories it had gained. He says that Stalin had promised the Germans that the Soviets would resepect private property in occupied regions, and he says that if this actually happens, it could be the starting point for a qualitative shift in the policy of the bureaucracy.

On the other hand, Trotsky continues, the USSR may expropriate the large landowners and seize the means of production. He says this is more likely since the bureaucracy won't want to share power with the old ruling classes that the Red Army will encounter in these places. 

Trotsky cites a historical analogy - Napoleon's invasion of Poland. When Napoleon invaded, Trotsky recounts, he abolished serfdom. He did this not out of love for the peasantry, but because the Napoleonic dictatorship was based on bourgeois, and not feudal, property relations. Since the Stalinist clique, Trotsky analyzes, is not based on bourgeois property relations, it will have no interest in preserving them wherever it finds them. 

Trotsky thinks that while the expropriation of the ruling classes in the occupied territories must involve mass activity on some level, this is likely to be carefully watched and supervised by the Moscow bureaucracy. If need be, Trotsky notes, they may use repression to make sure it stays within limits. 

Trotsky argues that the invasion of capitalist countries by the USSR isn't a revolutionary policy, even though the capitalists are expropriated. He says that the primary "political criterion" for the communists is not the transformation of property relations in one area or another, but the elevation of the consciousness and organization of the working class as a whole. From this perspective, he argues, the bureaucratic invasion from outside of Poland is not advancing the cause of the international proletariat whatsoever. 

However, Trotsky admits that the expropriation of the Polish bourgeoisie is probably a positive in this situation. He says that if the Nazis invaded and tried to restore private property, the workers would rally to the Red Army and defend their gains. 

## We do not change our course!
Trotsky explains that the current program centering the need to overthrow the Soviet bureaucracy is still valid in the face of these new events. He says that the "statification" of the economy is a good thing, but it's relative importance depends on what other effects the events have. He says that the increase in prestige and legitimacy that this conquest has brought the Stalinist bureaucracy is really bad, and outweighs the good that the planned economy brings. 

Trotsky says that if nationalized property in Poland is used for the good of the working class, the bureaucracy must be overthrown. He argues that this isn't affected by the linguistic arguments about whether or not the USSR is a workers' state or not. 

Trotsky advocates for the independence of a Soviet [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], and says that the Fourth International opposes any new territorial gains by the Kremlin. At the same time, he says that partisans of the Fourth International should help the Red Army in Poland to expropriate the capitalists and landlords by creating Soviets and Workers' Committees. He encourages these partisans to retain political independence, and run against the Stalinist candidates for all positions, while fighting for influence against that faction anywhere they can. 

Trotksy discusses the proper course of action if Germany was to attack the USSR. He says that the most urgent task would be defense against Hitler, but that the political line of the Fourth International shouldn't change in regards to the Kremlin at all. He says that the message to the workers should be that Stalin cannot be trusted to defeat fascism, the workers must do it themselves. 

## Conclusions
Trotsky asserts the continued validity of his position on the USSR. He says that war accelerates the political processes at work in the USSR, so it is critical to follow the events inside the Soviet Union closely to see if the war is resulting in a revolutionary *re*generation or *de*generation of the country. 

Trotsky urges the Fourth International to develop slogans skillfully. He says that they should allow the workers to clearly see what they defend in the USSR and what they are attacking. He says that the task of preserving state property is more important than defeating the bureaucracy, but that the question of world revolution is more important than any other goal. 

# A letter to Sherman Stanley
Trotsky begins this letter by saying that he was inclined to write it because of Sherman's contradictory statements lately. 

Trotsky says that Sherman's position is that due to some disagreements within the Party, a disaster is approaching. He criticizes this position, saying that "even if there had been two *irreconcilable* positions, it would signify not a disaster but a necessity to fight out the political struggle to the end." 

Trotsky also criticizes Sherman's veiled accusations of uncomradely behavior towards other members of the Party, saying that Sherman shouldn't make those kinds of accusations lightly. 

Continuing, Trotsky defends his article, *The USSR in War*, against criticisms by Sherman, particularly on the territorial expansion of the USSR. Trotsky says that the opponents of the Bolsheviks had compared the expansion of the USSR with that of Czarist empire, but this is incorrect. Naturally, he says, even a healthy workers' state would expand, and that expansion would look quite similar to that of a capitalist empire. To Trotsky, this is because "revolutions don't ordinarily change geographical conditions." He argues that we must support the USSR against counter-attack, while also calling for the overthrow of the bureaucracy. 

> [!question]
> What is the historical context of this letter? Who is Sherman Stanley?

# Again and once more again on the nature of the USSR
## Psychoanalysis and Marxism
Trotsky begins by defending himself against accusations that he is psychologically unable to accept that the USSR is no longer a workers' state. He says that those who define the bureaucracy as a new class are engaging in "terminological terrorism" because of their desire to destroy the bureaucracy without the ability to do so.

Trotsky compares the USSR to a machine weilded by gangsters. He says that when repairing this machine, a good mechanic, overcoming disgust as to what the gangsters have used this machine for, will set to work determining which parts are still in good order, and which parts must be scrapped entirely and made anew. He says that a class conscious worker will have the same attitude towards the USSR, despite the horrible purposes the bureaucrats have used the state machinery for. 

> [!note]
> It's notable that Trotsky argues so strongly that the state machinery of the USSR can still be salvaged by the workers. Lenin makes the opposite argument in [[The State and Revolution (1917)]], arguing that the workers must completely scrap the bourgeois state. This shows why understanding the difference between a workers' state and a bourgeois state is so critical.

## "A counter-revolutionary workers' state"
Trotsky defends the idea of calling the USSR a "counter-revolutionary workers' state," saying that this formulation seems counter-intuitive only when you forget that there have been counter-revolutionary [[unions]] and workers' internationals, like the [[Second International]]. He says that with these organizations, it is common sense that we would push them farther while defending them against the bourgeoisie, and Trotsky calls on us to have the same attitude towards the USSR. 

> In the last analysis, a workers' state is a trade union which has conqured power. 

## Imperialism?
Trotsky asks if the present expansion can be called imperialism. He argues that yes, but only in the broadest sense of the term. In the Marxist usage, he says, the Kremlin is not conducting imperialism, and to argue that it is the same is reflective of a petty-bourgeois democratic bent. 

## Continuation of the policy of Czarist imperialism
Trotsky asserts that we cannot say the USSR is continuing the policy of Czarist imperialism just because this appears to be the case when we look at what territory the Soviet Union is trying to occupy. To Trotsky, revolutions don't change geographic conditions, so it's perfectly natural that the USSR is interested in the same areas that the Tsar was interested in. 

## Agency of imperialism?
Trotsky reminds us that even a healthy workers' state might have to make temporary agreements with this or that imperialist nation, since it couldn't break away from the international world all at once. He says that in light of this, the Brest-Litovsk peace  *did* aid [[Germany|German]] imperialism, but that doesn't reflect a failure on principle, since it was a choice between peace and the destruction of the workers' state. 

However, Trotsky sees the division of [[Poland]] differently. He says that the USSR was not choosing between death and the division. Trotsky argues that the bureaucrats just sacrificed half of Poland to the [[Nazi Party]] for no real gain. Therefore, Trotsky calls the bureaucrats *agents* of imperialism, while the USSR is not an imperialist state itself. 

> If we want to define the foreign policy of the Kremlin exactly, we must say that it is the policy, of the _Bonapartist bureaucracy of a degenerated workers’ state in imperialist encirclement_. This definition is not as short or as sonorous as “imperialist policy,” but in return it is more precise.

## "The lesser evil"
> If somebody sets, or helps to set a house on fire and afterward saves five out of ten of the occupants of the house in order to convert them into his own semi-slaves, that is to be sure a lesser evil than to have burned the entire ten. But it is dubious that this firebug merits a medal for the rescue.

## "Armed missionaries"
Trotsky differentiates between the imposition of revolutionary ideas on people who aren't ready for them, and the military intervention of a workers' state into an ongoing revolutionary situation. He says that the former is never a good idea, while the latter might sometimes be valuable, as long as that decision would be popular among the workers of the country in which the military intervention is happening. 

Trotsky criticizes the Kremlin for failing to take the feelings and desires of the proletariat into account when deciding on interventions and foreign policy. Because of this, he remarks, the Kremlin has "introduced extreme confusion into the ranks of the world proletariat."

## Insurrection on two fronts
Trotsky says that the ideal situation would be the eruption of revolution in Germany, Poland, and the USSR simultaneously. However, he thinks this is unlikely. If [[Hitler]] attacks the USSR before the German workers rise up, Trotsky advises the [[Fourth International]] to advocate for the defense of the USSR agains the Nazis, at the same time that they criticize Stalin and the Kremlin. 

## "Unconditional defense of the USSR"
Trotsky offers 'unconditional' defense of the USSR, meaning that he doesn't lay any conditions on the bureaucracy, since he supports the USSR for its social basis, not for its leadership. He says that we should support the characteristics of the USSR which make it a workers' state, and not those which are a feature of its degeneracy. 

Posing a hypothetical, Trotsky says that if the USSR invaded [[India]] and began to suppress a revolutionary movement there, we ought to support the revolutionary movement, even if the defeat of the Red Army temporarily weakens the USSR. He notes that the defeat of the global workers' movement is much more dangerous for the social basis of the USSR than the defeat of the Red Army is. 

> A trade union led by reactionary fakers organizes a strike against the admission of Negro workers into a certain branch of industry. Shall we support such a shameful strike? Of course not. But let us imagine that the bosses, utilizing the given strike, make an attempt to crush the trade union and to make impossible in general the organized self-defense of the workers. In this case we will defend the trade union as a matter of course in spite of its reactionary leadership. Why is not this same policy applicable to the USSR?

## The fundamental rule
Trotsky formulates the basic course of action: all workers should seek to seize power in their own countries, regardless of their state's relationship to the USSR. At the same time, he adds that workers should seek to defend the USSR if possible, through strike action or sabotage of their state's ability to strike at the Soviet Union. 

## "Revision of Marxism?"
Trotsky says that some were surprised that he admitted the possibility of bureaucractic collectivism arising. He says that these critics have mistaken the historical necessity of [[socialism]] with some sort of Marxist fatalism or inevitability. He says that we must be frank about what would happen if the forces of reaction defeat the proletariat. 

Trotsky says that the progression from capitalism to socialism is more complicated than [[Marx]] predicted, with detours to [[fascism]] evidently possible. He affirms that this is *not* a revision of Marx, but an elaboration on events that Marx didn't witness. In fact, Trotsky accuses those who see a new kind of non-bourgeois and non-proletarian state on the horizon of being the real revisionists. 

## The right of revolutionary optimism
Trotsky relays the account of a conversation between Hitler and the French ambassador, where they discuss the fact that both understand that a new war would increase the risk of revolution. Trotsky says that this open admittal of the danger should give us optimism. 

> [!question]
> Why did WW2 fail to spark revolution?

# The referendum and democratic centralism (October 1939)
The footnotes reveal that in October 1939, the minority put forward the demand for a referendum on the USSR. The majority, we are told, opposed this decision, as did Trotsky, who wrote this letter to clarify his opposition to a referendum. 

In this letter, Trotsky comes out against the idea that all questions can be settled by referendum within the revolutionary organization. He says that if the party were to do this, it would be replacing the guidance of the most experienced and knowlegeable comrades with the guidance of the average member, and instead, the party locals ought to send delegates to a national convention where an open discussion and debate can be held, allowing the delegates to change their minds if arguments sway them. By doing this, Trotsky says, we can ensure that the party remains "a centralized whole" that is able to make decisions based on the total experience and understanding of all of the best members working together to debate and argue towards a solution to each problem. 

# A letter to Sherman Stanley (October 1939)
Trotsky begins by criticizing Stanley for Stanley's claim that "there can be no serious differences or disagreements [on the Russian question]." Trotsky says that there evidently is disagreement, since there is a debate raging about supporting the USSR on the verge of [[WW2]]. 

Trotsky continues to say that Stanley is incorrect in saying that Trotsky and [[Shachtman]]'s statements are non-contradictory on the USSR. He says that on the question of the class nature of the USSR, Shachtman is unsure, and wishes to reject the current conception and answer the question later. On the seccond question, the question of the defense of the USSR, Trotsky explains that Shachtman's idea of a abstract revolution against Hitler *and* Stalin is insufficiently concrete. 

Trotsky goes on to attack Stanley's attempt to avoid being pinned down in his arguments, saying that Stanley's attempt to say that the "internal regime" is the real issue, not any specific position. Trotsky argues that this is the same formulation that many others have historically used to get out of a lost argument. 

> [!question]
> Since I don't have Stanley's letter, this is in need of clarification. Is the "regime" talking about the leaders of the fourth international? Or the USSR?
> 
> A: the "internal regime" is referring to the leadership of the party.

Trotsky also criticizes the practice of throwing doubts into the ranks of the party without thoroughly investigating and discussing the issue in the leading bodies of the party. He also notes that comrades will often blame the National Committee for failures at the local level, in order to shirk their own responsibility for building the organization in a professional way. 

Defending the National Committee, Trotsky says that critics have accused the NC of conservatism for defending a standing part of the program. Instead, Trotsky says that this is the *duty* of the NC, to wait for the platform to change before changing the positions of the NC. 

# A letter to James P. Cannon (October 1939)
This letter by Trotsky deals with the brewing storm between the minority and majority factions in the party. Trotsky wanted to elevate the debate from the personal plane to the political, and avoid accusations by both parties that the others just wanted to seize power for themselves. 

In the pursuit of this, Trotsky recommends that the majority offer the minority a deal - an open debate, free from personal insults and threats of expulsion or demotion within the party. He says that if they agree, a productive debate can begin, and anyone who leaves as a result of that debate will be an inevitable loss. On the other hand, he says, if the minority refuses these terms, then their refusal will be the best tool to convince undecided party members of the invalidity of the minority's complaints. 

Trotsky calls for a convention so that this matter can be debated openly, and hopefully a split could be avoided over this debate. 

To me, this speaks of the struggle to hold an organization together through political disagreements. It's important for an open and honest debate to be carried out, without either side afraid that if they lose the debate, they will be punished. Factions should faithfully debate their positions, and then make amends after the party reaches a decision on the actions that will be taken on the matter. This is the essence of [[democratic centralism]] and it's the opposite method of debate from the [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] method that I've talked about with JT, particularly demonstrated by Vyom's conduct (making bold, often personal attacks, and then disappearing when he didn't get his way). 

# A letter to Max Shachtman (November 1939)
Trotsky writes to MS, replying to a speech that the latter had made. First of all, Trotsky questions MS' claim that the Marxists "saw and foresaw" the degeneration of the [[Comintern]] far in advance. To the contrary, he says that there was a possibility of the regeneration of the Comintern, and only the events in [[Germany]] between 1929-33 confirmed the damnation of that organization.

Trotsky continues, saying that we don't draw the same conclusions about the USSR, since the Comintern was a party, and the USSR is a more complex organism filled with interrelated social institutions which could regenerate. 

Throughout this letter, Trotsky tries to get Max to be more concrete about what he was really saying with the speech, trying to push MS to engage with the ideas of the [[Fourth International]] on the political level. 

Trotsky pushes back on [[Shachtman]]'s assertion that uncritical defense of the USSR means support of the bureaucracy that controls the USSR. 

# A letter to James P. Cannon (December 1939)
This letter was included with Trotsky's following article, and he means to prepare Cannon for the reaction to the article. 

Trotsky remarks that the oppositionists are surely going to try and escape an honest political debate, and warns Cannon of this. He also says that the opposition will try to evade the charge that they are a petty bourgeois opposition by saying that there are some workers who agree with them. 

To this claim, Trotsky replies that factions are never "chemically pure," and the real question is who sets the tone within the faction. 

# A petty bourgeois opposition in the Socialist Workers Party (December 1939)
Trotsky argues that we must call things by their correct names, and therefore openly asserts that the minority of the National Commitee represents a petty bourgeois opposition. He says that they share many qualities with historical representatives of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], including a bad attitude towards theory, eclecticism, disrespect for party history and discipline, and the need for personal political independence. 

## Theoretical skepticism and eclecticism
Trotsky describes an article written by comrades Burnham and Shachtman, which he says fails to elevate the discussion to the theoretical plane. He argues that Marxism without the dialectical method is like a clock without a spring, and notes that such attitudes are common in the [[USA]] because of how the country has buried the class struggle so far, leading to a pragmatic mindset of an engineer, an attitude that Trotsky attributes to the authors, particularly Burnham. 

Trotsky argues that the authors, in the case of Burnham, openly reject dialectical materialism, and in the case of Shachtman, reject the need for a conscious method at all. Doing this, Trotsky says, they reject the tie between theory and practice. He explains that just because a worker with a broken tool can sometimes do good work, and a worker with a perfect tool can sometimes make a mistake, we do not invalidate the importance of having a correct tool. 

Trotsky assures us that every worker need not undertake a long study of dialectics. He says that the events of the class struggle influence the workers to think more and more dialectically, but that academics who have had their false beliefs concretized by the [[academy]] must consciously reject those beliefs. 

## Warning and verification
Trotsky gives an overview of his communication with Shachtman, saying that he repeatedly warned Shachtman of the incorrectness of his stance, and critiqued Shachtman's position that theoretical questions were irrelevant to the political struggle. 

As an example of this, Trotsky highlights the fact that thinkers who have rejected the dialectic tend to inevitably reject a political struggle for socialist revolution. He also references a conversation where he was able to tell that a professor rejected the dialectic based on his economic positions. To him, this clearly means that there must be some link between philisophical belief and political stances, in both directions.

## The ABC of materialist dialectics
Trotsky criticizes those who mystify the dialectic, and say that it's impossible to understand. He says that the dialectic and logic have the same relationship as higher and lower mathematics. 

First, he turns to the law of identity, and the fact that "A" does not always equal "A" according to the laws of dialectics. He says that since everything changes over time, after a time period, A does not equal A. Even within a time period, he continues, there are infentisimal changes that make A unequal to A. If we look at an object outside of time, he remarks, we're really looking at it outside of the universe, and nothing really exists outside of time and the universe. 

However, Trotsky notes that we do assume that A = A under some conditions, since we wouldn't be able to operate in the world without this assumption. We simply have to use a dialectic method to determine when quantitative changes add up enough to deserve recategorization as an object with a different quality. 

In this way, Trotsky says that we can use dialectics to view concepts as living phenomenons instead of static images. 

> Hegel wrote before Darwin and before Marx. Thanks to the powerful impulse given to thought by the French Revolution, Hegel anticipated the general movement of science. But because it was only an _anticipation_, although by a genius, it received from Hegel an idealistic character. Hegel operated with ideological shadows as the ultimate reality. Marx demonstrated that the movement of these ideological shadows reflected nothing but the movement of material bodies.

Trotsky says that we should remember that nothing in the universe is eternal, and says that we can be confident that the anti-dialectical mode of analysis represents the past clinging to life. 

## The nature of the USSR
Trotsky turns to the nature of the USSR, saying that Burnham took the position that the USSR was neither a proletarian nor a bourgeois state, without clarifying what it actually was. Trotsky attacks that idea, saying that it causally dismisses the entire Marxist analysis of the state out of hand, and doesn't provide any insight, only confusion.

Trotsky outlines how a good approach to figuring out the question of the nature of the USSR would begin by asking three questions: what is the origin of the USSR? How has the USSR changed since its origin? Have those changes amounted to a qualitative shift in the nature of the USSR?

> The dialectic is not a magic master key for all questions. It does not replace concrete scientific analysis. But it directs this analysis along the correct road, securing it against sterile wanderings in the desert of subjectivism and scholasticism.

Turning to Bruno R, Trotsky chips away at the theory of bureaucratic collectivism. He says that Bruno mistakes the similarity between the outward form of the fascist and Stalinist states for some essential similarity where none exist. Basically, he says, an abandonment of dialectics has caused these critics to totally throw up their hands in the attempt to look at a contradictory object like the USSR. 

## Evolution and dialectics
Trotsky turns to the theory of [[evolution]], which Burnham apparently supports actively. Trotsky says that we must apply this idea to our own thoughts, investingating how our own positions relate to the progression of the history of human thought. He also underlines that evolution is *not* a process of uninterrupted gradual change, and brings the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] up (implicitly). 

## Defense of the USSR
Trotsky critiques the authors for being more concerned about the Soviet actions in Eastern Europe than they are about the strangulation of the [[Spain|Spanish]] revolution. He says that the difference is that the actions in Spain were approved by bourgeois thinkers worldwide, while the actions in Poland and Finland were not. 

## The Soviet-Finnish war
Trotsky accuses the opposition of sharing the same position on the USSR as non-Marxist "leftists," and says that their analysis has no social or class content, relying only on outward appearance and form. He also points out that they flinch from taking concrete positions on much. 

To Trotsky, it's a huge deal that the opposition thinkers fail to mention that the Red Army is inviting the population of occupied areas to expropriate the landlords and bosses. 

> Tomorrow the Stalinists will strangle the Finnish workers. But now they are giving – they are compelled to give – a tremendous impulse to the class struggle in its sharpest form.

He argues that they're calling the USSR "imperialist" even as it wipes out the influence of finance capital in the occupied areas! He notes that an ultimately reactionary regime may be forced to support a progressive development temporarily, and we should not oppose this specifically. 

## "The organizational question"
- Oppositionists want to remove Cannon without debating political positions
- Oppositionists are correct that the real debate is the attitude of party leadership towards political questions in general
	- Opposition = petty bourgeois methods
- We must examine class foundations of the factions
- Must look at historical struggles which were also PB vs proletarian wings
- The opps are defeatist, and say that events have invalidated party slogans when that is false
- Opps have redeeming qualities, and expulsion is not on the table\

# A letter to John G. Wright (December 1939)
Trotsky underlines the need for a sharp political debate and disagreement, alongside a careful organizational strategy to prevent a split. He says that even if or when the petty bourgeois faction becomes a majority, there should be no movement towards a split in the party, and that party patriotism should come first. 

He says this because he's confident that such a petty bourgeois majority would burn itself out, and then the proletarian wing could retake control. 

# A letter to Max Shachtman (December 1939)
Trotsky urges Max to reconsider his position, and says that if he could, he would fly out to discuss the situation with Max for hours on end. 

# Four letters to the National Committee majority
## December 26, 1939
Trotsky advises that the minority should not be allowed to print its positions in the official paper of the organization, and he says that such discussions should be kept to the internal bulletins. He explains that it would be incorrect to have the party program on the same level as every internal debate of the organization. 

Trotsky also notes that permanent protections for a minority viewpoint aren't taken from the Bolshevik playbook, and at some point the party must move on and make a decision according to the external needs of the movement. 

## December 27, 1939
Trotsky reveals that he was surprised that the minority thinkers, Burnham and Shachtman, wanted such publicity. He says they obviously couldn't win an internal battle, and he suspects that they wanted to relieve themselves of the pressure placed on them by bourgeois public opinion. 

He notes that the real damage that these fellows have done is to give the other petty bourgeois radicals, who have so far been afraid to challenge Bolshevism openly, new confidence. He adds that there are also Stalinist interests in provoking a split within the party, and their agents may be at work. 

## January 3, 1940
Trotsky explains his frustration at the need to go over such stale arguments as those made by the opposition. He also argues that Abern's talk of a split is either motivated by a desire for political suicide, or an attempt to frighten the majority. 

## January 4, 1940
Trotsky mentions that Shachtman has failed to respond to his previous letter, and says that this may have symptomatic importance. 

# A letter to Joseph Hansen (January 1940)
Trotsky emphasizes again his desire to avoid a split, and then moves into a discussion of the Soviet invasion of Finland. He says that the invasion has triggered a parallel civil war in Finnish society, and that the poor peasants of the occupied regions have displayed enthusiasm for the land redistribution that the Red Army has implemented. Because of this, he affirms that the strategic stance towards both the invasion of Poland and the invasion of Finland is the same. 

# An open letter to comrade Burnham (January 1940)
Trotsky begins by noting that he has heard of Burnham's refusal to debate the ideas in the article on the petty bourgeois opposition, and that Burnham has labelled dialectics as a religion. He notes that Max Eastman once said the same.

## Is there logic in identifying logic with religion?
Trotsky roasts Burnham for saying that the dialectic is a religious concept. He explains that the dialectic is simply the logic of [[evolution]], and therefore to say that it's somehow religious is to say that all logic is a religious prejudice. 

Trotsky explains the relationship between the logic of Aristotle (formal logic) and the logic of [[Hegel]] (the dialectic). He says that either Burnham is saying that the method of logical analysis hasn't developed whatsoever from the time of Aristotle, alongside the extreme development of our ability to analyze the world, or Burnham is saying that logic itself is supernatural. 

## Is the revolutionist not obliged to fight against religion?
Trotsky says that [[Religion is the opium of the people]], and any worthy revolutionary must struggle against religious currents. He continues, saying that if the dialectical method is truly a religion, why does Burnham not wage a war within the party to expunge this poison instead of simply refusing to discuss it?

Trotsky discusses the proper attitude the Marxist should take towards religious prejudices in the working class:

> Naturally, we maintain the most considerate attitude toward the religious prejudices of a backward worker. Should he desire to fight for our program, we would accept him as a party member; but at the same time, our party would persistently educate him in the spirit of materialism and atheism.

Trotsky lambasts Burnham for having such an illogical and absurd stance on dialectical materialism, on the level of theory and practical action.

## Instructive examples
Trotsky explains that a betrayal of Marxism and communism usually begins with a dismissive or hostile attitude towards dialectical materialism. He gives the examples of Bernstein and Kautsky, both of whom first criticized the dialectic, and then went over to the side of reaction. 

Trotsky also notes the example of [[Plekhanov]], who he says is the exception that proves the rule. He explains that Plekhanov, once he had gone over to the side of reaction, was forced to renounce the dialectic and became a supporter of the categorical imperative instead. Trotsky says his betrayal was due to his inability to really engage with the class struggle, showing that the dialectic *alone* does not make a revolutionary.

Trotsky criticizes Shachtman for using the example of Plekhanov and Liebknecht (who began to criticize the dialectic while in prison at the end of his life) to say that philisophical method is totally irrelevant to the revolutionary. 

## What do you propose instead?
Trotsky begins by saying dialectical materialism isn't an immutable, static truth, it just represents the height of human analysis in *this historical period.* Under socialism, he continues, we will certainly see advances to human thought, which will build on dialectical materialism. 

Trotsky rhetorically asks if there exists such an advancement today, and remarks that if this was the case, the thinkers of the minority would surely not refuse to have a theoretical battle over the dialectic.

He urges the youth not to fall for this bullshit, and to study the thinkers who actually added to the essential texts of Marxism, not these petty bourgeois skeptics. 

## False political "realism"
Trotsky accuses Burnham of seeking to divorce the question of the USSR from any sort of class analysis, and asks if class analysis isn't required, what's the use for Marxism?

Trotsky outlines the history of how there has always been a struggle between those who refused to engage with theory and those who knew it played an essential role in clarifying the movement.

Trotksy makes the point that [[Marxists seek to increase the clarity and confidence of the workers]], and that every struggle should be judged through this lens. 

## The dialectic of the present discussion
Trotsky criticizes the thinkers of the minority for artificially posing "concrete questions" and refusing to have a discussion about their underlying assumptions and theoretical starting points. 

- Conversations must progress from specific to the general to be productive

## "Science" against Marxism and "experiments" against program
Trotsky turns to the demand that the SWP move towards "critical," "experimental," "scientific" politics. He says that this is just pretentious bullshit that reflects the fact that Burnham & co. have totally caved to bourgeois public opinion, and want to be able to associate with those in these circles without having to admit to being Marxists, which is now out of fashion. 

He explains that the science of the working class is Marxism, and there are plenty of experiments to be found in the history of the workers' movement.

Trotsky also touches on the fact that Burnham, Shachtman and others tried to invite bourgeois thinkers to write in the paper, saying this is shamefully bad. 

## "An unconscious dialecticism"
Trotsky remarks that Shachtman once said Burnham was an unconscious dialectician. Trotsky says this is sort of true, since everyone uses dialectics to one degree or another to function in the world. 

To him, this reflects the fact that dialectics are not an arbitrary construction, but truly represent the way movement works. However, Trotsky continues, this is no excuse for Burnham's refusal to engage with the dialectic openly. 

## The dialectic and Mr. Dies
Trotsky says that while workers naturally see the superiority of dialectical reasoning, it takes conscious effort for bourgeois or petty bourgeois to overcome their irrationalities. 

Trotsky turns to the topic of the Dies Committee, which he supported entering but the opposition did not. I'm not sure what this committee was, so I don't understand the issue at hand. 

UPDATE: the Dies Committee was an early incarnation of the House Un-American Activities Committee. 

## "Concrete political questions"
Trotsky attacks the minority as being weakest in the place they feel most confident - day to day questions. He says that their analysis of the Soviet invasion of eastern Europe totally misses the fact that the masses have been energized by the Red Army's call for factory seizures and land expropriation. 

## Theoretical bewilderment and political abstentionism
Trotsky explains that the two fundamental features of the opposition are a lack of unifying ideas and a tendency towards abstentionism. By the first, he means that the opposition tends to look at all world events seperate from one another, and refuses to learn lessons that apply across situations. By the second, he says that they prefer withdrawing from the real struggle and waiting for a perfectly correct side to appear. 

Trotsky cites their stance on the Soviet-Finnish war as an example, saying that the minority wants to call for the downfall of both sides of the conflict, and refuses to take sides, therefore placing itself outside of the historical process. 

## The petty bourgeoisie and centralism
Trotsky explains how the organizational method of the opposition is reflective of a petty bourgeois approach to political organizing - endless discussion, a fetishization of individuality and expression, and a lack of central will. Fundamentally, he says that such people don't view the party as a tool for proletarian revolution, but as a book club. Trotsky says that once a few thousand workers join the party, they will "call the petty bourgeois anarchists severly to order." In short, [[The petty bourgeois political method is toxic]]. 

## Conclusions
Trotsky concludes by providing some recommendations for the party's future. He says that they must re-orient to the proletariat, and must send petty bourgeois intellectuals to make connections with working people, or else be removed from their positions. He urges the party to condemn the unserious and incorrect practices of the oppositionists, and to test all the members of the party in the hard, practical work of the class struggle. 

> The class composition of the party must correspond to its class program. The American section of the Fourth International will either become proletarian or it will cease to exist.

# A letter to James P. Cannon (January 1940)
Trotsky sends a short message to Cannon, relaying the fact that he understood that some were displeased that he spent so much time talking about dialectics in his open letter, but that this was an essential course of action to begin the education of the party.

# A letter to Farrell Dobbs (January 1940)
Trotsky says that he has so far not discussed two questions: the question of the "bureaucratic conservative" nature of the majority faction, and the insistance of the minority that Trotsky has "falsely defended Moliner."

As for the first question, Trotsky asks what the character of bureaucratic conservatism is, and what interests are represented by this layer. He says that bureaucratic conservatism reflects the interests of the privledged workers' bureaucracy, especially in the USSR. He says that therefore it's stupid to look for traces of this mentality in the SWP majority, and even if individual leaders such as Cannon have traits of this mentality, then the majority must support him *in spite* of this characteristic. Any conclusion otherwise, he says, is an attempt to propose psychological analysis for a political question.

As for the second question, Trotsky underlines the difference between his *disagreement* with the incorrect ideas of former comrade Moliner, and his attitude towards the comrade. He says that while he never agreed with Moliner, he was against expelling him until the comrade published a paper attempting to un-democratically change the program. He says that his personal attitude has always been patient with individuals, even when he vigorously disagrees with their political perspectives. Trotsky adds that some comrades have "inherited some Comintern venom" and tend to use expulsion too liberally. 

# A letter to John G. Wright (January 1940)
Trotsky writes to Wright to agree with the latter's appraisal of the latest pamphlet of Shachtman, which, according to Trotsky, is a pathetic break with Bolshevism and Marxism in every line. Trotsky says that he will have to devote some time to a criticism of the document.

# A letter to James P. Cannon (January 1940)
Trotsky sends a short note to Cannon explaining that his dismissal of Shachtman's open letter will be about the same length as his letter to Burnham.

# A letter to William F. Warde (January 1940)
Trotsky writes to Warde suggesting the formation of an association that could begin the theoretical education of the party in regards to dialectical materialism. 

# A letter to Joseph Hansen (January 1940)
Trotsky gives some organizational recommendations to Hansen with the goal of avoiding a split. He says that rumors are swirling that the minority is preparing a split, and wants to act like a persecuted victim. To prevent this, Trotsky recommends a proposal: protection of the rights of the minority, the creation of an internal discussion bulletin, and no unnecessary restrictions on factional activity.

He says that while this is an unusual step, it's far preferable to a split. He says that we ought not be bureaucrats, but dialecticians in this situation. He says that if the discussion can be carried out well, the party will benefit no matter the outcome. 

# From a scratch - to the danger of gangrene (January 1940)
Trotsky calls for the discussion to go through to the end, but also to cast out and expel any Stalinist provocateurs who he says are certainly within the party advocating for a split, within both sides of the debate.

He says that the discussion has revealed the dire need for theoretical education within the party, but Trotsky holds out hope on the basis of the cadres. He asserts the necessity for such a "philisophical" education.

Attacking Shachtman, Trotsky says that while the former is a talented journalist, he is more concerned with the press and with literature than he is with the life and death facts of the working class and the vanguard. He attribues this to a petty bourgeois orientation. 

Trotsky apologizes in advance for the need to follow M.S. through all his zig-zagging trains of thought, which Trotsky attributes to an attempt to cover up his own contradictory ideas and stances. He says that his intent is to counterpose the proletarian position to the petty bourgeois one.

## "Precedents"
Trotsky says that Shachtman's main arguement is to say that they are still revolutionists based on their past positions, and asks Trotsky to give examples of petty bourgeois deviation within the last few years. Trotsky explains that he can turn this very arguement against Shachtman. 

Trotsky agrees, and proceeds to give such examples:

## One
Trotsky examines Shachtman's conduct towards a faction in the Socialist Party in 1937. He says that the latter was much too willing to praise and bend over for a petty bourgeois section of the party, and misunderstood that such a faction had no class basis in the working class. 

## Two
Trotsky says that he repeatedly brought up the proposal of including as many workers as possible in the work of the organization in order to counterweigh the intellectuals who were already inside, but that Shachtman was never interested in this idea, and didn't really pay attention to the issue. 

## Three
Trotsky defends himself against accusations that he brought up the idea of a petty bourgeois deviation out of nowhere. Instead, he replies, he was talking about this possibility for many years before he began to criticize Shachtman. Trotsky says that he always called for the intellectuals to be bound to the factory workers through daily activity. 

## Four
Trotsky criticizes Shachtman for being more concerned with the sensibilities of liberals who were only temporarilly supporting the party than he was concerned with the actual growth and ideological firmness of the workers' movement. 

## Five
Trotsky displays further evidence of his criticism of Eastman.

## Six
Trotsky highlights a letter in which he questions Shachtman about why he's so friendly with liberals who only want to appear reasonable while actually undercutting revolutionary movements at every chance they get. 

## Seven
Trotsky mentions the fact that he often tried to get the paper of the SWP to become more of a active tool of agitation, while Shachtman always seemed more interested in academic discussions. 

## Eight
...

## Nine
...

## Ten
...

## The philisophic bloc against Marxism
Trotsky says that his opponents claim that he is only talking about dialectical materialism as a dodge of certain practical questions, but Trotsky explains that he was talking about Marxist philosophy and the need to increase the party's educational level far before these concrete evnets appeared. 

He criticizes the narrow-mindedness of those who say that a party is just supposed to have specific positions on concrete events of the day. He says that the revolutionary party is totally opposite of all bourgeois political parties, and that the revolutionary party must have a worked out conception of the world, economics, politics, and philosophy to defend itself from the pressure of bourgeois society. 

Trotsky distinguishes between political blocs, which he says can be justified based on the situation, and philisophical betrayal of Marxism, which he says can never be justifiable in the revolutionary party. 

## The abstract and the concrete; economics and politics
Trotky quotes Shachtman's claim that we cannot deduce our policy towards a "specific" war based on the "abstract" class character of the states involved. He says that this whole statement is total bullshit, and that it would be just as right to say that we cannot deduce a policy towards a war based on "abstract" notions that the war is imperialist, and that we must use "specific" class characteristics of the states involved. 

Trotsky attacks the idea that since dialectical materialism doesn't directly and literally determine our political positions, it must be useless. He explains that while [[evolution]] doesn't literally cause the birth of a baby pig, we still have to examine the rules of evolution to explain the development of species in general. 

Trotsky discusses the relationship between the abstract and the concrete. He says that to obtain a concrete concept, we must combine several abstract ones, in the same way that a movie needs multiple static frames at once to demonstrate a living character. 

> The concrete is a combination of abstractions - not an arbitrary or subjective combination but one that corresponds to the laws of the movement of a given phenomenon.

I think this makes perfect sense - [[Concrete perspectives are combinined abstractions]], and [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. 

Trotsky goes on to criticize Shachtman's call for political revolution in the USSR as illogical based on Shachtman's own ideas. If, Trotsky asks, the USSR's class character directly reflects the politics of the bureaucracy, and the USSR is a workers' state, then why is revolution needed? On the other hand, he continues, if the USSR is no longer a workers' state, then a *social* revolution is needed, isn't it?

Trotsky points out that Shachtman's support of political revolution only makes sense if you assume the very things that Shachtman disputes - the workers' state and the *in*direct link between the social nature of the state and the politics of the bureaucracy. 

## Shachtman makes a bloc - also with Lenin
Trotsky explains another argument that Shachtman made against him: Shachtman quotes Lenin's criticism of Trotsky along the lines that Trotsky mistakenly said the USSR was a workers' state when it's really a workers' and peasants' state. However, Trotsky points out, Lenin went back on this point not two months later, saying that Trotsky was indeed correct! 

Trotsky notes how important the class nature of the USSR was to Lenin, and asks why Shachtman seems to pay it little mind. 

Trotsky absolutely roasts Shachtman:

> Shachtman declares: “The given state is not merely a degenerated workers’ state but ...” ... but? Shachtman has nothing further to say. Both the orator and the audience stare at each other, mouths wide open.

## "Concentrated economics"
Trotsky says that Shachtman tries to use Lenin's phrase "Politics is concentrated economics" to attack Trotsky's supposed elevation of economic facts (nationalized production) over political facts ("imperialist policy"). Trotsky defends himself, saying that this phrase of Lenin's means that we must base political slogans on economic facts, and try to express the manifest the progressive nature of economic forces in our political work. 

## Comparison with bourgeois wars
Trotsky says that Shachtman claims that bourgeois wars were at one time progressive, therefore we cannot analyze a war just based on the class nature of the state. Trotsky counters that bourgeois wars were only progressive when all of bourgeois rule was progressive, a time long since past. Trotsky says that Shachtman refuses to elaborate on this train of thought, since he seems to be saying that the USSR is now a reactionary force on the economic plane, just as the bourgeois order is. However, Trotsky continues, Shachtman doesn't want to say that, so he just abruptly halts his analysis. 

[[Trotsky openly admits his pre-Bolshevik mistakes]]

# Ideas
Trotsky advises the SWP to include members of the minority in leadership positions if they agree to abide by the will of the party (214, 217). This displays his desire for unity, even in the face of an unserious, malicious petty bourgeois tendency. 

Trotsky notes that a solid theoretical perspective, a scientific program, and a consistency is needed to construct a revolutionary party (216). He says that the opposition has none of this, and is doomed to fail as an independent force. 

Trotsky gives a shout-out to [[The Struggle for a Proletarian Party (1943)]], saying that the internal debate would be worth it if it merely produced this text (219). This is interesting, since that book has some serious issues. Maybe Trotsky was just choosing his battles at this point? Cannon's perspective might have revealed traces of Zinovievism, but it was a hell of a lot better than the Minority. 

Trotsky degrades [[moralism]], saying that whenever a high minded intellectual begins talking about morality, hold on to your wallet (222). I agree, since [[Morality is historically contingent]], those who attempt to leverage morality end up defending the current cultural situation which has grown out of [[capitalism]]. 

Continuing his discussion of morality, Trotsky argues that proletarian revolutionists shouldn't shed tears over the intensity of the class struggle in the way that petty bourgeois do (231). This is a confirmation that we must [[Never confuse morality and strategy]]. It also echoes the way in which [[Lenin criticised Kautsky's definition of imperialism]], saying that [[Kautsky]] was attempting to reverse the heightening of contradictions, whereas revolutionaries seek to accelerate and clarify this process. 

Trotsky provocatively affirms that "the safeguarding of the socialist revolution comes before formal democratic principles" (231). This is a spicy take, but ultimately I agree. However, I would emphasize the *formal* in this sentence. I think that ultimately, people have a right to self-determination and if they genuinely don't want to build socialism, then any attempt to do so would be bloody, desperate, and ultimately doomed. The bourgeois democratic structures in society have a warping effect on popular will, and we should not get bogged down in moralism and defense of these warped reflections of democracy. 

Trotsky explains the accuracy of Marxist analysis, saying that all we can do is sketch the possible directions of development, and says that the more concrete a perspective is, the more easily it can change based on changing circumstances (234). I agree, and we should be sure not to over-state the predictive powers of [[dialectical materialism]]. Of course, it has a lot of power, but this tool involves re-calculation at all stages. 

Trotsky argues in favor of the defense of the USSR by stating that we have to look at the class nature of both sides, and the global context. He says that Marxists should support the struggle of a colonial bourgeois state against an imperialist one because it weakens imperialism, regardless of the bourgeois nature of the colonial state. He explains that this has nothing to do with a moral appraisal of the regimes (235).

Trotsky defends his analysis of [[fascism]] against the theorists of the now-split Workers' Party, saying that the latter intellectuals were befuddled by the contradictory nature of fascism, which he explains introduces an element of state planning *in order to preserve private property* (245). I agree, and I think that his analysis of fascism is miles better than most on the left today, who sink to "terminological terrorism" and call all right-wing elements fascist. 

Clarifying his stance on conscription at the onset of [[WW2]], Trotsky says that Marxists should support conscription since workers' support it along with the war effort in general, but Marxists should advocate a conscription done *by the workers on their own terms,* instead of rallying workers behind the bourgeois state (249). This is similar to his ideas of what workers should do during the Spanish Civil War. He said that the workers need to fight against fascism independently of the capitalists and the bourgeois state, since the latter couldn't be trusted to defeat the fascists. Trotsky has a great way of cutting through the bourgeois posing of political questions to expose the proletarian position on things.
