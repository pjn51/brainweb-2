# Preface
This was published after Marx's death. It was found by Engels among Marx's notes. The basic function of this text is to work as a summary of the first volume of Capital. 

 # Preliminary
There existed, at the time, a large movement for increased wages in Europe. Weston had defended, in the International Association of Workingmen, unpopular ideas. Marx agrees with the underlying argument, but says that the way Weston is making his case is incorrect and dangerous. 

# 1. Production and Wages
Weston's argument rested on two premises. First, that the amount of national production is a fixed quantity. He also assumed that the amount of real [[wages]] (see [[Wage Labor and Capital (1849)#Relation of Wage-Labor to Capital|Marx's other work on real wages]]) were fixed.

The first assumption is false. The amount of goods produced changes drastically over time. It is not a constant, but a variable magnitude. If we instead suppose the amount of national production to be a constant, Weston would still be incorrect. Even if national production remained fixed, the ratio of wages to profits could change. Therefore, the workers could still get a wage increase. Therefore, the fixed nature of production does not lead to the fixed nature of wages. 

Even if it did, this fixed nature of wages would cut both ways. The capitalists would be unable to force a temporary decrease in *real* wages, as they were doing. 

Basically, the idea that real wages are fixed is absurd. 

## Reading Questions
1. **How does the value and mass of national production change, when the scale of production changes?**
2. **How does the value and mass of national production change, when the productive power of labour changes?**
3. **Why does John Weston assume that the real value of wages is fixed?** His outlook is severely undialectical and he assumes that the amount of wealth in society is fixed at an arbitrary point. 
4. **Why can we not assume that the real value of wages is fixed?** We can verify this by history, and we know that things such as wages are not set at arbitrary points, but are related to other things like supply and demand. 

# 2. Production, Wages, Profits
Weston's main argument could be summarized thusly:

If the workers force the bosses to pay *x* more in wages, then the bosses will make sure that the products they give to the workers are *x* more expensive than they were before, resulting in no transfer of real wealth to the workers. 

Weston says that this is because the amount of real wages is fixed. But if it is fixed, why is it fixed at the place where it's at? Why not less or more? Weston doesn't provide an answer to this important question. 

Marx explains that the prices of [[commodities]] are determined by an interaction of economic forces outside the grasp of any individual capitalist. He says that when wages rise, the only way in which the price of commodities will be affected is thorugh supply and demand (Marxist Classics v.1, p.52). 

An increase in the wages of the workers would increase the demand for commodities. That would increase their price in the market. However, this only holds for *necesseties*. What about unnecessary goods, and luxury goods? The rise in wages generally would *not* result in an increase in demand for luxury goods, and therefore the rate of profit in those industries would decline since the capitalists wouldn't be able to compensate themselves for the increased share of the [[surplus value]] going to the worker. 

Marx explains that this decline in the rate of profit of one sphere of production, always leads to the flight of [[capital]] towards those industries with higher rates of profit. In this scenario, he says, more [[capital]] would begin to be employed in the realm of necessities since that area would now have a higher relative rate of profit compared to luxuries. According to him, this would increase the supply of commodities, counteracting the increased rate of demand, and decreasing the price of those commodities down again (MC v.1, p.53). He's saying that [[Profit tends towards equalization across industries]]. 

The fall in the rate of profit caused by the increase in wages would become generalized across the whole economy, and equilibrium would be reached again. 

Of course, this supposes that the whole of the new wages would be spent on necessities, and not on luxuries. Even if the workers spent their new wages on products new to them, luxury products, their increased purchasing power would cause a decreased purchasing power on the part of the capitalists, meaning total demand for luxury goods would be unchanged. Therefore, prices would be unchanged. 

We can see a historical example in the rise of wages in Britain between 1849 to 1869. Parliament instituted a cap of 10 hrs of work per day in 1848. This amounted to a general rise in wages across the board. The capitalist journals predicted, nay proved, doom and gloom for British industry forever. This doom never came. Instead, prices of commodities dropped, wages rose, and more labor was employed than ever before. 

The same situation can be seen in English agriculture. A 40% increase in the average wages of agricultural hands corresponded to a tremendus decrease in the cost of agricultural products. 

>...an increased demand will, in some instances, leave the market prices of commodities altogether unchanged, and will, in other instances, cause a temporary rise of market prices followed by an increased supply, followed by a reduction of the prices to their original level, and in many cases below their original level.

To summarize, higher wages can only increase prices if they increase demand for certain commodities. This would increase the rate of profit in the affected industries, and lower them relatively in all others. Production of the affected industries would increase due to competition among the capitalists, and then the additional supply would decrease the prices of the commodities.

2. **Why is it problematic to assume that capitalists will respond to an increase in wages with an increase in the prices of commodities?**
3. **How does the historical evidence contradict John Westonâ€™s argument about the relationship between wages and other commodity prices?**
