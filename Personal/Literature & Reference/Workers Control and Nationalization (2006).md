In [[Venezuela]], we see the system of co-management being introduced. This is the way in which the working class there is struggling to move towards socialism. 

## Principles of workers’ control
[[Trotsky]] says the first step towards workers’ control is the abolition of trade secrets. By doing this, the workers can see the real situation of the company they work for, and can see through the lies of management about the need for cuts, etc. This lifts the veil and shows the working class how much money is truly being sucked up by the capitalist class. 

This increased involvement of the workers in the accounting and management of their companies will also prepare them for full takeover through [[economic planning|nationalization]] of industries as a whole. 

Direct management of companies by the workers is an unstable situation. It will quickly be reined in by the capitalists, or will proceed to full-blown nationalization. 

Any worker involvement in management that is stable and long lasting is the result of class collaboration taking the place of class struggle. 

The wave of “economic democracy” that swept Europe in the 70s was a result of militant [[unions]]. The bosses wanted to safely incorporate the [[labor aristocracy]] into the workings of industry in order to pacify the movement. These organs of workers' participation are toothless and let the workers let off steam without controlling anything. They also create a stratum of privileged workers who are easy for the bosses to buy off. 

As opposed to this, we see revolutionary workers’ control in Venezuela. This shows the offensive drive of the workers, and the retreat of the capitalist class. However, control of an individual enterprise by the workers will always be crushed by the rest of the capitalist class, even if productivity increases. 
This naturally leads the workers to challenge [[capital]] across enterprises, and eventually across whole industries. 

Workers’ control over industry will be challenged by sabotage, counterrevolution, and the forces of the global market. 

## Workers’ control vs management
Control comes from factory committees on the shop floor, from below.
Management comes from centralized workers’ councils and proletarian state power. 

## Marxism vs syndicalism
We don’t want to simply have workers own their own companies, we want to move beyond competition, beyond the market, and beyond capitalism. Profits shouldn't be redivided among the workers, they should be directed by society. 

We believe that the management board should be composed of: 1/3 from workers in the industry, 1/3 from from the working class as a whole, and 1/3 from the workers’ state. 

## The Soviet experience
Control and planning can only take place based on the level of technique of the time. This level was very very low during the [[Russia|Russian]] revolution of 1917. Management of industry couldn’t be taken into the hands of the workers, and even had to remain under capitalist control after the revolution for some time. 

Trotsky said in 1917 that control was possible, while management was not. The workers had enough power to make sure that the factories were run in the interest of society but not enough to move any farther.

The program of workers’ control was spontaneous and was not invented by the Bolsheviks. It was primarily defensive, to protect against the closure of factories by the bosses. 

[[Bolsheviks]], recognizing the impossibility of moving forward to socialism, set up a regime of workers control and bided their time for a revolution in a more developed country to give them the tools that the workers needed. 

The Bolsheviks did nationalize the banks, giving their new state a powerful economic tool and an institution to organize the economy around. 

The bosses of course reacted to these measures. They sabotaged their factories or abandoned them. This led to direct worker takeover and punitive nationalizations. A brand of syndicalism was taking hold of the working class that threatened to destabilize the already rocky economic situation. Their attempts to achieve “socialism in one company” were causing the same issues of anarchy of production seen under capitalism. The workers simply become a new body of shareholders. 

At the same time as this was happening, the bourgeois specialists were refusing to work. Many were very reactionary and assumed that they could wait out the new regime. The USSR was forced to compromise by paying specialists higher wages than the rest of the workers. 

During this, the civil war was beginning. The central government was forced to quickly nationalize the commanding heights of the economy to use for the war effort. 

## The Yugoslavian Experience
The economy of [[Yugoslavia]] was formally state-owned, but independently managed and operated by workers’ councils in each company. These companies competed with one another on the open market. 

The Yugoslavian bureaucracy said that the centralization of the USSR had led to degeneration into “state capitalism.” While the USSR did degenerate, this was because of a lack of economic democracy, not due to centralization. 

Workplaces were really controlled by the bureaucracy, who had the power to appoint factory directors and make central investment decisions. 

In the 60s, economic crisis sent the Yugoslavian economy spiraling. In response, the bureaucracy moved further towards market mechanisms. The state monopoly on international trade was abolished, and the [[currency]] was made convertible. 

The bureaucracy claimed that the workers were in control through their individual factory councils. However, since individual firms were pitted against one another, it was really market forces and the interests of capital that ruled society. Workers were forced to lower their own wages, to fire their own coworkers, in order to stay within the bounds of the market and reproduce capital. 

These market reforms caused inequality to increase, and the control of industries fell more and more to the specialists, who were experts at increasing productivity and profitability. If the economy was planned centrally and democratically, the expertise of the specialists would have become a tool of the working class. Instead, the specialists generally increased their own profits at the expense of other sections of the working class. 

These reforms, which also included dismantling the central state banking apparatus, caused dissent and protest against the market. Students and youth, as well as those from poorer regions, led a rebellion that culminated in the seven-day occupation of the University of Belgrade, under the slogan, “Down with the Red Bourgeoisie.” Because of this, planning was brought back in a sense. However, it wasn’t genuine workers’ democracy. Instead, firms negotiated five year investment deals with the state. 

Through the history of [[Yugoslavia]], we can see that the question of centralization versus decentralization is less important than the question of who really holds power under either of these plans. Decentralization is no more inherently democratic than tight centralization is. 

Another interesting quirk of self-management was the practice of employment. Firms did not often fire or lay people off, and they didn't often hire new people. Since the income of the workers was tied to profits, the more workers a factory had, the less the wages would be. This led to a mass emmigration to Western Europe of those seeking work. 

This process also atomized the working class, pitting industry against industry, region against region. This regionalism and factionalism of different sections of the bureaucracy eventually led to the balkanization of the region that we see today. 

## Workers’ Control and the Venezuelan Revolution
The situation in [[Venezuela]] first of all shows us that workers can run very complex firms on their own. The workers at PDVSA (the state-owned oil company) demonstrate this. 

While co-management is enshrined in the constitution, it is done so in an unclear way. This doesn't really matter, because workers’ ownership is not a matter of what the law makes it, but of what the workers themselves make it. A revolutionary situation is precisely one where the workers move beyond respect for the law, and instead impose their own will. 

The VZ working class has shown determination in the class struggle against the managers. In 2002-03, the bosses tried to stage a lockout at PDVSA. The workers broke through the bosses’ defenses, and ran the company on their own, despite sabotage by the managers. A similar thing happened at CADAFE (the state electricity company). 

PDVSA has returned to management along capitalist lines, but tension is increasing once again in the industry. 

The workers understand the real differences between symbolic workers participation and real control of the economy, and publish political pamphlets and have their own organizations. However, it is important that workers’ control extend to the entire working class. If PDVSA was controlled only by that firm’s workers, they would control over 70% of the Venezuelan economy. This is not a balanced way to democratically run things. 

In order to prevent groups of workers from going down the path of individual enrichment like this, a strong workers’ state is needed. 

In general, the discussion among the workers on co-management is very advanced. In some cases, it’s more advanced than what the workers were talking about in Russia in 1917, and this is all without a prominent revolutionary party to guide them!

Fundamentally, the struggle in Venezuela is moving towards [[socialism]]. The process of revolutionary co-management will be incomplete and unstable, like a Schrodinger’s cat of power dynamics, until the workers take full control, and the state expropriates the whole of the capitalist class. 

This article was written in 2006, I’d love to see what has happened in this struggle in the 14 years since. 

Update: as of August 2020, a leftist alternative coalition is being formed in Venezuela, to provide a revolutionary way out of the current crisis. This coalition includes the Venezuelan section of the [[IMT]], *Lucha de Clases*. They will run candidates in the upcoming general election.
