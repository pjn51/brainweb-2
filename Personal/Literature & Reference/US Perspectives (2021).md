# Introduction
This is the draft document comprising the US perspectives of Socialist Revolution, the [[USA|American]] section of the [[IMT]], to be voted on at the 2021 National Congress of Socialist Revolution. 

# 1. Perspectives for revolutionary socialism in the US
The authors cite [[Marx]] and [[Engels]]' conception of the historical justification for [[capitalism]], saying that such justification stopped being relevant many decades ago, and that the objective prerequisites for [[socialism]] exist today. 

They continue, saying that these perspectives consist of a "general appraisal" of the past and an analysis of the objective conditions that we find ourselves in. In general, they say that this document seeks to draw conclusions from the last period and outline the dynamics that we must contend with now. 

# 8. A political sea change
The CC explains how a whole generation began to move towards revolutionary ideas in the wake of the 2008 crisis, even though the [[proletariat|working class]] backlash was delayed by shock and confusion, and channeled through the inadequacies of the Occupy movement. 

The CC turns to the first shockwaves of the BLM movement, with the killings of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, and Michael Brown- leading to the most significant mass protest in American history. 

Adding to this, the CC explains how class anger was reflected in the success of the Sanders campaign in 2016. They point out that if Sanders had ran as an independent socialist candidate, it could have elevated the class struggle, but he chose to capitulate to the [[Democratic Party]] instead, confusing the situation. However, the CC notes that a socialist movement was reborn in the US around this time, despite Bernie's surrender. 

Catalyzed by this situation, an opposite trend emerged, the CC says. They argue that the rise of [[Trump]] represented the rotenness of the "consensus" of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] democracy and [[liberalism]]. 

In the state apparatus, the CC explains, the military, or the streets, the cracks in the foundation of capitalism are more and more apparent. They cite the global increase in support for socialism and [[communism]], the massive waves of protest, and the division in the ruling classes of most major countries. 

# 25. The impact of 2020
The CC explains that 2020 was a year of unprecedented crisis, where many workers were pushed towards confrontation as their bosses chose to sacrifice them rather than delay profits. They note that at the height of the pandemic, the U6 jobless rate rose to 28%, higher than in the Great Depression. They add that issues hit the most marginalized communities the hardest. 

Turning to the 2020 election, the CC argues that the bourgeois press was correct to frame it as a race against Sanders. They note that the only way that [[Biden]] was able to secure a victory was by having 6 candidates simultaneously drop out and endorse him, bringing in their bases of support and leading to Sanders suspending his campaign, which was a punch in the gut for millions.

# 37. The murder of George Floyd
The authors describe the events that caused the BLM protests to begin - the killing of Floyd, the pandemic, and [[Trump]] all added to the anger. They outline how Black activists began the fight, and workers of every ethnicity quickly joined to demand change in protests across the country, and eventually involved 10% of the entire population. They explain that the National Guard deployment, to 30 states, was the largest peacetime military operation in US history. 

# 43. A glimpse of revolution
The CC describes the burning of the Minneapolis police precinct, the 50% support that the action had nationwide, and the spontaneous creation of working class patrols to keep the peace. 

Noting the division in the ruling class, the CC recalls the opposition that emerged in the military leadership to the domestic deployment of troops. They argue that since the rank and file troops come "overwhelmingly from low-income working-class households," military advisors knew that their use against protestors would lead to the weakening of the state apparatus.

> I've heard the claim that soldiers tend to be from low-income origin is false. I need to look into this. 

The CC puts forward their stance, which is that a well-organized [[Marxism|Marxist]] force should have advocated for a mobilization of the labor movement in a general-strike, and for the self-defence committees to be organized into mass assemblies across the country.

If these things had happened, the authors explain, we would have seen the beginnings of a situation of [[dual power]]. 

However, the CC explains, this is not what happened. Instead, they say, the movement was cynically watered down and co-opted by the [[Democratic Party]]. 

# 55. Polarization, racism, and the "culture wars"
The CC points to the fact that racism is essential for the operation of modern capitalism, just as the colonization of North [[USA|America]] and slavery were essential for the rise of American capitalism. They say that a movement to defeat racism must be a revolutionary socialist movement that unites the entire working class against capitalism. However, the authors say that this movement is in ebb, and a clear sign of this is the rightwing attacks on the right to vote in recent times. 

The CC explains that the ruling class seeks to paint the question of racism as a "culture war" issue in order to divide the working class, while pitting [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] [[academy|academics]] against [[religion|religious]] conservatives to cloud the waters. 

The authors outline the Marxist position on oppression - we must examine the connections between all forms of racism and determine how to strike at the class foundations of such oppression in order to change it.

The CC argues that while white capitalists and the white [[petty bourgeoisie]] benefit from racism - by being able to pay their workers less as the workers attack each other, the white working class does not benefit from this arrangement in the long run. 

Criticizing critical race theory, the authors say that this line of thinking obscures the fact that both black and white workers have the same objective interests and are looking for solutions to the same problems, which can only be solved through working class struggle on a united basis. 

The CC describes the rising sense of class rage - 17% of Americans and 35% of those under 30 feel that violent action against the rich is sometimes justified. 

# 73. A balance sheet of Trumpism
The CC explains that the Democrats cannot rely on a layer of workers who were their traditional base due to presidents such as FDR and LBJ. They note that the shift of these workers into the GOP led to the bourgeoisie losing their grip on the GOP, allowing a candidate like Trump to temporarily change the course of the party. 

The CC describes how Trump's core base is an "unholy cross-class alliance" of lumpen, petty bourgeois, bourgeois, and even [[fascism|fascist]] elements. They say that his campaign won the support of a layer of the working class, but that the latter are not really a big part of Trump's core supporters. 

To support this, the CC cites statistics that reveal while Obama won 60% of union households, Clinton only won 51% with Trump winning 43%. In 2020, they continue, Trump retained the support of 40% while Biden secured 56%, representing a significant division in the working class. 

The CC emphasizes that this shift rightward is in the context of very limited options. They also reinforce the point that we shouldn't over-emphasize the power of the American right wing - while loud and well funded, they are numerically weak.
