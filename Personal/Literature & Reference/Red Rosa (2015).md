# Review
This is a graphic novel about the life and ideas of [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. It has a surprisingly high political level, with decent explanations about [[Marxism|Marxist]] economics. It's very moving and inspiring, which is a feat for telling one of the most tragic stories of the 20th century workers' movement. 

The art style is terrible though haha.
