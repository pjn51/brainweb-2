# Review
This book, by Michael Pollan, deals with an investigation of the positive benefits of [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, and other psychadelic drugs. I never ended up finishing it, since it seemed like every chapter was saying the same thing: "Wow, shrooms are so cool and changed my life! They should be more widely studied!"

# Ideas
Bill Richards has the idea that consciousness is a property of the universe and the human brain is like a radio receiver. 

They talk a bit about how psychedelics fueled the counterculture of the 60s, and the Nixon administration clamped down on psychadelics to cut off the fuel. I disagree. The way I see it, the counterculture was going to look around for any way to rebel. Finding LSD was inevitable. And the state made these drugs illegal because by doing so, they could raid counterculture areas, arrest users, and turn the public against the movement. I don't think that psychadelics gave the hippies any sort of new insight that they weren't already developing.
