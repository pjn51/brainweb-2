> In this autobiography, written by [[Trotsky]] during his exile in [[Turkey]], he lays out the course of his life from his childhood as the son of a middle-class [[peasantry|peasant]] up until his exile from the [[Russia|USSR]]. 

# Introduction by Alan Woods
Fighting against the lie that [[Lenin]] and Trotsky were enemies, [[Alan Woods]] quotes Lenin's appraisal of Trotsky as the only man who could have built the Red Army (xvi). 

Woods mentions the campaign to assasinate the Tsar, which began a few months before Trotsky was born, carried out by the *[[Narodniks|Narodnaya Volya]]* (xvii). 

# Foreword by Leon Trotsky
Introducing this work, Trotsky says that he doesn't mean to be objective. He explains that since he's writing about his life, there's no need to hide his likes and dislikes, and that those who claim objectivity tend to merely hide their preferences more cleverly (lxii). 

> To understand the causal seqence of events and to find somewhere in the sequence one's own place - this is the first duty of a revolutionary. And at the same time, it is the greatest personal satisfaction possible for a man who does not limit his tasks to the present day (lxvii).

# 5. Country and town
Discussing his aversion to empiricism, Trotsky says that he always preferred the general to the particular, and while this sometimes led him to make hasty generalizations, it was essential to a revolutionary outlook, and he only felt satisfied when he felt that he understood the general currents of events (75).

# 8. My first prisons
During his time in prison, Trotsky writes, he studied Freemansonry to keep busy. He explains that he was interested in the way that the secret society, with its code of morality and tradition, arose out of the decay of feudalism. His conclusion was that the old order's morality and way of life was disitegrating faster than a new one could replace it, causing members of the middle classes to clutch at the traditions of the past and safeguard the old way of life (104). This is an interesting example of how [[Morality is historically contingent]] shapes society during epochs of revolution.  

# 9. My first exile
Trotsky tells us that in both prison and exile, the only thing that could save him was rigorous intellectual work. He wrote profusely in both cases, and notes that the Marxists were the only ones who were trying to stay sharp as opposed to turning to drink or even suicide (109). 

Trotsky recounts the first time he met an [[Anarchism|Anarchist]]. He explains that he asked this fellow how trains would operate under anarchy, and the anarchist said, "Why the hell should I want to travel on railways under anarchism?" Trotsky says that this was all he really needed to know about that school of thought (111)! 

The author explains his difficult decision to escape exile, saying that he already had two daughters with his first wife, Alexandra Lvovna. He says that she was actually the one who told him he must go, since duty to the revolution was more important than personal considerations to both of them. He explains that life separated them, but they remained friends for life (114). 

# 10. My first escape
Recounting the drama of his escape across the Austrian border, Trotsky says that his guide told him to climb on his back so that he wouldn't get muddy (since that would raise suspicion after the crossing). The guide later warned Trotsky that he should be wary of Jews on the other side, not knowing that Trotsky himself was of Jewish descent (118). 

On the other side of the border, he continues, he rode in an old farmer's cart. The going was treacherous, he says, since there were lots of soldiers about and they would shoot at you in the night if they saw a stranger. He describes how their cart tipped over in the mud, causing Trotsky to lose his glasses - and a chicken began screaming since it was trapped under the wheel. He explains the drama of this situation as the farmer quickly killed the chicken before the soldiers heard them (119). 

# 11. An emigre for the first time
Arriving in London, Trotsky described the first time he met Lenin, in the autumn of 1902. It was at the crack of dawn, he continues, and Lenin's face was one of amazement when he saw Trotsky for the first time. He described the walks he would go on with Lenin around London, where Lenin would refer to the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] landmark of Westminster as, "There's *their* Westminster" (123-124). 

Trotsky tells of the time that he and Lenin went to see a play, and Trotsky badly needed new shoes. Lenin had a pair, he recounts, that were too small. However, the author continues, these shoes were also too small for Trotsky and were painful during the play, to the amusement of Lenin who had experienced the same feeling in those shoes (129). It's pretty funny to imagine these two just hanging out at a play.

# 12. The party congress and the split
Trotsky explains that [[Plekhanov]] was already entering a decline, and while he was a great theoretician, he didn't have the steel to act as a revolutionary leader like Lenin did. This was the source of his antipathy, the author continues, towards the younger members of the *Iskra* editorial board, and particularly to Trotsky, who he blocked from coming on to the *Iskra* editorial board (130). 

Introducing [[Krupskaya]], Trotsky says that her room was the hub of the editorial board - she was always sending out messages or recieving them, and there was always a smell of burnt paper in her room from the incineration of damning evidence (132). 

Trotsky recounts the comparison of [[Plekhanov]] and Lenin made by Vera Ivanova: the former was like a dog, he would grab something for a while, and then drop it later. The latter, she continues, was like a bulldog - "his is the death grip." Trotsky tells us this metaphor made Lenin very happy (133). 

Turning to his reaction to the split, Trotsky admits that he didn't understand the harsh necessity of [[democratic centralism]] yet. He explains that he viewed Lenin as splitting the board, which was sacreligious to him. This is a central factor that he attributes his unwillingness to go over to the [[Bolsheviks]] from the first day (141). He seems to have moved towards the idea that [[The party is a combat organization]] later in his life. 

Trotsky discusses Lenin's character:

> But Lenin had the nerve. All he needed was to be convinced that the older ones were incapable of assuming direct leadership of the militant organization of the proletarian vanguard in the revolution which was clearly approaching. The older ones - and they were not alone - erred in their judgement; Lenin was not merely a remarkable party worker, but a leader, a man with every fiber of his being bent on one particular end, one who finally realized that he himself was a leader after he had stood side by side with the elders and had been convinced that he was stronger and more necessary than they. In the midst of the still vague moods that were common in the group that upheld the *Iskra* banner, Lenin alone, and with finality, envisaged 'tomorrow' with all its stern tasks, its cruel conflicts, and countless victims (142).

Alternatively, discussing Martov's character, Trotsky calls [[Martov]] the most tragic figure of the revolution. He says that Martov was smart, and often had revolutionary instincts, but lacked the will to think things through to the end (142).

# 13. The return to Russia
Trotsky tells us the tale of when he found refuge from the police inside an ophthalmic hospital. He pretended to be ill, and a friendly doctor would "examine" him, always concluding he needed more bed-rest for his eyes (148). 

# 14. The year 1905
Trotsky describes the cluelessness of the Bolsheviks when Lenin was absent. He says that whenever they had to make their own calls, they did much worse than the rank-and-file of the party, both in 1905 and later in 1917 (156). 

On the other hand, Trotsky uses harsher words to describe the leader of the Mensheviks, Martov. He says that Martov found it impossible to gather his thoughts during stormy events, blaming it on one illness or another: "Martov did not know what to call his illness. But it has quite a definite name: *Menshevism*" (161).  

# 15. Trial, exile, escape
In the aftermath of the failed revolution, Trotsky explains that he and his copatriots on the Petrograd Soviet were sentenced to "enforced settlement in exile," an exile that was for life, and for which escape carried a punishment of three years hard labor (168). 

Trotsky recounts the dramatic escape he made while the convoy, guarded by secret police, was still traveling north. He says that he gained the trust of a peasant named Goat's Foot, who agreed to carry him west on his deer sled. To his dismay, he realized that his liberators were blind drunk, but had no choice but to allow them to ferry him through the night. Eventually, he recounts, he was able to get a forged passport and ride the trains to Finland where he met his wife (171-174). 

# 16. My second foreign exile: German socialism
Trotsky explains the 1910 division between [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Kautsky]] over revolutionary tactics. He says that the latter preferred a strategy of "wearing out" the class enemies rather than overthrowing them. Trotsky explains that this was a mistake, because it was not the bourgeoisie and the state's troops which were worn out, but the workers (187). 

Trotsky reserves the highest praises for Luxemburg and [[Liebknecht]]. The latter, he says, may have been theoretically under-educated and rash, but he was a true revolutionary unlike many leaders of the [[SPD]]. Because of this, he says, Liebknecht was always half-stranger to the party in [[Germany]] (188).

# 18. The beginning of the war
Trotsky explains that war and revolution both shake society out of its slumber, but unlike revolution, war strengthens the power of the state initially. However, he points out that even the [[Wars lead to temporary proletarian chauvinism|temporary chauvinism]] of war gives way to anti-government attitudes (206). 

# 19. Paris and Zimmerwald
During the early period of [[WW1]], Trotsky turns to an analysis of [[Martov]]. He argues that Martov usually had revolutionary instincts, but wavered when it came to following them. Instead, Trotsky continues, Martov would doubt himself and give in to the more passive course (216).

# 21. Through Spain
Trotsky was ferried through Spain by a police spy. He says that this man was pretty unusual, and would actually help Trotsky out in certain situations, like when a street vendor tried to over-charge him. He says that "my spy swore at the man in a rage, shook his fists threateningly at him, and even ran out of the cafe after him and kicked up such a rumpus under the windows that a crowd gathered about them" (234). 

# 22. New York
Turning to Bukharin, who he met in NYC, Trotsky analyzes that this man was the biggest fan of whoever was around him at the time. First, Trotsky says, it was him, and then later it was Zinoviev, and then Stalin (240).

# 24. In Petrograd
Trotsky recounts the scene at the train station when he arrived back in Russia, amidst revolutionary speeches and crowds of armed workers (252).

Discussing the day-to-day activities of his children, Trotsky explains how in the paralyzed city, his children were invited to the house of a rich family. He says that when politics came up, and the host argued that Lenin was a German spy, Trotsky's children got very angry. He elaborates that this rich guy later got into Stalin's Central Committee (255). 

Describing Markin, a proletarian Bolshevik, Trotsky recounts how when wine stores were being looted across the city, Markin first guarded the wine stores, and then destroyed their stock when it was apparent that it was no longer possible to do so. He did this because he sensed the danger of an attitude of drunkenness to overtake the workers of the city at the critical time in 1917 (257). 

Trotsky explains the places he would give long speeches, including "the Modern Circus." He would be brought in over the heads of the crowd, as if he was surfing at a concert. Once on stage, he continues, he would speak for hours, "out of a warm cavern of human bodies" (259).

# 26. From July to October
Trotsky explains the scene in the early July protest, when the Minister of Agriculture was seized by a crowd of furious workers and soldiers. Seeking to hold back the crowd from anger, Trotsky tried to first accompany Chernov (the minister) with his kidnappers, and then instead tried to have him released on the spot. Quoting the memoirs of a Bolshevik in attendance, we hear how Trotsky jumped in front of the car, and loudly asked if anyone was in favor of violence towards the minister. Nobody, we are told, raised their hands, and the minister was released unharmed. Of course, he says, this did not prevent the bourgeois press from declaring that Trotsky attempted to have the minister lynched (274). 

After the reaction to the July protests, Trotsky recounts Lenin's opinion on the matter - that the Bolsheviks would be picked off one by one, since the advance of the masses had been halted for the time. However, Trotsky says that Lenin gave too much credit to the state and the capitalists, who were attempting to do such a thing, but not with enough vigor (275). 

Hilariously, when the Provisional Government called for the arrest of Lenin, Kamenev, and Zinoviev, Trotsky demanded to be added to the list, arguing that he was in complete agreement with those guys (277). 

After he was arrested as a result, he tells us how his boys visited him in prison. He explains that his boys told him that they were staying with a reactionary colonel, and had actually tried to stab him with a kitchen knife when he was slandering Lenin and the Bolsheviks (278). 

Trotsky describes the atmosphere of the prison during the advance of [[Kornilov]] towards Petrograd. He says that everyone knew that Kornilov would kill all the political prisoners, but all the guards in the prisons were Bolsheviks, and were therefore ready to release Trotsky & Co. at amy moment. However, Trotsky says that he knew such an action would be the trigger for an uprising that was not yet prepared (279). 

# 27. The deciding night
Trotsky describes the mood at the Smolny, the Bolshevik HQ. He describes rooms full of cigarette smoke, ringing telephones, and leading Bolsheviks passed out on couches, unable to take the time to head home each night (283). 

Trotsky describes the atmosphere right after the seizure of power by the Military Revolutionary Committee. He says that Lenin and him laid in a bare room (287):

> We could not sleep, so we talked in low voices. Only now did Lenin become reconciled to the postponement of the uprising. His fears had been dispelled. There was a rare sincerity in his voice. He was interested in knowing all about the mixed pickets of the Red Guards, sailors, and soldiers that had been stationed everywhere. "What a wonderful sight: a worker with a rifle, side by side with a soldier, standing before a street fire!" he repeated with a deep feeling. At last the soldier and the worker had been brought together!

Trotksy cites his statement at the time, defending the uprising against accusations of coup. He argues that the masses of the people were with the Bolsheviks, and an uprising of the people needs no justification (287).

# 28. 'Trotksyism' in 1917
