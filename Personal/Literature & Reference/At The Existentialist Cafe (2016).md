# Review
This book is part biographical, part work of [[philosophy]]. It discusses the lives and ideas of those who existed in the milieu of [[Existentialism]], including [[Sartre]], [[Camus]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Heidegger]], and others. It introduced me to some new interesting people, such as Edmund Husserl, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
