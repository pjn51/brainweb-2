# 1. The revolution against Hegel
[[Engels]] begins with an analysis of what [[Hegel]] meant by "reality." Engels says that the latter thinker didn't ascribe the quality of "reality" lightly, and said that only that which is *necessary* is real. Extended, he continues, all that is real is rational to Hegel. Therefore, he continues, his ideas were *twisted* into saying that everything that exists ought to exist, and given a reactionary character that they need not posess ([[Marx and Engels - Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy (1959)]], p. 198). [[For Hegel, to be real is to be necessary]]. 

Building on the idea of reality, Engels says that all that is real, i.e. rational, is not real for all time, according to Hegel. He explains that Hegel viewed the [[France|French]] aristocracy as real, but also the French revolution that swept it away. For Hegel, he continues, all that loses its rationality, and therefore its *realness* must be swept away, and therefore there's a [[dialectics|dialectic]] of reality that Hegel uses to motivate historical change. Engels summarizes his conclusion of this dialectic: *All that is real deserves to perish* (Ibid, p. 198). 

Engels now turns to the development of thought and knowledge. He says that just as history proceeds ever upward, never arriving at a final destination, so too does the human pursuit of knowledge continually do away with the old conclusions, to be replaced by new ones which are destined to be rewritten. He says that each phase is justified in its original context, but new conditions emerge, often because of the stage itself, that remove the necessity of the old stage, which is destined to be swept away by a new one (Ibid, p. 199). He's saying that [[Evolution follows a pattern of punctuated equilibrium]], [[New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic]], [[Things change through contradiction]], and other ideas, all at once!
