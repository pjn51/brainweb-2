# Not a cadre organization
The authors allege that the cause of the 2010 split in the IMT was the failure to become a [[cadre]] organization. They argue that too many comrades place blind trust in the leadership and don't think for themselves (p.1).

# "The basic rules of democratic centralism"
The article argues that instead of having written rules, there are unwritten rules sourced from an abstract tradition, which we ought to be suspicious of from the very start, since they aren't justified (p.2). Frankly, I agree with them here. There is very little concrete material in the [[IMT Membership Handbook (2022)]] about these rules of [[democratic centralism]].

## 1. The leadership must lead. The main ideas of the organization should come from and be expressed by the leadership
This rule, the authors say, seems reasonable upon first glance. However, they argue that placing the leaders as official thinkers of the group relegates the activity of developing theoretical positions to an elite activity, whereas it should be the work of all members (p.3). I think they go too far in their phrasing of this idea, and the above is really a generous rephrasing of the claim, but I agree with the kernel at the heart of it, but I don't think the IMT has this issue, at least as far as I've seen.

## 2. The leadership must be in complete control of every aspect of the work
By attempting to keep all the reins in their hands, the authors claim, the leadership loses track of the important issues and becomes burnt out. Also, they argue, this leads to the leaders pretending that they have everything under control - even prioritizing such control over political advances for the group (p.3). I *really* don't think the IMT has this issue. It's natural for the leaders to try to influence events - that's why we have them! In a voluntary organization, there's really no way for a leadership to have 'complete control' over anything.

## 3. Discussion must be channeled through the democratically elected bodies of the organization.
The authors describe what they see as an unwritten rule of the IMT: that differences must be resolved at the highest level, with decisions passed down to the membership until a resolution is reached. They argue that such a rule 'batters' the membership until many just withold their true thoughts and back out of the discussion (p.4). I don't think this is the way that debate really happens within the IMT, or at least in my experience. I think that the opposite should really happen - debates at the branch level coalesce into proposals made at the Congresses and leadership election decisions, and that's the way that I feel like things happen (from my limited POV).

## 4. Factions are generally considered a bad thing and discouraged. The establishment of a faction has to be approved by the leadership
Of course, the article claims, it's absurd to have the leadership able to approve or deny challenges to itself by newly forming factions, and they say that this means too much time is wasted accusing each other of having secret factions (p.4). I agree that if this is the case where the EC can deny factional rights to groups, that's bad. I'm not sure what the real rules for faction formation are.

## 5. Once a vote has been taken, the discussion ends and everybody must argue for what has been decided
Throughout time, the article says, Marxists have taken lengthy periods to come to final conclusions. Because of this, we are told, it is unreasonable that at the end of one discussion, a political line can be enforced for all time. They say that forcing comrades to argue for a position that they disagree with degrades the soul of a revolutionary organization, and binding unity should be restricted to activity and not thought (p.5). I agree that [[Democratic centralism has nothing to do with groupthink]], and I think the IMT needs to clarify what decisions are binding - organizational or theoretical?

They liken this situation to a factory on strike - a strike breaker is somebody who chooses not to participate in the strike after the vote has passed, not somebody who calls for the end to the strike at a workers' meeting the next day. If we classiy the latter as inpermissable, the authors explain, we're guaranteeing splits and ending the possibility of free debate (p.5).

## 6. Discussions within the EC, CC, IEC, etc. are "confidential." Anything said in these discussions is not to be quoted outside of these bodies. Likewise with "private" discussions between individual members of these bodies and other individuals
The authors describe how this seals information away from most people, and allows for the bullying of comrades behind closed doors (p.5).

## 7. The leadership should decide what information and whose ideas reach the members
The authors argue for an 'intranet' and the open availability of email lists to allow members to communicate with one another, saying that if the leadership has real political authority the open reading of anything won't result in comrades choosing not to read the basic texts of Marxism (p.6). I think their point on free internal discussion has some merit, but like I've said elsewhere, the IMT is a voluntary organization. If a reading group wanted to discuss a postmodernist book or something, there's really nothing the leadership could do about that besides trying to politically convince the branch comrades to focus elsewhere.

## 8. Discussion should be kept within the confines of the organization
The authors explain that while we are small, our enemies pay no mind to our debates, and when we are large, all our debates will have to be public anyway. This means, to them, that allowing our internal debates to see the light of day would actually give us credibility as a living, thinking organization (p.6-7).

# From bureaucratic rules to a bureacracy and splits
The article outlines that despite full-timers not getting much money, a culture of bureaucratism can still develop based on personal prestiege and a desire not to return to the status of plain worker. The article argues that this incentivizes full-time comrades to preserve their positions, sometimes at the expense of the group (p.7).

They draw parallels to the [[Bolsheviks]], who they say also suffered from the 'committee-men,' who had to be displaced a few times during important decision points. They argue that in doing this, [[Lenin]] paid no attention to "the basic rules of democratic centralism" (p.8). I agree with that last part. A few times, Lenin went against an agreed organizational line within the party, such as going against the support of the Provisional Government, if I recall correctly. It would be important to see the method he used in doing that.

# Bourgeois vs. working class leadership
The article makes the claim that the above rules are really the same tactics that the [[bourgeoisie]] uses in management, repackaged for revolutionary politics. Instead, they argue for a different kind of leadership (p.9).

# The alternative to bureaucratization
The biggest danger, to the authors, is that we begin to decieve our own comrades and supporters by hiding the full picture. They argue that instead of stamping down disagreements, the leadership must bring them forward and debate them among the whole membership in order to politically educate the latter. The article says that we become educated through the "continuous breaking of ideas against each other" (p.10).

# From the split to a Bolshevik oragnization
The authors conclude that if the IEC disagrees with the above positions, they will seek to form a faction and fight for these demands at every level of the organization, signed by the [[Iran|Iranian]], [[Poland|Polish]], and [[Sweden|Swedish]] Executive Committees (p.11). In conclusion, I agree with a lot of their sentiments, but there aren't any concrete demands here, so I'm not sure what they intended to demand. Also, not clear that the above things are issues within the IMT from my experience.
