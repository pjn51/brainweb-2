# Preface
The authors begin by discussing how [[We're all on the hedonic treadmill]], and they propose that the way to find contentment in life is to understand yourself and your purpose (p.1). I certainly agree that [[Our goal in life should be to be content, not happy]]. I'm doubt we really have a predetermined purpose, but maybe the goal is to invent one? That's what [[Existentialism]] would say anyway.

# 1. Identifying your personality type
The authors explain that the modern interpretive system of the Enneagram is based on a "univeral insight that human beings are spiritual presences incarnated in the material world..."(p.9). This represents a foundation of [[idealism]] which I firmly disagree with. However, the system may still have some validity despite what I see as an error here. Regardless, [[I don't fully agree with the Enneagram model]]. 

Further on, the book says that while we change over our lifetime, our fundamental personality type is static (p.16). Basically, [[The Enneagram model views type as static]]. I disagree to some extent. Since personality is a result of the factors of genetics and experience, if we have intense experiences such as trauma later in life, I don't see how that wouldn't fundamentally change our personality. Of course, this isn't really a relevant fact for most people since we don't have those kinds of intense experiences, and I think that would be needed to qualitatively alter our personality. 

# 2. Ancient roots, modern insights
Turning to a history of the Enneagram, the authors outline how the symbol is ancient, but was only connected to a model of personality 

# 11. Type Five: the investigator
The authors begin an examination of this type (mine) by explaining that [[Fives' basic fear is incompetence]] and that [[Enneagram Fives seek expertise]] (p.208). 

Riso and Hudson also explain that [[Fives tend to minimize their physical needs]], seeking to avoid all distractions in their quest to become experts (p.222). I've noticed myself doing this quite a bit which is unhealthy. 

# 12. Type Six: the loyalist
The authors explain that Sixes with a Seven wing are often hesitant to speak out about themselves or their problems, and tend to distract themselves to quiet their anxieties. Continuing, the authors say that these people tend not to be overly political, but are nonetheless opinionated (p.239). 

Sixes, the book tells us, may feel that their childhood role is to fight against an overbearing mother figure, and therefore both crave and resist attention and affection (p.239). This is a common pattern: [[Sixes are contradictory]].
