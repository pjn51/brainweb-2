# 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians
Marx and Engels argue that [[All history has been history of class struggle]]. They explain that at times this struggle is open and fierce, and at other times it hides in the shadows, and that in each epoch the fight only ends with the victory of one class over another, or the "common ruin" of the contending classes (Marxist Classics v.1, p.3). This builds towards the idea that [[The future will either be socialism or barbarism]] due to the high stakes of the current class struggle. It also supports the argument that [[Marxism isn't deterministic]] - it's certainly possible that barbarism will prevail and there will not be a socialist revolution. 

Marx and Engels explain that the executive of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[state]] is a committee for managing the shared affairs of the bourgeoisie (Ibid, p.5). This idea is greatly elaborated on in [[The State and Revolution (1917)]], but we can clearly see that in the latter work, [[Lenin]] was re-establishing the intent of Marx and Engels here. 

The authors argue that the rise of the bourgeoisie has torn the old social relations apart, leaving cash payment as the sole relationship between people, and replacing the veiled exploitation of feudalism with the naked and brutal exploitation of [[capitalism]] (Ibid, p.5). This is an interesting point, and it foreshadows the internal contradictions that will eventually lead capitalism to its downfall.

Moving on to the international plane, M&E say that capitalism chases new markets all over the globe, ruthlessly drawing in all corners of the Earth towards the world market (Ibid, p.6). This is another point that would be expanded upon in [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]], and we can see here that Marx and Engels were already explaining how [[Capitalism requires expansion]]. 

Continuing a discussion of the broad effects of capitalism, the authors say that capitalism ruthlessly centralizes the means of production and the institutional power of the state (Ibid, p.7)

The authors say that the [[bourgeoisie]]... “is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.” They put forward that the growth in the factors of production outstrip the ability of the bourgeoisie to manage and control them, a crisis which expresses itself through a crisis of overproduction (Ibid, p.8). In this, we can see how [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]] in the form of the working class. We can also note how [[Social production contradicts private ownership]]. This contradiction is the result of such an outstripping, and therefore, [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. 

Marx and Engels argue that the cost of production of a worker tends towards the means of survival as the work becomes simpler and more repetitive. Therefore, they conclude that as the repulsiveness, monotony of the work increases, the wage decreases (Ibid, p.9). This involves the idea that [[Capitalism suppresses wages over time]], and the idea that [[Capitalism spurs automation]].  

Discussing events during revolutionary situations, the authors say that as the crisis intensifies, it's likely that a certain portion of the bourgeoisie will abandon their class and go over to the side of the proletariat, particularly the intelligentsia (Ibid, p.12). This reminds me of how [[Lenin argued only the intelligentsia could move the workers beyond trade union consciousness]], however Marx and Engels are not saying that here, and are only saying that the proletarian intelligentsia will have ex-bourgeois recruits.

They point out that the same weapons the bourgeoisie wielded so effectively against feudalism now come against the bourgeois themselves. They call attention to the fact that [[capitalism]] also creates the group that will wield these weapons - the [[proletariat]]. 

The authors say that the [[lumpenproletariat]] may be swept up into a revolutionary role, but is more likely to be used as a bribed tool of reaction (Ibid, p.13). I think this is one of the reasons [[Marxists orient towards the working class]]. 

They say that the proletariat play a revolutionary role because they own nothing but their own labor. Marx and Engels claim that in order to raise themselves up, the workers must cast off the upper layers of society, and cannot be easily tamed since they have little to defend or fortify. 

# 2. Proletarians and Communists
[[Marx and Engels argued for the integration of Communists into the working class]], saying that they have no interest other than the interest of the proletariat, and that they ought to always bring to the front the international character of the proletariat’s interests (Ibid, p.15). Marx and Engels say that the Communists must be the most advanced and resolute section of all working-class parties, and the section of the proletariat with the most insight and foresight into the path forward for the movement. This is a missed lesson for [[ultraleftism|ultras]], since they are the ones who tend to stand apart from the organizations of the working class and demand that the workers leave their organizations and join the sterile ones created by the sectarians.

Drawing on the lessons of [[dialectical materialism]], Marx and Engels say that the theory of the Communists doesn’t fall from the sky, it expresses the real relations springing from existing class struggle. 

The authors point out that the abolition of private property is in no way unprecedented. They say that past property relations have been continually upset by historical changes in class structure. 

They also say that [[capital]] is only created by the combined work and coordinated effort of many people, but its benefits are appropriated by a select few. Therefore, they claim [[capital]] is a social power wielded by the capitalist over the worker. Basically, [[Social production contradicts private ownership]]. They also explain that [[Capitalism suppresses wages over time]] (Ibid, p.16). 

Analyzing the domination of [[capital]] over labor, Marx argues that in capitalist society, the past (reflected in "dead labor" or capital) dominates the present (reflected by living labor) (Ibid, p.17). We can abstract this, to say that [[Under capitalism, past dominates present]]. 

Marx and Engels point out that the ability of the capitalist to possess property is only possible due to the lack of property for the majority of the population. When capitalists decry the Communists’ attempt to abolish private property, Marx and Engels reply: “...you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.” 

The authors claim that society will not cease to work after the abolition of private property. They say that if work was motivated only by gain, capitalist society wouldn’t last a day, since those who work, acquire nothing, and those who merely own acquire everything (Ibid, p.18). 

Marx briefly discusses the topic of education, saying that the communists wish to rescue it from the influence of the ruling class (Ibid, p.19). 

The authors explain that capitalism is daily reducing the differences between the lives of various nationalities, unifying the world into a global system (Ibid, p.20). This is the political consequence of how [[Capitalism requires expansion]], and it strengthens the workers' movement.

Marx and Engels reinforce the idea that [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], saying that it's not really a leap to say that we concieve of the world based on our experience (Ibid, p.20). On a larger scale, they expand this point to argue that [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]] (Ibid, p.21)

According to Marx and Engels, the proletariat, after winning political supremacy and control of [[state]], will proceed to expropriate the bourgeoisie. They say that the workers will use this [[capital]] to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible. One reason for this, as I see it, is that [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]]. 

Returning to the idea of education, Marx argues that free education ought to be combined with industrial production (Ibid, p.22). I think that Marx's ideas about education are really interesting, and I'm seeing a through-line here that I will discuss in the question "[[What did Marx say about education?]]"

The final idea in this chapter is that political power is the force that one class uses to oppress another. From this idea, Marx says that it naturally follows that after class is abolished, there will be no need for political power and its expression, the state (Ibid, p.23). 

# 3. Socialist and Communist Literature
Marx and Engels begin this section by discussing the various forms of what they call 'reactionary socialism.'

## Feudal Socialism
The authors say that because of their historical position, those at the helm of the decaying structure of [[feudalism]] were compelled to attack bourgeois society. They say that these actors tended to use socialist lingo since it offered such a valid critique of capitalism. Needless to say, Marx and Engels point out that the last gasp of the aristocracy isn't a truly revolutionary message.

The authors point out that the message of the aristocrats, "The proletariat never existed under feudalism, it's a creation of capitalism!" seems to forget that the bourgeoisie itself was borne of feudal relations. Furthermore, the authors point out that the aristocrats are really dismayed at the *revolutionary character of the proletariat,* and are perfectly fine with a class of downtrodden workers existing.

Marx and Engels also take aim at 'Christian Socialism' here. They say that nothing is easier than ascribing some kind of socialist message to Christian teaching. Despite this, they say that this ideology is nothing more than "the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat" (Ibid, p.25). By this, I think they mean that these ideas are just used to make the aristocracy feel better about its despicable actions.

## Petty-Bourgeois Socialism
The authors point out that the [[petty bourgeoisie]] is also a class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie. Because of this, they say that the individual members of the petty bourgeoisie can feel a burning anger at their precarious position on the edge of the ruling class. Since they can see a time approaching when their position will dissolve into the proletariat, the authors claim that members of this class sometimes harshly critique the bourgeoisie (Ibid, p.26). 

Marx and Engels say that this brand of socialism is excellent in its critique of existing capitalism, but falls short with its positive demands. They say that petty bourgeois socialists often just want to return to the early stages of capitalism, when small proprietors had more breathing room, or cramp the existing stage of production within the property relations of the earlier stage. In this way, Marx and Engels say that this ideology is ultimately infected by [[idealism]] and is reactionary (Ibid, p.26).

## German or "True" Socialism
Marx and Engels draw attention to the historical position of French socialists versus German thinkers. They say that the socialists in [[France]] were confronting an established bourgeoisie, while the Germans were facing a situation where a bourgeoisie had yet to conquer the feudal property relations. 

Because of the mismatch in material conditions, the authors claim that the socialist literature of [[France]] had no practical value to the German socialists. However, Marx and Engels point out that this didn't stop any German socialists from developing systems of thought around this literature. For the authors, this meant a deep detour into literary ventures and idealism. They say that the German socialists attempted to generalize conclusions created by uniquely French conditions (Ibid, p.27). 

In the end, Marx and Engels say that these socialists abandoned the class struggle, instead seeking to work from the perspective of humanity in general, just as the class struggle began in earnest in Germany (Ibid, p.28).
