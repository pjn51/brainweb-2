# The Narodniks
`TAGS:` #org 

---
a.k.a. Narodnaya Volya, they were a group in Tsarist [[Russia]], mainly following the ideas of [[Anarchism]].  See [[Bolshevism - Road to Revolution (1999)]] for an analysis of their ideas and role in the movement. 

Their rallying cry was "Go to the people!" and they thought that they could instill revolutionary [[class consciousness]] within the poor [[peasantry]] through their program of [[mutual aid]], which they referred to as "small deeds." This was ineffective, and the activists were often reported to the police by the very people they attempted to mobilize. This was because [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], not on the basis of activism. 

The Narodniks are the ideological ancestors of the [[Socialist Revolutionaries]], who would emerge later.
