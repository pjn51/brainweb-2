Scheidemann was a leading member of the [[SPD]] and Chancellor of the German government during the failed [[Germany|German revolution]]. 

On November 9th, 1918, he proclaimed the establishment of a German Republic. He had heard rumors that [[Liebknecht]] was going to proclaim the foundation of a socialist republic, and wished to head this off and redirect energy in a less threatening direction.
