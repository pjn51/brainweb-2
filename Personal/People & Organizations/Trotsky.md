Leon Trotsky was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainain]] revolutionary who fought side-by-side with [[Lenin]] in [[Russia|the October revolution]]. He later led the creation of the Red Army and the defense of the USSR during their civil war. 

When the [[Bolsheviks]] split with the [[Mensheviks]], Trotsky initially held out for a reunification of the two parties, refusing to join the Bolsheviks outright. However, when he saw that the Bolsheviks were the truly revolutionary of the two, he joined and was a big part of their success. 

After the victory of [[Stalin]] and the bureaucracy he represented, Trotsky was exiled from the [[Russia|USSR]], and eventually killed by a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] assassin in [[Mexico]]. 

His legacy inspired many others who carry the banner of [[Trotskyism]] today.

# Quotes
>Naturally, the “condition of class forces” supplies the foundation for all other political factors; but just as the foundation of a building does not reduce the importance of walls, windows, doors, roofs, so the “condition of classes” does not invalidate the importance of parties, their strategy, their leadership.
>-- [[The Class, the Party, and the Leadership (1940)]]

> The dialectic is not a magic master key for all questions. It does not replace concrete scientific analysis. But it directs this analysis along the correct road, securing it against sterile wanderings in the desert of subjectivism and scholasticism.
