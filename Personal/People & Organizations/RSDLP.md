The RSDLP was the original [[workers' party]] from which [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]] split out of. Throughout the period before the October Revolution in 1917, it was the point of reference for the working class in [[Russia]]. This meant that the fight for the leadership of this organization was important.
