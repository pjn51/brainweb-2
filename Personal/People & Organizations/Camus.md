Albert Camus is one of the most famous philisophers of the 20th century, and his relationship with [[Sartre]] became representative of the divide between the pro-Communist and anti-Communist left in Europe. 

Although Camus rejected the label of [[Existentialism]], he is still considered one of the central thinkers of that school.

# His life
He was French-Algerian, born in 1913. He died in a car crash in 1960.

# The Stranger
Camus wrote this novel in 1942, about a protagonist who feels totally detached from the rest of society. He drifts from place to place, without feeling invested whatsoever in the morals or goals that society prescribes. 

The novel begins with the lines, "Today, mother died. Or yesterday, I'm not sure." This feeling of apathy characterizes the whole of the novel, where our protagonist murders a man just to see how it would feel to kill. He is then put to death, and accepts his fate. 

# Absurdism as a philosophy
Camus' phisosophy rejected the very idea of having a philosophical system of life, but nevertheless tries to function as one. 

> There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living, that is the fundamental question of philosophy.
\- Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus

As for the question, "what is the meaning of life?", Camus asserts that this question is impossible to answer. Camus defines *the absurd* as the contradiction between our desire to answer these kinds of central questions, and the total silence of the universe's answer. 

In his idea of rebellion, Camus says that we ought to rebel against the absurdity of the universe, facing this contradiction head-on. He views our choice in this situation as binary: either to refuse to live in the present by turning to [[religion]] or ideology; or to accept that we live in an irrational, godless universe. 

# Critique of Absurdism by other philosophers
Other philiosophers have said that Absurdism isn't really a philosophy, but an anti-philosophy. 

# Camus on violence
During the beginning of WW2, he advocated [[pacifism]] and wanted [[France]] to stay out of the war. Nevertheless, he reported for military service and was turned away due to having tuberculosis. 

The question of when violence is justified was a central issue for Camus throughout his life. He mainly came down on the side of not justifying it. He opposed the death sentence for Nazi collaborators, and rejected [[Marxism]] and the idea of revolution. 

Camus said that the question of the validity of suicide was the most important question in the "age of negation", but we have now moved into the "age of ideologies", where the question of the validity of murder is at hand. 

Camus fundamentally doesn't believe that any positive change is possible whatsoever, and so therefore nothing negative is justified in pursuit of such a future. 

## Camus against Communism
Camus first split from the Communist Party of [[France]] over its Popular Front strategy of playing down French colonialism in order to win broader support from the national bourgeoisie. 

His critique of Marxism is *thouroughly* idealist, saying that the spirit of revolution inevitably leads to murder. He says that the ends do not justify the means of revolutionary change of society. 

Camus says that the attempt of [[Bolsheviks]] to "overthrow God and place man in his place" is the contemporary expression of the Western sickness that seeks to revolt against the absurdity of the universe. 

# My critique of Camus
## On violense
Camus has a failure in his idea that 'the ends do not justify the means' when it comes to violence. This is obviously an oversimplification. One must ask, what ends, and what means? Camus seems to think that nothing in pursuit of a better future justifies actions in the present which are not in themselves good or valuable. 

If we take this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, why did Camus support fighting back against the Nazis, if a world without Nazis was surely not a given. Why would anyone do *anything* unpleasant to create a better world, since that better world is not a given?

Maybe Camus would respond that one may work for a better world, but shouldn't do anything in itself evil in the pursuit of a future good. Ok, so let's explore that. Camus says that under some conditions, 'political murder' is justified. He says...
1. The target must be a tryant
2. The killing must not involve innocent civilians
3. The killer must be in direct physical proximity to the victim
4. There must be no alternative to killing

Under these conditions, were the Bolsheviks justified? The Tsar was certainly a tyrant, the Bolsheviks never intentionally killed innocent civilians to my knowledge, the Tsar was shot so (3) is met, and there was no alternative to his execution, as the White Army was closing in and would have used him as a rallying point. Therefore, the killing of the Tsar was justified. The killing of the rest of his family was more debatable.
