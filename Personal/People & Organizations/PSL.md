## 1. Introduction
The Party for Socialism and Liberation, or PSL, is a left-wing political group in the [[USA]]. They have a history of belonging to the current of [[Trotskyism]], but made a shift towards [[Stalinism]]. 

## 2. History
The PSL was founded in 2004, out of a split in the Workers World Party. 

## 3. Positions [^1]
The PSL has many stances that I would personally consider incorrect. I think they tend to bend the stick too far against [[USA|American]] [[imperialism]], and end up supporting second and third tier imperialist states.

## 3.1. Foreign policy
The PSL argues that we ought to support countries like [[Cuba]] and [[China]], in order to prevent "counterrevolution, imperialist intervention, and dismemberment." The PSL denies that the Chinese government is commiting human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and opposed the 2019 Hong Kong protests, calling them "chauvinist, separatist, and anti-China." The PSL also denies that a massacre took place at Tianenmen Square. 

Turning to [[North Korea]], the PSL also supports this country against what it deems as imperialist agression. The organization also supports Assad's efforts to retain control of [[Syria]].

## 3.2. Decolonization
The PSL wants to grant the right to self determination to POC within the [[USA]], which they deem to be internal nations.
