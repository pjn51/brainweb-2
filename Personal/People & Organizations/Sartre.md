Sartre was the father of [[Existentialism]] and one of the most famous philosophers of all time. 

He was influenced by a lot of philosophers, including [[Marx]]. However, Sartre's [[Marxism]] was always secondary to his existentialism. 

Sartre was awarded a Nobel prize in literature for his work, *The Family Idiot*, but he refused the prize and the cash reward. 

After living through the [[Germany|German]] occupation of [[France]], Sartre began to consider himself a leftist. For the rest of his life, he had a love-hate relationship with the [[PCF]], the Communist Party of France. He never joined, but he considered it the authentic voice of the French [[proletariat]]. 

He considered himself a "libertarian socialist" and was suspicious of all forms of authority. He always strove to blend Marxist analysis with humanism and existentialism, resisting what he saw as economic determinism in [[historical materialism]]. However, in my opinion, [[Marxism isn't deterministic]]. 

[[Sartre said we have radical freedom]], but [[Sartre's notion of freedom is one-sided]]. 

[[Sartre believed existence precedes essence]], and [[Sartre counterposed "bad faith" to authenticity]].
