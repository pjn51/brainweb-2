# Introduction
Fred Hampton was one of the leaders of the [[Black Panther Party]] in Chicago, who was famously assasinated by the Chicago police with assistance from the [[FBI]]. 

# Life
He was born in 1948 in Illinois, growing up in the suburbs of Chicago. He planned on becoming a lawyer in order to use legal knowledge against the police. 

He became a leader in the NAACP, assuming leadership of the local organization's youth council. 

After encountering the ideas of the [[Black Panther Party]], he quickly came aboard. He rose to a leadership position in the Chicago chapter, and negotiated a ceasefire between the rival street gangs. 

## The Rainbow Coalition
Hampton sought to create a multiracial organization of the oppressed. This group included the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Brown Berets, AIM, and the Red Guard Party. 

## FBI harassment
Hampton was under constant FBI surveillance after 1967. While the [[COINTELPRO]] efforts isolated the BPP from its allies, Hampton worked to prevent the Rainbow Coalition from disintegrating.
