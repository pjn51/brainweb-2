# Introduction 
Nicolae Ceausescu was the general secretary of the Romainan Communist Party from 1965 to 1989. He oversaw the running of the [[state]] apparatus in [[Romaina]], where his administration was responsible for the most totalitarian Eastern Bloc country. 

Initially, he gained popularity at home for standing up to the [[Russia|USSR]] and his criticism of the Soviet invasion of Czecholsovakia. 

After living standards declined sharply as a result of exporting much of Romainan production (in order to pay down massive foreign debt), the Romanian revolution of 1989 toppled his government. He and his wife fled, but were captured and executed by the military who had abandoned him.
