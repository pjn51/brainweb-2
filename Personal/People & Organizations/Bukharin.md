# Introduction
Bukharin was one of the leading figures in [[Bolsheviks]]. He tended to represent the tendency of [[ultraleftism]] within the Party before the October Revolution, but he shifted towards the right afterwards and eventually led the Right Opposition. 

[[Stalin]] and Bukharin formed an alliance in 1927 to remove [[Trotsky]], [[Kamenev]], and [[Zinoviev]] from the Party. He was himself arrested on the orders of [[Stalin]] in 1937, and executed in 1938. 

# Life
Before he was executed by Stalin, he begged for his life and made an offer:

> If my life is to be spared, I would like to request (though I would first have to discuss it with my wife) the following: that I be exiled to America. I would wage a mortal war against Trotsky, I would win over large segments of the wavering intelligentsia. You could send an expert security officer with me and, as added insurance, you could detain my wife here for six months until I have proven I am really punching Trotsky and company on the nose.

# Ideas
Before the October Revolution, Bukharin proposed that since the world was in the era of [[imperialism]], there was no need for any bourgeois demands to be part of the revolutionary platform. He included in this any call for national self determination of Russian ethnic minorities. [^1]

Through his influence in the [[Comintern]], Bukharin argued against any defense of the [[SPD]] or other [[reformism|Social Democratic]] organizations in their struggle against [[fascism]].  [^2]
