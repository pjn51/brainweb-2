---
The Second International was an international group of socialist political parties, with the center of gravity being in [[Germany]] with the [[SPD]] ([[reformism|Social Democratic]] Party of Germany). 

> The 2nd Int. was built during a period of capitalist expansion, which had a decisive effect upon its character. Using electoral methods, the member parties were able to secure significant concessions, creating a [[labor aristocracy]] in their home countries. This electoralism, combined with success going to their heads, made the leaders of these parties increasingly [[reformism|reformist]].

The Second International disintegrated during [[WW1]] and was eventually succeded by the [[Comintern]] (sometimes called the Third International) that formed after the [[Russia|Russian]] revolution of 1917. 

Despite having pledged to wage an international class struggle in the event of a bourgeois war, the leading members of the International decided to side with the national bourgeoisie of their own countries. When the SPD voted in favor of war credits in Germany, [[Lenin]] thought the news was forged. He couldn't believe that his comrades would go to such depths of betrayal of the world revolution.
