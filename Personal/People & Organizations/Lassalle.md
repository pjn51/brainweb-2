Lassalle argued that the [[state]] was independent of the classes of society, calling it an instrument of justice that socialists could use to achieve their program. In this way, he differed significantly from his contemporaries, [[Marx]] and [[Engels]], and their followers. 

[[Lassalle coined the Iron Law of Wages]]. 

[[Lassalle viewed the state as arbitrator]].
