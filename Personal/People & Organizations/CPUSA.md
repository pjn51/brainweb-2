# The Communist Party of the United States of America

---
During the early years of the [[Comintern]], this was a genuine vehicle of [[USA|American]] [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]], but it degenerated internally towards [[Stalinism]] with the [[Russia|USSR]]'s bureaucracy accelerating this process. 

Today, the CPUSA is a [[reformism|reformist]] and [[opportunism|opportunist]] organization, even advocating for communists to support [[Democratic Party]] candidates. 

However, many come to the CPUSA because of the history of the organization, and there has been productive work between [[IMT]] branches and CPUSA branches in some places.
