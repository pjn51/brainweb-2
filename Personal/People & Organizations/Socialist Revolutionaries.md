The SRs were a leftwing group in [[Russia]]. They were the ideological descendants of [[Narodniks]], in that they were an expression of [[petty bourgeoisie|petit bourgeois]] revolutionism. (See [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)#The Struggle Against Which Enemies Within the Working-Class Movement Helped Bolshevism Develop Gain Strength and Become Steeled|LWC]] for more on petty bourgeois revolutionism.) 

They had a strong base of support among the [[peasantry]], and came in first place in the elections to the Constituent Assembly in 1917 before it was abolished.
