# The Marxist Center Network

---
The Marxist Center network is a federation of socialist and communist organizations in the [[USA]]. They view themselves as an alternative to the [[sectarianism]] of the past, while refusing to go along with what they see as [[reformism]] on the [[USA|American]] left.

They favor an approach including [[mutual aid]] following the path of "base building."

Their federation is made up of a number of small organizations, including Philly Socialists and Red Union (in [[Seattle]]). 

The organization dissolved in 2021. See [this statement](https://regenerationmag.org/remarks-on-dissolution-of-marxist-center/) for the views of one of the founding members as to why this group dissolved.
