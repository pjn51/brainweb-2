Spinoza was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher of Jewish origin. One of his biggest achievements was that [[Spinoza resolved the mind-body dualism]] of [[Descartes]]. 

He was rather controversial because of his views on God. [[Spinoza viewed God as universal]], arguing that only God exists, that the entire universe is within God. However, because [[Opposites require each other]], saying that God is everything is nearly the same as saying that God is nothing. Because of this position, Spinoza was exiled from the Dutch Jewish community, and his works were banned by the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]]. 

Also, [[Spinoza was a determinist]].
