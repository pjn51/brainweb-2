---
The Democratic Socialists of America is a loose organization of leftists in the US. There is a wide spectrum of ideology within the DSA, ranging from [[reformism|reformists]] and social democrats, to democratic socialists, to [[Marxism|Marxists]]. 

## The 'Dirty Break'
The DSA has been engaging in this tactic within [[Democratic Party]], believeing that they can take a shortcut through a bourgeois party to gain influence, and later split from the Democrats when they have enough popular support. This is a confused violation of the principle of [[class independence]]. 

At least this idea still involves breaking with the Dems.

## The Ackerman Thesis
This is the real idea behind the 'dirty break'. This thesis simply calls for a party surrogate, where the party within a party would utilize the Democratic ballot line. [[The Ackerman Thesis represents class collaboration]]. 

This is a question of reform or revolution! The DSA is content with [[reformism]], whether they admit it or not. 

## The DSA and entrism
The DSA isn't doing [[entryism]] in [[Democratic Party]]. It's impossible to win over the workers within that party, because there is no real discussion happening in that party, and the Dems aren't really a mass political organization in that sense. They're more of a fundraising apparatus.
