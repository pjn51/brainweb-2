The Militant was a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] organization in the [[UK]]. For a summary of the rise and fall of the Militant, see [[How the Militant was Built - and How it was Destroyed (2005)]]. 

The Militant practiced [[entryism]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)]] for a period, and was a founding section of the [[CWI]]. 

[[The IMT emerged from a split in Militant]]. The minority around [[Ted Grant]] and [[Alan Woods]] formed what would become the [[IMT]] while the majority remained in what would later become [[SPEW]] (The Socialist Party of England and Wales), remaining in the CWI.
