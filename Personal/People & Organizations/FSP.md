# Introuduction
The Freedom Socialist Party is a [[Trotskyism|trotskyist]] group here in [[Seattle]]. 

# Ideas
They take an unprincipled stance on [[fascism]], saying that [[Trump]] is a fascist, and functionally allying with [[Democratic Party]] in order to remove him. 

They also take a different stance towards [[identity politics]]. They center the individual struggles of oppressed groups instead of the class struggle. 

I would categorize them as a [[sectarianism|sectarian]] organization (see [[What makes an organization sectarian?]])
