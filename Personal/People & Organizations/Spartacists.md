Not to be confused with [[Spartacist League]]. 

The Spartacists were a revolutionary group in [[Germany]]. Their main leaders consisted of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Liebknecht]]. 

They took an [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] stance in regard to multiple issues in 1919. They opposed the convening of a constituent assembly during the 1919 German Revolution. While [[Rosa Luxemburg]] advocated for the running of candidates in local elections, the membership voted to boycott the 'bourgeois' electoral struggle for the National Assembly in January 1919. Instead, many members said that it was the duty of the Spartacists to seize power directly, even without majority support from the [[proletariat]]. This led to their defeat in the Spartacist uprising. 

They were one of the precursor organizations to the [[KPD]].
