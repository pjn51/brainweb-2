Dave Harvey is an [[academy|academic]] from the [[USA]]. He has a very popular introductory series on [[Capital (1867)]].

As explained in [[Dave Harvey against revolution - the bankruptcy of academic Marxism (2020)]], Harvey is a downright counter-revolutionary who seems to be under the impression that a revolution would result in 80-90% of the population starving to death because of a halt to the circulation of [[capital]].
