Martov was one of the leading figures on the left-wing of [[Mensheviks]]. He sometimes appeared to be moving towards the [[Bolsheviks]], but tended to waver at the decisive moment. 

[[Trotsky]] said that Martov was one of the most tragic revolutionary figures, since the latter tended to have good revolutionary instincts and a sharp mind for [[dialectics]], but lacked the will and resolve to carry his own analysis through to the necessary conclusions [1]. 

After the [[Russia|Russian]] Civil War, Martov went to [[Germany]], where he died of natural causes in 1923.
