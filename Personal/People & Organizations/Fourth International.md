# Introduction
The Fourth International was an international group of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] political organizations. It was founded in 1938 after [[Trotsky]] declared that the [[Comintern]] was no longer a genuine revolutionary tool, and was now a puppet of [[Stalinism]]. 

There was a major split in the FI in 1940, and again in 1953.
