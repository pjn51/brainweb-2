# Introduction
Shachtman was a prominent figure in the [[SWP (USA)]], representing the [[petty bourgeoisie]] within that party. He eventually degenerated into a social democrat  and advisor to [[unions|union]] bureaucrats. 

# Life
He was born in Poland to a Jewish family, and moved to NYC in 1905. After becoming interested in [[Marxism]] in the 20s, he joined the Workers Council, which was a communist organization opposed to the strictly underground stance of the [[CPUSA]] at the time. 

After the CPUSA launched the legal Workers Party of America, Shachtman joined and rose to become an alternate member of the central committee. 

Shachtman was expelled from CPUSA along with [[James Cannon]], leaving to found *The Militant* newspaper. He was the first [[USA|American]] to visit [[Trotsky]] in exile in 1930. 

After the expulsion of Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1937, Shachtman was a founding member of the [[SWP (USA)]]. 

He broke with the SWP in 1940, after refusing to abide by the decisions of a special convention. He left, with about 40% of the SWP's membership. 

After this break, he formed a new party which eventually dissolved back into the Socialist Party, and eventually worked to push the SP to work with the [[Democratic Party]] as a policy of "realignment."

# Ideas
In 1933, he came out against the idea of Black self-determination as a transitional demand, arguing that it represented [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] currents of [[reformism]] within the movement. 

After the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, M.S. argued that the [[Fourth International]] should no longer defend its position on the uncritical defense of the [[Russia|USSR]]. 

He also argued that the USSR was pursuing a policy of [[imperialism]] in Eastern Europe. [[Shachtman proposed the theory of bureaucratic collectivism]]. 

In 1961, he refused to condemn the Bay of Pigs invasion of [[Cuba]].
