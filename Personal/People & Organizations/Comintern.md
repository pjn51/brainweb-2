The Comintern, or Communist International, was the international organization of revolutionary parties set up in the [[Russia|USSR]] to spread the movement elsewhere. At first, it provided a base of support for the generation of many good organizations, but as [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]], the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] foreign policy of the USSR replaced internationalism as the driving force in the organization. 

A tendency towards "Zinovievism" emerged, where political problems were solved by bureaucratic and organizational measures. However, [[Organizational re-arrangement cannot solve political issues]] and this only accelerated the rot as yes-men replaced revolutionary leaders. 

In this way, [[The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s]]. This can be seen in the case of [[Spain|the Spanish revolution]] particularly clearly.
