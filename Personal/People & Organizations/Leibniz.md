Woods argues that Leibniz was an objective idealist who challenged the monist views of [[Spinoza]]. Like Spinoza, Leibniz started from a conception of the unity of all substance (to him, the "monad"), but emphasized that there was an infinite variety of this single substance. He also stressed that each unique monad is a microcosm of the universe. ^1
