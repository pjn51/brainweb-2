Rosa Luxemburg was a Polish revolutionary until her death in 1919 during the failed [[Germany|German revolution]]. 

Along with [[Liebknecht]], she represented the authentic revolutionary wing of the German workers' movement, and was one of the few leaders of that movement who opposed [[WW1]] from the outset.
