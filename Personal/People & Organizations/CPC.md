The CPC is the leading group in the [[China|Chinese]] [[state|state]], and led [[China's 1949 revolution]]. To classify them as simply Maoist or Stalinist is an oversimplification, since the party developed and mutated ideologically over its long history. 

At first, its principal flaw was a lack of [[class independence]]. Later, it found a solid base in the [[peasantry]] and was able to seize power in 1949. However, it did not set up a healthy workers' democracy and immediately adopted a bureaucratic form and outlook.
