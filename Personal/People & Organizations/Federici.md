# Introduction
Silvia Federici is an academic who was born in [[Italy]]. She claims to be from the radical [[feminism|feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] tradition. I would say that she is highly infuenced by her position within the [[academy]].

Federici wrote [[Wages Against Housework (1975)]].
