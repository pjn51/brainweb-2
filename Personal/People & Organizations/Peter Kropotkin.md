# Introduction
Kropotkin, who lived from 1842 until 1921, was a Russian [[Anarchism|anarchist]] theorist. 

He was born into an aristocratic family in Moscow. However, he dropped his royal title at the age of 12, professing a belief in republicanism. Throughout his early life, he was deeply immersed in the training afforded to the aristocracy, culminating in his joining the Tsarist army after serving as a page for Tsar Alexander II. 

In the military, he served in eastern Siberia. After his military service, he went to university to study mathematics. 

After getting involved in a populist group, he was arrested by the government. Because of his social background, he was treated well and allowed to continue his studies. Just before his trial, he escaped to England. Because of this, he spent more than 40 years in exile, living for a long time in [[Switzerland]], [[France]], and England. 

In 1916, he advocated for supporting the Allies against the Central Powers, isolating him from the majority of the anarchist movement. 

He returned to [[Russia]] after the February Revolution, and was initially supportive of the October Revolution, but later became an opponent of the party's tight control over the country.
