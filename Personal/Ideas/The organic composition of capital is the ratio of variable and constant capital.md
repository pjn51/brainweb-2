*The organic composition of [[capital]] is the ratio of variable and constant capital.* If we call variable capital $v$ and constant capital $c$, we can model the [[organic composition of capital]] as:

$$
\frac{v}{c}
$$
This is often expressed as a percentage. A field of industry that requires 30% investment in machinery, raw materials, etc, and 70% investment in wages has an organic composition of 70%. 

Since [[Labor creates value]], we might expect industries with a high proportion of variable capital to be more profitable. This is cut across by the fact that [[Profit tends towards equalization across industries]].
