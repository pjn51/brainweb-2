*The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class.* The ruling class in society is in posession of the newspapers, TV stations, and media platforms. In short, they control the tools which are used to control the development culture. 

They use these tools to pursue their class interests. This is not to say that *all* media is anti-communist propaganda, only that individual capitalists and associations of capitalists tend to use their media platforms to pursue their discrete business interests. 

When the ruling class feels threatened, they will use their media apparatus to try and influence popular opinion.
