*Supply chains are becoming more complex.* We can see that as [[capitalism]] has developed, supply chains become more and more layered and involve more and more of society directly and indirectly in the production of every [[commodities|commodity]]. 

This heightens the central contradiction of capitalism: [[Social production contradicts private ownership]]. 

It also accelerates the development of [[imperialism]], since firms that employ vertical integration tend to be more profitable. This is because [[Planned economies outperform market systems]], and therefore [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]].
