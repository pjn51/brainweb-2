# I have a tendency towards passivity.
In general, I've found it easier to ignore and avoid problems than to face them head on. This is something that I'd like to improve on, since it isn't actually a good long-term life strategy. [[Problems are best approached head-on]] and [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]]. 

This has also been an issue with my friendships and relationships, because [[Relationships require active maintainance]]. 

Since [[Habits are the foundation of lifestyle]], maybe there are habits that I can develop in order to fight against this tendency.
