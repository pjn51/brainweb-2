*Profit is the ratio of surplus value ($s$) to total capital.* This total capital is divided into constant capital ($c$) and variable capital ($v$). Therefore, we can think of the rate of profit ($Rp$) mathematically:

$$
Rp = \frac{s}{v+c} 
$$

In order to determine $s$, we need to calculate the rate of surplus value, aka the rate of exploitation. [[The rate of exploitation is the ratio between surplus value and wages]].
