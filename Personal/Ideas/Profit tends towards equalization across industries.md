*Profit tends towards equalization across industries.* As a new industry emerges, it will likely have a more organic composition in terms of [[capital]]. [[The organic composition of capital is the ratio of variable and constant capital]]. This means that it may be quite profitable to invest in. Because of that, capital will flood in from outside, until comeptition and overproduction lowers the average rate of profit ([[The rate of profit tends to fall]]) [1]. 

Over time, as the average rate of profit across industries falls, capitalism begins to gain a tendency towards [[imperialism]]. This means that [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]].
