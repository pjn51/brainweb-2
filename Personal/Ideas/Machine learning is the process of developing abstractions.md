*Machine learning is the process of developing abstractions.* When we apply a [[machine learning]] algorithm to a [[data]] set, we're translating from the particular to the general, and creating a "map of meaning," one could say. 

The model then tries to apply this map to new information, and we can grade how well the model captured the patterns evident in this new information.
