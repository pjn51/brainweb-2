*During Occupy, Chomsky predicted an expanding "precariat".* In the book of his speeches and interviews, [[Occupy (2012)]], [[Chomsky]] said that there was a widening layer of Americans who were insecure in their economic position. He tied this to the financialization and de-industrialization of the [[USA]] since the 70s. 

In my opinion, there isn't much of a distinction between the [[proletariat]] and the "precariat," making this analysis a little sloppy.
