# Bolshevism requires firmness on content, flexibility on form.
We must always be providing a revolutionary [[Marxism|Marxist]] outlook and perspective, but we must be totally flexible on where we are providing this, and in what form we are delivering it. 

In [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]], [[Lenin]] discusses how "right doctrinairism" refuses to let go of the old forms of society, regardless of the content of these forms, while "left doctrinairism" totally swears off the old forms, regardless of the fact that revolutionary content may be able to surge through them. 

In order to stay on track with this, [[Never confuse content and form]]. 

This is relevant to the questions - [[How do Marxists approach workers' organizations?]] and [[How do Marxists approach oppression?]]
