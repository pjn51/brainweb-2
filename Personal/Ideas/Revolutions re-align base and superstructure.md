*Revolutions re-align base and superstructure.* The primary contradiction today is how [[Social production contradicts private ownership]]. This is the modern example of a disalignment between the needs of production and the codified methods and traditions of society. 

A revolution is the final solution to this contradiction, and [[Contradictions trend towards resolution]]. This is a theoretical reason why [[Revolutionary optimism is well-founded]]!
