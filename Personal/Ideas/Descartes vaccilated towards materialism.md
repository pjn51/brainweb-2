*Descartes vaccilated towards materialism.* [[Descartes]] was an idealist essentially, but in his writings on science he tended to veer towards a [[materialism|materialist]] perspective. 

For example, he dedicated page after page discussing the discovery of the circulation of blood. 

However, when it came to the relationship of body and mind, Descartes took refuge in mystical thinking and divine intervention. Ultimately, [[Descartes failed to explain the relation of body and mind]].
