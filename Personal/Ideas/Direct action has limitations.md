*Direct action has limitations.* I think that an element of [[direct action]] can be very useful, but not when it supplants the real goal of political action - bringing the [[proletariat|workers]] to their feet and instilling a revolutionary consciousness in them. 

Often, groups that engage in direct action do so prematurely, before it's appropriate to engage in a direct confrontation with authority. By doing this, they alientate the broader masses, who aren't ready to follow them. Because [[Movements require mass action]], any small group that alienates the broader class is doomed.
