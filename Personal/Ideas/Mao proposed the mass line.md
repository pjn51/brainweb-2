*[[Mao]] proposed the mass line.* As a part of the [[CPC]] strategy during the Long March, the Communists would edit their demands and goals based on their audience. They framed this as a way to embrace the demands of the workers and peasants, but it was really a deceptive way to gain support without elevating the consciousness of those they came into contact with. This is why [[The mass line isn't revolutionary]].
