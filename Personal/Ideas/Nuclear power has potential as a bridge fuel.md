# Nuclear power has potential as a bridge fuel. 
[[Bridge fuels could help transition towards decarbonization]], and nuclear is a good candidate. If the world were able to achieve 75% nuclearization, we could reduce global $\text{CO}_2$ emissions by 19%. 

This technology is efficient when built, and can operate at peak capacity consistently, unlike wind and solar. It also has a proven track record as a scalable system. 

However, currently [[Nuclear is expensive]] and therefore uncompetitive with other energy sources.
