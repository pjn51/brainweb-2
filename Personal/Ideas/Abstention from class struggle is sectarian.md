# Abstention from class struggle is sectarian. 
[[Trotsky]] said that a [[sectarianism|sectarian]] is an [[opportunism|opportunist]] who fears their own opportunism. Instead of wading into the messy, half-finished struggle of the [[proletariat|workers]], the sect prefers to insulate itself, creating an ideologically pure (and sterile) bubble. 

At the heart of the phenomena is the lack of a [[dialectics|dialectical]] view. [[Empiricism can lead to sectarianism]].
