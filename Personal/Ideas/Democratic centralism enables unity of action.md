# Democratic centralism enables unity of action. 
Organizations that structure themseleves using [[democratic centralism]] are able to function more efficiently since all members will follow the battle plan laid out during the [[Democratic centralism requires free debate|free discussion period]]. 

However, this is unity of *action,* not thought. [[Democratic centralism has nothing to do with groupthink]].

This unity is also important to hold the organization together, since [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]], and [[The party is a combat organization]] that must have organizational discipline.

This unity of action applies in both directions: the rank-and-file *and* the leadership must carry out the plan as agreed. In this way [[Democratic centralism establishes two-way accountability]].
