*Capitalism cannot escape crisis.* Every decade or so, capitalism enters a crisis of one sort or another. There are a few reasons for this. First of all, [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. Crises are usually related to this overproduction of goods that the working class cannot afford to purchase. 

Secondly, [[Social production contradicts private ownership]]. More and more, the anarchy of the market stands in contrast to the total organization of the firm. This mismatch makes the crises of overproduction more and more absurd. 

It is this process that causes the masses to reach revolutionary conclusions, especially under a correct leadership. [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]] . 

However, [[Capitalism has no final crisis]].
