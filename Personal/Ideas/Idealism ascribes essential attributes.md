# Idealism ascribes essential attributes. 
The position of [[idealism]] is generally that worldly phenomena are reflections of archetypes, the inverse of the argument that [[Matter, not idea, is fundamental]]. This means that they have an essential attachment to the unchanging archetype. However, in my opinion, [[Change is omnipresent]]. 

Showing a tendency towards idealism, [[The Enneagram model views type as static]].
