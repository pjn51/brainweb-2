*Good productivity routines allows for flow.* Contrary to popular belief, [[Willpower is a bad foundation for productivity]]. Instead, we should try and reduce the effort needed to stay on task and create value in our work. 

If we can set up a system that allows us to effortlessly swim through the tasks that must be done, we will be able to enter a flow state. 

In the same way that [[Note friction should be minimized]], we should minimize the friction in our productivity workflows for this reason.
