# We're all on the hedonic treadmill.
There's always something that we want. When we get this thing, for a little while, we're happy. Later, we get used to the new state of affairs, and we just want something else. Because of this, I think that [[Our goal in life should be to be content, not happy]]. The goal should be to slow down the treadmill, not get the next shiny thing faster and faster. 

This phenomenon is one reason that [[Suffering is a basic human experience]].
