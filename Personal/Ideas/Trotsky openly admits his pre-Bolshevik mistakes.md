*Trotsky openly admits his pre-Bolshevik mistakes.* Before [[Trotsky]] came over to the [[Bolsheviks]], he attempted to reunite the [[RSDLP]] in vain. Later, he fully admits that these attempts were a mistake, and represented an attempted bloc against the [[proletariat|proletarian]] wing of the RSDLP, which was the Bolshevik wing. [1]
