# Democratic centralism has nothing to do with groupthink. 
[[Democratic centralism enables unity of action]], but groups should never attempt to generate total unity of thought. Such a plan would hollow out the revolutionary soul of an organization, since [[Democratic centralism requires free debate]], and free debate means more than one perspective.

An organization that stifles a healthy range of perspectives is doomed for decline, as it will lose the ability to change course when new events present themselves. After all, [[Change is omnipresent]].

Looking at the [[Bolsheviks]], the poster child of this mode of organizing, they always had internal factions at every major decision point. The question of supporting the Provisional Government, seizing power in [[Russia's October 1917 revolution]], and beyond all were very disputed and debated.
