# Class society will be seen as human prehistory.
At some point, classes will no longer be the defining difference among humans. When that happens, the idea that [[All history has been history of class struggle]] no longer applies, and humanity will be able to move forward. 

I have no idea what will define the forward progression of humanity after class society, because [[Human consciousness is conservative]], and I don't have the ability to see what the contradictions of a post-class society would be. 

[[Marx]] supports this assertion in [[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)]].
