# Global debt has surpassed GDP.
Because [[Capitalism requires expansion]], the supply of [[currency|money]] must always be increasing, and [[Credit severs money supply from the real economy]], allowing the money supply to increase faster than the real rate of material growth.

As of 2020, global [[credit]] is at 331% of global [[GDP]].
