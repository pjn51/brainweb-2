# Choose battles carefully. 
In life, make sure that you're spending you energy on things that you actually care about. [[Volition is a finite resource]], after all. 

On the other hand, remember that [[Problems are best approached head-on]]. We need to choose battles, since [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]].
