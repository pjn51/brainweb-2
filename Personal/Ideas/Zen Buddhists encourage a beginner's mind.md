*Zen Buddhists encourage a beginner's mind.* 

> In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few.
> -- Shunryu Suzuki

In [[Zen]], practitioners are encouraged to keep a flexible awareness without relying on prior abstractions. 

While [[Abstraction is essential to human thought]] and we must develop beliefs and understanding in order to function, Zen practicioners believe that [[All classification is approximation]], and we cannot truly understand reality through abstraction. 

In this way, Zen Buddhists might have something in common with [[Kant]] and maybe Aquinas as well as Plato, all of whom thought that there was a more true reality behind our perceptions and abstractions.
