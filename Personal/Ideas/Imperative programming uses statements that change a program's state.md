# Imperative programming uses statements that change a program's state. 
This sounds confusing, but it's pretty simple. A program using this programming paradigm is engaged with via a series of commands whereby a user tells the program to do things. We describe a step-by-step approach to how a program is going to operate, rather than a description of the expected end result. 

[[Python is an imperative language]].
