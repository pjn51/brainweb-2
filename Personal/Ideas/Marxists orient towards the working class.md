*Marxists orient towards the working class.* Marxists do this for a few reasons. First of all, the proletariat is the progressive, ascendant class under capitalism in decline (and [[Capitalism is in decline]]). Second of all, [[The working class is the motor of society]]. This means that the workers have an *interest in* and an *ability to* move society past capitalism. 

This is not a moral statement on the superiority of the working class above other oppressed groups. [[Never confuse morality and strategy]].

On the other hand, [[Lenin]] pointed out the narrow-mindedness of the Economists who wanted to limit socialist activity to purely proletarian trade union struggles. He said that Marxists should be developing roots among *all oppressed layers.*
