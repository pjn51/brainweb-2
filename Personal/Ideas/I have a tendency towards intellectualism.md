# I have a tendency towards intellectualism.
I've noticed this in myself, and it is supported by my [[What is the Enneagram?]] reading of [[enneagram Fives]]. I tend to prefer observing and studying rather than being an active participant. However, [[Action verifies perception]] and there's no way for me to truly understand the world without participating in it.
