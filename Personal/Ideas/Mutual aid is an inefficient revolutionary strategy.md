*Mutual aid is an inefficient revolutionary strategy.* While the intentions of [[mutual aid]] organizers are laudable, it doesn't result in a balanced energy-in to energy-out ratio. 

One argument in support of mutual aid is that it's easier to organize and engage in politics when your basic needs are being met, particularly by those who you may want to organize with. Another argument would be that we must demonstrate that a world beyond capitalist exploitation in order to radicalize people. 

While the first argument has some merit, both suffer from the issue of substitutionalism. There simply aren't and will never be enough organizers to meaningfully fill the void of unmet human need in society. The mutual aid strategy is a recipe for burnout and collapse of organizations, no matter how good the intentions of the organizers are. 

Instead, we ought to rely on the fact that [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]], and create an apparatus for the organization and training of the new layers who are seeking to get involved. 

It's important to note that the argument against mutual aid from a Marxist perspective is not that mutual aid is *bad,* only that there is a more important role that the vanguard plays than the mutual aid organizer. Mutual aid networks will appear during the development of the class struggle, and that's a good thing. But Marxists should focus on being a transmission belt of revolutionary ideas, not charity organizers first and foremost.
