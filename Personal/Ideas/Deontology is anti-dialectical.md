# Deontology is anti-dialectical. 
Since [[Deontology proposes universal ethical rules]], I feel like this contradicts the fact that [[Nothing exists outside its context]]. We can't detach [[ethics]] from the society in which the actor exists. 

Instead, I take the view that [[Morality is historically contingent]].
