# CBT seeks to challenge cognitive distortion. 
The overall goal of [[CBT]] is to challenge and then change *cognitive distortions*. These are exaggerated or unrealistic thought patterns that lead to the perpetuation of negative mental or emotional states. 

By challenging these distortions, CBT seeks to solve specific problems that are caused by underlying mental issues. In this way, [[CBT is action-oriented]].
