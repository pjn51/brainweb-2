*Classes arise due to the needs of production.* The technological level of society and the development of the production process give rise to new opportunities for classes to emerge, in much the same way that ecological change gives rise to new niches for species to take advantage of. 

These new classes have to struggle against the old paradigm ([[All history has been history of class struggle]]). For example, feudalism gave rise to an economic situation in which there was an opportunity for merchants and investors (the [[capitalism|capitalist]] class) to emerge. However, they had to wage a political struggle against the aristocracy. For more on this concept, see...
# [[How did capitalism arise?]]

Eventually, the superstructure of [[feudalism]] ground the development of the economy to a halt, because it was limiting the [[bourgeoisie]], and a revolution was needed to clear the way. In this way, [[Revolutions re-align base and superstructure]]. 

We see the development of humanity through this process, as  [[Labor productivity reflects social process]].
