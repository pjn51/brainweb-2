*In a revolution, the masses enter the stage of history.* During normal periods, most people are content to leave the running of society to so-called experts. However, during certain special periods, the masses take their destiny into their own hands. 

This is why [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]] - the masses must understand what role they are to play if they are to really change society.

This process is only possible because [[Revolutions reflect seismic consciousness shifts]] where millions of people lose any illusions in the old way of doing things. [[The communists act as the historical memory of the working class]] to accelerate this process.
