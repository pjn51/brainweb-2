# I don't fully agree with the Enneagram model.
First of all, I think that the [[What is the Enneagram?|Enneagram]] system is deeply rooted in [[idealism]] and religious spirituality, two concepts that I firmly disagree with. However, I'm willing to engage with the system regardless because of how accurately I feel the archetype of the [[enneagram Fives|Fives]] reflects my personality. Fundamentally, I just can't get past the fact that [[Matter, not idea, is fundamental]]. 

Second, even though [[Change is omnipresent]], [[The Enneagram model views type as static]] which is a mistake in my view. I belive that personality is the result of a combination of genetics, and life experience. As we age, our flexibility may dramatically decrease in terms of personality, but major traumatic events probably have the potential to permanently alter our personalities.
