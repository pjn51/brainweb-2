*Write legible code.* When coding, it's important to keep your code usable for as long as possible. This means that your code should be legible to yourself after you've forgotten all about what you were trying to do, as well as legible to anyone else who might have to read it.

This means we should make use of doc strings as well as comments and legible variable names. 

Furthermore, [[Document your coding projects]].
