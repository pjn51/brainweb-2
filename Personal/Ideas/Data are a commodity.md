# Data are a commodity.
A [[commodities|commodity]] is something that is produced for exchange rather than for use. Therefore, despite the fact that, at first glance, it is immaterial, [[data]] are certainly a commodity.

For example, a site like Facebook harvests user data and sells it as a commodity to advertisers. This is a key pillar of their business model. 

This reinforces the fact that [[The PMC isn't a real class]], and the technology industry is full of workers, just like other industries. 

This is a way in which [[Social production contradicts private ownership]] in an increasingly insane way. The very nature of data is to be reproducible, but [[Capitalism requires scarcity]]. Therefore, artificial scarcity is imposed in the realm of data to an absurd degree.
