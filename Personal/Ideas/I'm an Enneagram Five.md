# I'm an Enneagram Five.
[[I don't fully agree with the Enneagram model]], but I think that my personality is dead-on when it comes to the [[What is the Enneagram?]] system. 

[[I have a tendency towards avoidance]] which is classic for [[enneagram Fives|Fives]], and there are multiple aspects of the archetype that I deeply relate to. [[Enneagram Fives seek expertise]] , [[Enneagram Fives fear being overwhelmed]] and  [[Fives tend to minimize their needs]]. I do all of these things. 

My full scores are as follows: 
```
 5    9    8     1     6     4     3     7     2
98%  74%  72%   69%   69%   62%   56%   48%   43%
```
