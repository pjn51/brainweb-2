# Society develops according to knowable laws. 
[[Bourgeois science refuses to analyze society]], but we can see that when we apply the theory of [[historical materialism]] that [[All history has been history of class struggle]], and thus we can understand history through an analysis of [[economics|economic]] and political forces arising from those economic ones.

Marxism argues that society progresses through a series of [[stages of historical development]].
