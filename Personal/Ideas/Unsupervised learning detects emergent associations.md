# Unsupervised learning detects emergent associations.
When we use [[unsupervised learning]], we're investigating the actual patterns within the [[data]], not merely classifying data points into buckets that we choose. 

This has some serious benefits, since [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]. 

[[ML approaches are question-specific]], so we should utilize unsupervised learning when we're searching for undetected patterns in the data.
