# Butler argues that sex is a social construct. 
In her work, *Gender Trouble,* [[Butler]] says "If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all" (GT, p.10).
