*The Constituent Assembly was unrepresentative of the Russian masses.* [[Revolutions reflect seismic consciousness shifts]], meaning that election results from even a month or two before the October revolution were totally out of step with the masses' ideas by the time the Assembly was actually formed.

If the state attempted to dissolve the Petrograd soviet, the messenger wouldn't have left alive.
