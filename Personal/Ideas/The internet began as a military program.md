# The internet began as a military program.
The internet began as ARPANET, an academic research network funded by the [[USA]] military's Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA). Later on, funding changed from the military to the National Science Foundation, still relying on state investment. The internet was fully privatized in 1994 [1]. 

While [[The internet is decentralized]] now, it is still ultimately subject to [[state]] control at the end of the day.
