*Marxists who don't organize shouldn't be taken seriously.* If these "[[Marxism|Marxists]]" took themselves and their ideas seriously, and were actually revolutionary, then their theories would translate into actions, and they would at least be involved in organizing to some capacity. 

Those who prefer lecturing and writing books to organizing tend to be [[academy|academics]]. 

This is a case of how [[Actions speak louder than words]] and how [[Thought and activity are inseperable]] in a political sense.
