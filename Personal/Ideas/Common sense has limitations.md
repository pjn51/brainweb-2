# Common sense has limitations. 
Common sense represents the heuristics that we create in order to navigate the world. These are valid within certain limits, but [[Nothing exists outside its context]]. Removed from the context in which 'common sense' was born, these heuristics become worse than useless. 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that when analyzing complex phenomena, we have to use [[dialectics]] rather than common sense because [[Change is omnipresent]] and heuristics can't account for change [1,2].
