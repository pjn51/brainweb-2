*The USSR wasn't bureaucratic collectivist.* [[Shachtman proposed the theory of bureaucratic collectivism]] but he was wrong. The [[Russia|USSR]] under [[Stalinism]] didn't represent a unique phase of society, and [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] that first transitioned away from capitalism, and then collapsed back into it quite rapidly. 

One reason for this view is that [[stages of historical development]] are necessary for the forward progress of humanity. They are not historical accidents, or things that happen only in a local context. They raise the productivity of labor, and [[Labor productivity reflects social process]]. The fact that the USSR collapsed back into capitalism demonstrates that it wasn't a valid next phase for society to enter into from capitalism.
