# Soviet workers were not slaves.
Some opponents of the [[Russia|USSR]] attempt to say that the Sovet Union was a slave society, and that the [[proletariat]] there were slaves under the control of the bureaucracy, which thinkers sometimes define as a new class. 

[[Trotsky]] argued against this, saying that the USSR had nothing essential in common with ancient Egypt. He says that while both societies used compulsion in some way, the workers of the USSR held democratic control of the economic plan, while the Pharoh controlled his slaves, and used their labor in his interests. 

Notably, the above argument only applies to the early USSR, before [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] with no democratic economic management.
