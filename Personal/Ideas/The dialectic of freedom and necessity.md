*The dialectic of freedom and necessity* refers to the tension between these two concepts, and the fact that true freedom is found when we understand what we must do, and what our real choices are.  

> Freedom is the recognition of necessity.
> -- [[Hegel]]

[[Opposites require each other]]. There can be no such thing as freedom without necessity, and vice versa. Each term is defined by the absence of the other. 

This notion stands in opposition to [[Sartre]]'s view. [[Sartre said we have radical freedom]], not taking the other side of the dialectic into account. Because of this, [[Sartre's notion of freedom is one-sided]].
