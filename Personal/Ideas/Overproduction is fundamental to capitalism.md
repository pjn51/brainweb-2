# Overproduction is  fundamental to capitalism.
Becase [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]], the [[proletariat|working class]] is unable to buy back 100% of the [[commodities]] they produce. Over time, this tension builds up until there is a collapse in the ability of capitalists to sell their commodities for a profit on the market. 

This causes an [[economics|economic]] contraction, and the [[means of production]] begin to be destroyed until the demand of the market can soak up the supply of commodities. 

This is one example of how [[Capitalism cannot escape crisis]].
