*The dialectic of cooperation and competition* refers to the complementary but opposing nature of these two instincts. Of course, [[Cooperation is fundamental to nature]]. On the other hand, rivalry can drive progress, and humans have an instinctive drive to compete with each other (at least under [[capitalism]], because [[Human nature is historically contingent]]). 

This is related to the idea that [[Rivalry has a place under socialism]], as it has a positive element. However, [[Capitalism limits cooperation]] in a very negative way.
