*Workers need their own party.* In order to participate on the political plane, workers need an organization that is only beholden to their interests. This means that the party must have [[class independence]]. 

By having such a party, the workers can experiment with methods of struggle without the confusion that arises as a result of class collaboration. Mistakes will be learned from, and [[No experience is useless]] to the workers fighting in the class struggle. 

[[The Popular Front represents class collaboration]], and is a betrayal of this policy.
