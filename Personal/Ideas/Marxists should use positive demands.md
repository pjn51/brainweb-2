*Marxists should use positive demands.* When an organization's leadership is corrupt or part of the [[labor aristocracy]], then we need to skillfully point this out without alienating the base who may still have illusions in the leadership based on their own experiences. 

In order to do this, we place positive demands on the leadership, instead of simply standing to the side and criticizing them. If the leadership gives way to these demands, we will have won a victory, and if they don't, they will expose themselves as having different interests than those of the [[proletariat|workers]]. 

For example, the plan floated by the Reform and Revolution caucus of the [[DSA]] in the event of [[Trump]] trying to steal the election was to call on the [[unions|union]] leadership to declare a general strike. We were under no illusion that the union tops would want to do this, but we call on them to do it anyway. If they don't, this will reveal to the rank-and-file that the tops are not what they say they are. 

The role of the [[Marxism|Marxists]] is to say *what is*. This means that while we call for positive demands, we also explain that we don't expect the leaders to carry these demands out. 

This is only appropriate when working within a mass organization of the working class. If there are no rank-and-file workers to win over, then what's the point?
