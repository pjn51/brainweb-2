*Woods views Platonic philosophy as a regression.* In his book, [[The History of Philosophy (2021)]], [[Alan Woods]] says that [[Plato]] introduced a cosmology tinged with [[idealism]]. 

For example, Woods says, Plato instructed his students to study the stars "as they should be" instead of starting with evidence and reality, and then moving towards generalizations from that standpoint.
