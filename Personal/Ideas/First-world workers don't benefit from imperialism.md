# First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism.
[[imperialism]], in the [[Marxism|Marxist]] sense, is the export of [[capital]], the domination of the finance sector, and the militarist expansion that ensures these processes can continue.

Some say that first-world workers benefit from lower commodity prices. However, as [[commodities]] become cheaper, wages simply decrease as the average wage needed to reproduce the laborer decreases. 

Also, the process of exporting capital has deeply undercut the leverage that the first-world working class has, and has been a big part of the decline of the [[unions|union]] movement (and thus living standards) since the 1970s. 

Because it's our job to unite the working class, and [[Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed]], Marxists must explain this perspective, along with the fact that [[White workers don't benefit from racism]]. 

This idea is one reason why [[The priviledge narriative isn't revolutionary]]. That narriative would have you think that first-world workers are somehow to blame for imperialism.
