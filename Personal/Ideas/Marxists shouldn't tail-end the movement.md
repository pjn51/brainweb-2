*Marxists shouldn't tail-end the movement.* While [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], this is not a process that automatically moves the masses towards revolutionary conclusions ([[Marxism isn't deterministic]]). [[Marxists must be where the workers are]], providing a clear analysis of the role and tasks of the [[proletariat]]. 

There are multiple dead-ends that the events of capitalist crisis can push the workers towards, and [[Marxism|Marxists]] can act as a safeguard against this potential, because [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]] which can avoid the pitfalls of the past and see the best path forward. 

[[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]] so that the workers can avoid the multiple dead ends that present themselves during the course of the class struggle. 

This concept relates to multiple questions of organizing:
# [[How do Marxists approach workers' organizations?]]
# [[How do Marxists approach oppression?]]
