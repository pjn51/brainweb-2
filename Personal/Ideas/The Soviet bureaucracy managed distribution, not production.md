# The Soviet bureaucracy managed distribution, not production. 
The bureaucrats of the [[Russia|USSR]] didn't play a role in the productive process, but rather in the distributive process. Under conditions of poverty, it was necessary to have a decider choose who would recieve what [[commodities]]. This was the new position of the bureaucrat.

This is one reason why [[Trotsky didn't define the Soviet bureaucracy as a class]] and why [[The state bureaucracy isn't a class]] in general.
