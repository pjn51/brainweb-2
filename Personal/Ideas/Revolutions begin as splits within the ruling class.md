# Revolutions begin as splits within the ruling class.
Before the [[In a revolution, the masses enter the stage of history|masses step onto the stage of history]], revolutions tend to manifest themselves as divisions in the ruling class, which finds that it is no longer to rule in the old way, and begins to be conscious of the blind alley it's trapped in. This happens first within the ruling class, since it's often more conscious than the [[proletariat]]. 

However, since [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]], there's really nothing that the ruling class can do to escape the vices that force society towards revolution. The most they can do is delay it, and channel the revolutionary energy elsewhere. One way to do this is through war, since [[Wars lead to temporary proletarian chauvinism]], or racism - [[Racism has divided the working class]].
