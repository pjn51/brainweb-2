*Marx said interest was the principle of all morality.* In [[The Holy Family ()]], [[Marx]] said that self-interest was the foundation of morality, and that therefore, we should seek to make self-interest align with the common good. 

This is further support for the idea that [[Morality is historically contingent]], and it plays into the idea that [[Marxism relies on moral assertions]].
