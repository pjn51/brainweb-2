*The party is a combat organization.* The revolutionary party isn't a debate club, nor is it a discussion group. It's meant to be a tool to focus and direct the energy of the [[proletariat]] in order to take [[state]] power and defeat the [[bourgeoisie]]. 

In order to do this, a [[Marxism|Marxist]] leadership is needed. 

[[Freedom of debate enables unity of action]], and is the most effective organizing principle here. 

Just as the bourgeois combat organizations (the police and army) train their leaders before conflict begins, [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]] after the class struggle heightens beyond the point of no-return from a confrontation.
