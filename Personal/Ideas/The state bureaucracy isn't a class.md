# The state bureaucracy isn't a class. 
The employees of the [[state]], even those with lots of power, have substantial differences from members of a ruling class. In normal periods, [[States are instruments of class domination]] where bureaucrats clearly serve the ruling class. 

However, in times where the ruling class is weak and unable to weild state power, a situation of [[Bonapartism]] can emerge. Even then, the bureaucrats are not a rulilng class. For one, historically we can see that [[The Soviet bureaucracy managed distribution, not production]], whereas a ruling class plays a role in the production process. Furthermore, classes are defined by ownership, whereas the bureaucrat cannot pass down their position.
