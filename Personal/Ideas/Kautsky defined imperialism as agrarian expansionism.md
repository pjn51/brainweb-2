# Kautsky defined imperialism as agrarian expansionism.
[[Kautsky]] is quoted as saying:

> [[imperialism]] is a product of highly developed industrial [[capitalism]]. It consists in the striving of every industrial capitalist nation to bring under its control or to annex all large areas of _agrarian_ territory, irrespective of what nations inhabit it. (_Die Neue Zeit_, 1914, 2 (B. 32), p. 909, Sept. 11, 1914; cf. 1915, 2, p. 107 et seq.)

[[Lenin criticised Kautsky's definition of imperialism]].
