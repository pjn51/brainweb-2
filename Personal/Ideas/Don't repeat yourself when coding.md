# Don't repeat yourself when coding
DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," and is a mantra that programmers should follow when writing in any [[programming language]]. 

When following this mantra, we should make good use of [[functions (python)|functions]] and [[OOP]] to allow us to write reusable code.
