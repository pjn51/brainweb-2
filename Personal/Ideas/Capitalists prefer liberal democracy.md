# Capitalists prefer liberal democracy. 
In general, the [[bourgeoisie]] favors predictability and stability above all else. For this reason, they prefer the shell of liberal democracy to guard against any sudden changes to the running of the economy. 

Only under the threat of revolution would the capitalists resort to supporting a [[fascism|fascist]] movement or any other serious destabilization of the system. 

[[Engels]] said that in liberal democracies, capitalists exert their influence "indirectly, but all the more surely"
