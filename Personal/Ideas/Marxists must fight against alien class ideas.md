# Marxists must fight against alien class ideas.
Since [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], the [[proletariat|working class]] will be surrounded with the ideas of the [[bourgeoisie]] until such time as class society is abolished. This means that [[Marxism|Marxists]], as the most conscious element of the working class, must actively fight against these ideas. 

One of these alien ideas is [[postmodernism]], and we have to guard against it because [[Postmodernism is a philosophy of despair]] that will demoralize the working class if it takes hold.
