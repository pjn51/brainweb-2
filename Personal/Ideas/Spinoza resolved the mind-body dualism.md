*Spinoza resolved the mind-body dualism.* [[Spinoza]] broke with [[Descartes]] and the idea of a barrier between mind and body, and instead said that each of these are but one attribute of a single thing, which he called the Substance. 

He gave this Substance the name of "God," dissolving God into nature and therefore providing a more-or-less atheistic outlook.
