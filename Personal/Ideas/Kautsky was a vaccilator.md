*Kautsky was a vaccilator.* Over his lifetime, [[Kautsky]] tended to veer between revolutionary and reactionary positions on things. 

[[Trotsky]] described it well when he said that when faced with a river that must be crossed, Kautsky would be the kind of person to stand on the bank and declare, "Of course, we have never denied that we must cross the river... 25 years ago we accepted the need to cross the river..." while never getting his feet wet.
