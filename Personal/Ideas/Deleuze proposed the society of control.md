# Deleuze proposed the society of control.
[[Deleuze]] said that our society is moving from a series of "disciplinary societies," an idea borrowed from [[Foucault]], towards a unified system where each atomized individual was no longer bluntly grouped with others, but was treated and managed as an individual. 

While [[Capitalism atomizes society]], and even though [[Deindustrialization has begun to disorganize some sectors of the proletariat]], I don't think this framework is a useful or accurate way to think about the world.
