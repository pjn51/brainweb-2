# Postwar "decolonization" was a mirage. 
[[The formal colonial system declined after WW2]]. However, I don't think that this contradicts the notion that [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]]. 

[[Capitalists prefer cheap government]], and the field of imperialism is no different. Why occupy a country when you can buy off the national [[bourgeoisie]] there and employ them as local overlords? 

The overt colonization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was motivated by economic competition among balanced rivals who were forced to outspend one another. When [[A unipolar world emerged after WW2]], imperialism could be purchased more cheaply through assassination, bribery, and economic sanction than through occupation.
