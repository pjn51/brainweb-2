# The dialectic of unity and dissent...
...describes how a certain level of organizational unity is needed for a productive debate to take place, and a certain level of internal dissent is needed to refresh the unity periodically, or else the unity is a false one that merely papers over widening cracks in the organization.

We can see that [[democratic centralism]] embraces this [[dialectics|dialectic]], and its [[Freedom of debate enables unity of action]].
