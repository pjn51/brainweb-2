*[[Marxism|Marxists]] must avoid substitutionalism.* [[substitutionalism]] is a process by which the Marxists take up the role of the advanced [[proletariat|workers]], and the advanced workers take up the role of the masses in the revolutionary process. 

It is a grave mistake, because it means that nobody is playing the role that the Marxists ought to be playing.[[The crisis of our era is the lack of proletarian leadership]], and it must be urgently built. If the Marxists cease to act as the leadership of the [[vanguard]], there will be nothing but trouble. 

[[Proletarian leaders become subject to alien class forces]], and if Marxists aren't consciously resisting this ([[Marxists must fight against alien class ideas]]) then an [[opportunism|opportunist]] current can develop. 

On the other hand, the leaders of the workers' movement can let victory go to their heads, and lose a sense of proportion. This can lead to [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] deviations. We can see a perfect example of this in the way that the poll tax campaign rotted [[Militant]] from the inside out, leading it on an [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] adventure out of the [[Labour Party (UK)]].
