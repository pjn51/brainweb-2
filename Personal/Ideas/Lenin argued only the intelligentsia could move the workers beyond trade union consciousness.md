# Lenin argued only the intelligentsia could move the workers beyond trade union consciousness.
In his book, [[What is to be Done (1902)]], [[Lenin]] makes the arguement that without revolutionary socialist intellectuals, the [[proletariat|workers]]' movement can only proceed along the path of least resistance, towards a bourgeois [[reformism|reformist]] trade [[unions|union]] consciousness.

He later admitted that this was a mistake, and that he overcorrected in an effort to steer the movement away from a subservience to spontaneity ([[Spontaneity has limits]]) and a lack of regard for the conscious element of the workers' movement ([[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]]).
