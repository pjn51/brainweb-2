# "Diversity of tactics" isn't revolutionary. 
Some folks, especially those in the grip of [[Anarchism]], tend to avoid creating a concrete plan of action by saying that we should embrace a diversity of tactics. 

By this, they really mean they're unwiling to settle down and make a real claim about what the movement needs most in a specific moment. 

Instead, they prefer to go with the flow, which ultimately means going with the path of least resistance.  [[Lenin]] makes the case that the path of least resistance is always going to cater to bourgeois ideology, since that is the ideology that we're all swimming around in all the time. [1]

Because of this fact, it's incredibly important that the socialist movement focus on developing concrete perspectives for each situation, and bringing a conscious element to the movement. [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]].
