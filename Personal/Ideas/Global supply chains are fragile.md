*Global supply chains are fragile.* [[Supply chains are becoming more complex]], and while this brings many benefits, it also has downsides. The specialization of different regions means that if global trade breaks down, there are fewer and fewer self-sufficient regions of the world. 

This is one way in which we can see the fractured nature of [[capitalism|capitalist]] planning ([[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]]). 

For instance, [[Rare earth elements are essential for tech manufacturing]] but  [[China dominates rare earth element production]], meaning that a disruption in global trade out of China would dramatically cripple electronics industries worldwide, practically overnight. 

Here, we can see the limitations of how [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]].
