*Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism.* [[Lenin]] thought that [[imperialism]] was an inevitable development of [[capitalism]], since there were a few forces within capitalism that inevitably brought the competitive stage towards a situation of monopoly, interventionism, and global war. However, I'm not sure if he thought it was the *next* stage, or the *final* stage. It doesn't seem very [[dialectics|dialectical]] of him to proclaim that this was the last and forever final stage. 

He defined imperialism as the dominance of finance [[capital]], and the export of capital rather than the export of [[commodities]], as well as the political processes that grew out of these economic phenomenae.
