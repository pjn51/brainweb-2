# Pre-class society was relatively egalitarian. 
Before the development of class society, there wasn't any organized oppression of one group by another. There simply wasn't the power differential to enable systemic oppression. For instance, [[Before class society, descent was matrilinear]], indicating that gender oppression wasn't systemic.

Due to this, we can say that [[All oppression is founded on class society]].
