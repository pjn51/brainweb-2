# Capitalism is in decline.
We can see that modern [[capitalism]] is no longer able to expand the means of production or raise living standards, at least in the first world. And since [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]], we can see that revolution is inevitable. 

Note that this doesn't mean [[socialism]] is inevitable. [[Marxism isn't deterministic]], and a successful social revolution is just a possibility. [[The future will either be socialism or barbarism]]. 

Because of the fact that there are no prospects for the ruling class, and [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], we can see the rise of [[postmodernism]] in today's society. [[Postmodernism is a philosophy of despair]] appropriate for such a gloomy era.
