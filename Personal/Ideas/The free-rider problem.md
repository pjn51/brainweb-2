*The free-rider problem* is a [[game theory]] concept that applies to many institutions and contexts. When some individuals are able to benefit from a shared resource without maintaining it, this disincentivizes maintainance by other members of the community. 

For example, many "right-to-work" laws have utilized this concept to weaken [[unions]]. If they can engineer a situation where workers who don't pay their union dues still benefit from the work that the union does in their workplace, they can slowly bleed the union of their support and financial stability. 

The [[How can we manage common resources?|question of managing common resources]] is tied to this concept, because it is often difficult to prevent uncooperative actors from benefiting from the maintainance of common resources.
