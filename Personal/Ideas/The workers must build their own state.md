*The workers must build their own state.* Because [[States are instruments of class domination]], the workers must seize state power from the [[How does capitalism function?|capitalists]] if they are to make a successful revolution. However, [[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that they cannot simply "lay hold of the ready-made state machinery," and must construct their own state, a [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|workers' state]] instead.

This stands in contrast to the ideas of some [[reformism|reformists]], who believe that the workers can make use of the existing [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[state]]. This is one of the main arguments that [[Lenin]] put forward in [[The State and Revolution (1917)]].
