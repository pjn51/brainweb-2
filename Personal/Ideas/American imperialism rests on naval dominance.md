# American imperialism rests on naval dominance. 
By 1943, the [[USA|American]] fleet was larger than the combined might of all other participants, and by the end of [[WW2]] the US Navy controlled 70% of the world's total tonnage of large ships, nevermind military vessels. ^1

Today, based on this dominance, the US can set the terms for any individual country's participation in the global economy. This allowed for nominal colonial independence. However, [[Postwar "decolonization" was a mirage]], with American [[capital]] extracting massive profits from exploited countries.
