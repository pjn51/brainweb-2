# The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war.
The [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] media, the state, and civil society will all attempt to divert the advanced workers and their organizations from the revolutionary road.

This highlights the need for education and consolidation at the core of organizing work. [[Lenin centered theory in revolutionary activity]] for this reason. If [[cadre]] are not firmly consolidated, they may be scared off by the intense slander of the bourgeoisie. 

This was Cannon's justification for his lack of concern over some members siding with [[Shachtman]] in the [[SWP (USA)]] split of the 40s. If these comrades caved over this, they were just going to cave later anyway.
