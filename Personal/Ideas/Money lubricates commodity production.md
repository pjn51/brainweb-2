# Money lubricates commodity production. 
The [[currency|money]] that flows through the economy enables trade between distant actors, breaking up the [[commodities|commodity]] exchange cycle in both time and space. In this way, the emergence of money provided a huge impetus for economic growth.

On the other hand, the expansion of the money supply also causes problems. [[An increase in the money supply causes inflation]], and the increasing need for money gives rise to the [[credit]] system of modern financial [[capitalism]]. 

This pressure to constantly increase the money supply is reflected in the transition away from the gold standard towards fiat currency.
