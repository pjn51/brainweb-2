# Human thought is prone to short-term overfitting.
Because of our reliance on abstractions ([[Abstraction is essential to human thought]]) and the fact that abstractions have their limits ([[Nothing exists outside its context]]), we often believe that recent patterns will continue forever, even when that isn't the case. 

For example, if someone interacts with an Albanian guy who ends up being an asshole, that person might end up creating an abstraction of "Albanians = assholes" when that isn't really the case. 

On the other hand, I suspect that [[Human thought is prone to long-term underfitting]]. 

Another way to phrase this would be that [[Human consciousness is conservative]].
