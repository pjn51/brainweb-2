# Capital flows in a M-C-M' circuit. 
The [[bourgeoisie|capitalist]] invests a certain amount of [[currency|money]] ($M$) in the production of various [[commodities]] ($C$), in the hopes of receiving a greater amount of money in the future ($M'$). 

[[The development of capitalism reversed the capital circuit]], leading to this current standard.

This is an attempt by the bourgeosie to make money out of more money, a fact that can be seen in the development of the speculative capital circuit of $M-M'$. This represents a movement towards parasitism, since [[Labor creates value]] rather than investment.
