# Mode of production and appropriation are distinct.
Under [[capitalism]], production occurs on a social basis, but appropriation is private. This leads to the central contradiction of capitalism: [[Social production contradicts private ownership]]. 

Under the transition from capitalism to [[socialism]] (the [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|dictatorship of the proletariat]]) production is social but appropriation is carried out by the [[state]]. 

Under socialism, both production and appropriation will have a social character.
