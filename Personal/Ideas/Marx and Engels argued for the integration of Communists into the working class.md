*Marx and Engels argued for the integration of Communists into the working class.* In [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]], they say that...

> The [[communism|Communists]] do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties. They have no interests separate and apart from those of the [[proletariat]] as a whole. They do not set up any [[sectarianism|sectarian]] principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.

I think this is important for answering the questions:
1. [[What makes an organization sectarian?]] 
2. [[How do Marxists approach workers' organizations?]]

This is a clear support of the idea that [[Marxists must be where the workers are]].
