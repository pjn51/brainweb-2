# China is a capitalist country. 
There are [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] who argue that [[China]] represents a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], or even a [[socialism|socialist]] society. Certainly, [[Mao set up a deformed workers' state]], but there's good evidence that China is now [[capitalism|capitalist]]. 

The CPC has been navigating towards capitalism since the reign of [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In fact, [[Deng led a Chinese counter-revolution]]. [[Marxism|Marxists]] look at things in motion, and we can see that China is *moving* towards more and more private investment. In 1995, 18% of urban workers worked for private firms. In 2018, that number increased to 87% [1].
