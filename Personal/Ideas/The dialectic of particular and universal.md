# The dialectic of particular and universal... 
... refers to the relationship between the abstractions that we generate and the particular instances of a phenomenon. [[Abstraction is essential to human thought]], but [[Matter, not idea, is fundamental]]. We are only able to construct these abstractions based on the material instances of them. 

[[Opposites require each other]] - there is no general without particular, and we can't analyze a particular thing without inventing a general to categorize it within. 

One issue with [[Queer Theory]] is that [[Queer Theory rejects the universal]], resulting in a one-sided approach.
