# Freedom of debate enables unity of action.
The revolutionary party is always going to have to be a voluntary organization. Members cannot be compelled to carry out activities except by the pressure of expulsion. That means that a high level of unity requires clarity on goals and tactics, and agreement with those factors, which can only be generated by a totally free, wide-ranging political debate at all opportunities - [[Democratic centralism requires free debate]], and because of this, [[Democratic centralism enables unity of action]].

This accords with [[The dialectic of unity and dissent]].
