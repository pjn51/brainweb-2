# The PMC isn't a real class.
The PMC, or the "professional managerial class," is a fantasy mainly created by [[workerism|workerists]] who think that the only real worker is a construction worker or factory worker. 

These folks tend to think that any white-collar, well paid worker is somehow on the side of the bourgeoisie, while in fact, these workers just make up the less exploited members of the class. 

Instead of targeting and attempting to remove them from the struggle, we should emphasize that [[Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed]], and make positive demands that the less exploited workers stand in solidarity as equals with the more exploited sections of the class. 

Instead, workerists and "PMC" theorists tend to propose that the "PMC" will never be revolutionary, and we should view these salaried workers as enemies instead of potential allies. This is why [[Workerism isn't revolutionary]].
