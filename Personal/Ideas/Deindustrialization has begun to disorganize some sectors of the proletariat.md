*Deindustrialization has begun to disorganize some sectors of the proletariat.* This is a very worrying phenomenon, particularly in [[imperialism|imperalist]] countries. As industrial [[capitalism]] seeks less organized workers, it flees the more industrialized countries like the [[USA]] and Europe. 

This presents a challenge to the workers' movement in these countries, which have to adapt to new industries and modes of domestic production. 

However, organizing a workers' movement is still possible in these countries, and [[All workers have revolutionary potential]].
