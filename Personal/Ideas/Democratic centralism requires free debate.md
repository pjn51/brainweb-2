# Democratic centralism requires free debate. 
Organizations operating under a [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]] structure must have a high degree of internal debate in order to function. In fact, the more united they seek to be in action, the more intense and wide-ranging their debate must be (see [[The dialectic of unity and dissent]]).

As a result of the conclusion of this debate, [[Democratic centralism enables unity of action]].

This debate is the only way to solve problems, since [[Organizational re-arrangement cannot solve political issues]].
