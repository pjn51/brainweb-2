*Isolation causes differentiation.* We can see this ecologically through the process of speciation ([[There are four modes of speciation]]). 

We can also see this process happen culturally with the development of language and traditions. Groups that interact with one another more frequently, will likely have more similar traditions, speech, etc, than with a group whom they seldom interact with. Of course, since [[Culture is downstream from economic basis]], the fundamental cultural institutions of two cultures that rely on similar modes of production will be relatively similar, regardless of isolation.
