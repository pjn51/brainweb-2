# Everyone has an emotional baseline.
I think that happiness is just the feeling of our mood *rising* above our *emotional baseline*. However, I think that since our mood fluctuates around this baseline, happiness is naturally impermanent and fleeting. What goes up must come down, and we eventually return to our baseline. 

For this reason, I think [[Our goal in life should be to be content, not happy]], since it isn't permanently attainable. I think a prefereble goal in life is *contentedness,* which I might define as the feeling of being satisfied with one's emotional baseline.
