# Pacifism isn't revolutionary.
Of course, the working class is naturally reistant to violence, but at a certain point in the class struggle, the [[bourgeoisie]] *will* employ violence in order to stop the progression of the workers towards power. 

When this happens, the movement is presented with a choice: either embrace [[pacifism]] and be destroyed, cast back, and ultimately lose the battle, or defend themselves. Advocating for an unprincipled peace serves the function of disarming the [[proletariat]] in the face of [[state]] and counter-revolutionary agression, and therefore plays a negative role in the class struggle. The far right and the state will never be swayed by pacifistic ideas, but some workers might be.

This isn't to say that revolutions have to be violent, to the contrary, [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]].
