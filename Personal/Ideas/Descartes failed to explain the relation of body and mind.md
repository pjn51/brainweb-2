# Descartes failed to explain the relation of body and mind.
[[Descartes vaccilated towards materialism]], but ultimately feel into [[idealism]], further reifying this false divide. This was one example of how [[Descartes vaccilated towards materialism]] and then away again. 

From a [[materialism|materialist]] perspective, [[Thought is matter that thinks]], resolving this divide. 

Later, [[Spinoza resolved the mind-body dualism]] into a monism of Substance.
