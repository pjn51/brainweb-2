*Horizontalism lacks accountability.* [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] modes of organizing often emphasize having "flat hierarchies" with no leaders or positions of authority, but these methods actually allow the leadership to avoid taking accountability. Since [[Leadership develops organically]], it's impossible to avoid certain members of an organization rising to positions of authority. If their positions of authority had names and duties, then the membership could hold them responsible for their actions, and replace them if needed. 

However, if there were no official positions of authority, the leaders can claim ignorance to their own influence within the organization, shirking any responsibility for mistakes or duties.
