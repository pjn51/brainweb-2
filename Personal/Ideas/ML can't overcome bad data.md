# ML can't overcome bad data.
No matter how powerful your [[machine learning]] algorithm is, it can't overcome shitty data. Garbage input leads to garbage output. [[Machine learning is the process of developing abstractions]], and if we develop abstractions based on incorrect assumptions or [[data]], we're going to reach incorrect conclusions and predictions.
