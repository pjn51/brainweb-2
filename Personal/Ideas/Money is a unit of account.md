# Money is a unit of account. 
[[Currency has a dual nature]]. One one hand, it exists not so much as a commodity, but as a way to measure debts and credits across society, divorced from material wealth. This is possible because [[Credit severs money supply from the real economy]]. 

When the Federal Reserve pumps billions of dollars into the financial market, they're using money in this way. 

In this way, [[Money lubricates commodity production]]. 

However, this abstract view of money can go too far. [[The gold standard was a reaction to loose monetary policy]].
