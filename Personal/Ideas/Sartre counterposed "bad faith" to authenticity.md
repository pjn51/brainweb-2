*Sartre counterposed "bad faith" to authenticity.* Fundamentally, [[Sartre said we have radical freedom]]. To him, this meant that the most important choice we had was whether to embrace this freedom or to deny it. 

He called on people to live an *authentic* life, meaning that they embrace the radical freedom they had to decide how to live their life. On the other hand, he said that a person who denied their own freedom was living in *bad faith.* 

[[Sartre]] said that this could express itself as the choice to subsume oneself within a collective identity.
