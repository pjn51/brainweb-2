*Lenin's critique of ultra-imperialism has flaws.* [[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]] but to be honest, I'm not totally convinced by parts of his argument. He says that the development of [[imperialism]] actually increases the differences between countries, but I'm not so sure about that in the long run. 

The rapid development of [[capitalism]] in the colonies does represent the evening-out of capitalist development in the long run, because it causes the development of their economies, and therefore their societies and class struggles. Of course, countries don't exist in a vaccum from one another, [[Social development is always uneven]]. That's one thing to remember.

I certainly agree with his other thesis, that once division of the world is complete, the only course forward is violent re-division.
