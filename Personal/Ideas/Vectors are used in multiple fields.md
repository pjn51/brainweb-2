*Vectors are used in multiple fields.* [[Vectors are collections of scalars]]. In [[Python]], a 1d array would be considered equivalent to a vector. Here, we can have row or column vectors. A row vector is equivalent to multiple variables of a single observation, while a column vector is the opposite, multiple observations of a single variable. 

Because [[Vectors have magnitude and direction]], in the field of physics, they are used to describe displacement, velocity, and acceleration. In computer science, vectors are just ordered lists of numbers. In math, we generalize both these views.
