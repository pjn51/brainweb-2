# Constructivism was an expression of revolutionary inspiration.
The architectural school of [[constructivism]] emerged in the [[Russia|USSR]] just after the revolution. The architects of this school faced a deep contradiction between the economic needs of the country, and their desire to express the grand vision of the future given to them by the new social landscape. 

This process reflects [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]]. As the economic base of society changed dramatically, the field of architecture was revitalized. However, the new vision was in turn constrained by the development of the economic base.
