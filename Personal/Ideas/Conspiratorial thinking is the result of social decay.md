# Conspiratorial thinking is the result of social decay.
One one hand, people still largely believe the narriative that the [[capitalism|capitalist]] class is largely working in our interests, and that our leaders are doing the same. But this fact doesn't square up with the evil deeds that people see happening all around them. 

Because they can't reconcile these facts, people begin to think there must be some sort of *secret* evil group that exists behind the scenes. 

Fundamentally, this represents a confused grasping towards a [[Marxism|Marxist]] analysis of how the world really works. It ends up tinged with the prejudices and cultural biases of society, since there is no understanding of how those prejudices are tied to the oppressive system.
