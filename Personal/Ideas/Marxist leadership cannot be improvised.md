# Marxist leadership cannot be improvised.
It is critical that [[Marxism|Marxists]] work to create a network of [[cadre]] that can win the ear of the masses during struggle. However, we cannot create this apparatus during the heat of the class struggle, we must patiently and consistently work to create it *before* the moment of truth. 

Those who want to wait until the surface of society is boiling fail to understand that [[Revolutions follow a molecular process]] and eruptions will only be visible - to casual onlookers at least - in the final stages.
