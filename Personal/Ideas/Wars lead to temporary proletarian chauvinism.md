*Wars lead to temporary proletarian chauvinism.* We can see this in the initial stages of all wars. The [[bourgeoisie]] begins using their [[media]] outlets to propagandize heavily, and the [[proletariat|working class]] can fall into the confusion of national identity. When they feel that they are under attack, their interests can be subsumed into the national interest, which of course is the interest of the capitalists. 

When it comes to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] position,[[Lenin advocated revolutionary defeatism]] during [[WW1]], and [[Trotsky]] supported a "proletarian military policy" during [[WW2]].
