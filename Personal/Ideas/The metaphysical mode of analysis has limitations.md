*The metaphysical mode of analysis has limitations.* This mode of analysis, with things viewed as independent, static components, has brought us far from the dawn of human society. It was useful as a method of accumulating data and arraying it before humanity, but this form of logic finds it impossible to put the data together again and to understand the motion of the world. One example of this is how [[The law of identity has its limitations]].

Standing on the shoulders of the metaphysical mode, [[Dialectical materialism represents the height of modern analysis]].
