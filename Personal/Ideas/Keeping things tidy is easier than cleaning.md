*Keeping things tidy is easier than cleaning.* I get a little burst of satisfaction when I see a clean kitchen, bedroom, etc. That means that by keeping things tidy and cleaning small messes often, I can maximize the satisfaction. 

On the other hand, going through the cyclical process of deep cleaning, making a huge mess, and deep cleaning again is exhausting and demoralizing, since I can only enjoy the clean environment for a short period of time after a long cleaning session, and I begin to associate cleaning with a longer session of hard work.
