*Protestantism was a bourgeois offensive.* The Protestant Reformation movement against the Catholic Church reflected the interests of the urban bourgeoisie and its attempt to dismantle the feudal strictures that prevented their growth. 

This was necessary because [[The Catholic Church was a feudal bulwark]] preventing bourgeois economic production from expanding. 

[[Engels]] discusses this in [[On Historical Materialism (1892)]].
