*Lenin advocated revolutionary defeatism.* Revolutionary defeatism was [[Lenin|Lenin's]] position on [[WW1]]. He stated that a defeat of [[Russia]] would be a lesser evil than the victory of Tsarism. This was because a defeat of Russia in the war would likely hasten revolution.

Of course, Lenin didn't put this forward in an [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] way. To outright call for the defeat of Russia would have placed him in opposition to the [[peasantry]] and most of the Russian [[proletariat]].
