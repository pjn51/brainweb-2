*Human consciousness is conservative.* When we create abstractions, we base these mental models on previous events ([[Abstraction is essential to human thought]]). That means our understanding of the world lags behind the world's actual development, and it can take a shock to jolt us forward and absorb new information that changes the way we believe the world to work. 

To put this in [[machine learning]] terminology, we could say that [[Human thought is prone to long-term underfitting]]. 

In a political sense, this reflects the fact that people are willing to put up with a lot of abuse, and it takes ground-shaking events to cause them to become conscious of the real situation. [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], and [[Revolutions reflect seismic consciousness shifts]].
