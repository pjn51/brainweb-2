*Lenin gave five basic features of imperialism.* In [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]], [[Lenin]] says that imperialism has five basic features:

1. The development of monopolies, due to the concentration of production and capital.
2. The combination of industrial and financial capital, leading to a financial oligarchy.
3. The export of capital superceding the export of commodities.
4. The formation of international monopolist associations.
5. The territorial division of the world among the imperialist powers.
