# Racism has divided the working class.
Historically, the anger and fear of white workers have been re-directed from the [[bourgeoisie]] towards non-white sections of the masses. 

However, [[Workers have natural solidarity]] that is only becoming more and more prevalent. We can see this in the [[June 2020 uprising]]. 

The ruling class has given perverse handouts to the white working class in order to divide the workers. However, just as [[Reformism is doomed during capitalist decline]], so is the racist bribery of some workers against others. As [[capitalism]] decays, workers will be united in their suffering.
