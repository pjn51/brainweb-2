# A unipolar world emerged after WW2. 
Due to the economic devastation of Europe after [[WW2]], the [[USA|United States]] was able to leverage its vast resources to become a global hegemonic power. 

This hegemony is mainly reflected in financial and naval dominance today. [[American imperialism rests on naval dominance]].

This meant that the external appearance of [[imperialism]] could vastly change, towards a path of political independence. However, [[Postwar "decolonization" was a mirage]].
