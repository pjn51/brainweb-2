*Leadership is 80% inspiration, 20% oversight.* In general, leadership (and I'm talking about political leadership here), is more focused around inspiring others than attempting to do all the work that needs to be done. [[Marxists must avoid substitutionalism]] and the burnout that comes with that sort of thing. 

As a leader, one should seek to motivate others, as well as ensure that others are carrying out their duties well, and if they are inspired and convinced of the need to do so, this shouldn't be that challenging. 

The need for inspiration is one reason that [[cadre]] must be consistently reminding others that [[Revolutionary optimism is well-founded]].
