# To balance classes, undersample, oversample, or create data. 
If we're trying to [[classification|classify]] [[data]] and we run into [[class imbalance]], we need to fix that. [[Classification requires balanced classes]].

Ideally, if we have a ton of data, we can undersample the majority class, so that the classes balance. 

If we don't have enough data, we can oversample the minority classes. 

Only as a last resort should we turn to data synthesis. One method is [[SMOTE]]. Another is [[ADASYN]].
