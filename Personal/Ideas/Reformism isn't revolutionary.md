*Reformism isn't revolutionary.* Some in the workers' movement argue that revolution is impossible, or perhaps a distant possibility in the future. They counterpose immediate reforms that they say we can implement today, or at least much sooner and easily. 

However, when we look to history, we can see that [[Reforms can be granted to undercut revolution]], and therefore, the best way to achieve reforms is to prepare for and forment revolutionary activity.

Furthermore, [[Reforms are only possible during economic upswing]] where the capitalist class can see the logic in a short-term decrease in the [[The rate of exploitation is the ratio between surplus value and wages|rate of explotiation]] in order to save the system as a whole. During a contraction, any individual capitalist will never agree to go along with the plan if their workers are not the ones revolting in any given moment. Since meaningful reforms involve a collective action of the [[bourgeoisie]], [[Reformism is doomed during capitalist decline]].
