# Democratic centralism allows for freedom of debate, unity of action.
In political organizations, there is a clear need for wide ranging debate and free discussion. On the other hand, there is also a need for the group to act as one when the time to act arises, since [[The party is a combat organization]]. This is especially important because the [[vanguard]] is usually a small organization relative to the power of the [[state]] that it seeks to challenge. [[democratic centralism]] allows for the balancing of these needs. 

This unity is also important to hold the organization together, since [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]]. 

The general process is to allow for free debate at all meetings of the organization, but hold members to the agreed-upon plan in between sessions. That means the political and organizational documents voted upon at a meeting are binding upon all members. In this way, [[Democratic centralism establishes two-way accountability]] between the rank-and-file and the leadership.

This method of organizing is superior to horizontalism, because [[Horizontalism lacks accountability]] and overall, [[Horizontalism isn't effective]].
