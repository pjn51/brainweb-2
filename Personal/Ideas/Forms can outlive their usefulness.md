# Forms can outlive their usefulness. 
Despite the fact that [[Culture is downstream from economic basis]], we ought not be mechanical about [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]]. [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], and their ideas or cultural forms can exist far longer than its economic justification, and often has to be forcibly extinguished through cataclysmic events. Furthermore, [[Human consciousness is conservative]] and needs to be jolted regardless.

For example, [[Revolutions re-align base and superstructure]], forcibly dissolving superstructural forms that are no longer progressive.
