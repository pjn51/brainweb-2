*Nothing exists outside its context.* While we must rely on abstraction ([[Abstraction is essential to human thought]]), we must also relate these abstractions back to the concrete circumstances in which they were first abstracted if we want to understand what changes to context would render these abstractions outdated. 

In a personal context, if we are around a viscious dog as a child, we will develop the abstraction that dogs are dangerous. However, if we meet another dog that shows no signs of agression, we ought not to be overly afraid. The context of that abstraction is no longer relevant, and therefore the abstraction itself no longer represents reality. 

In a political context, we see that the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] parties are the largest political power today. Therefore, we create the abstraction that this will always be the case, regardless of context. However, a [[Marxism|Marxist]] analyis demonstrates that the supremacy of the bourgeoisie is only a given within specific historical and [[economics|economic]] context, and we ought to expect changes to that context to change the class position of the bourgeoisie, and even the existence of the bourgeoisie is not an eternal fact. 

Because of this, and because [[Abstraction is essential to human thought]], I suspect that [[Human thought is prone to short-term overfitting]].
