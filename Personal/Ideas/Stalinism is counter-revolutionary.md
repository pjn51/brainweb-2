*Stalinism is counter-revolutionary.* We can see time and again, in [[Russia]], [[Spain]], and elsewhere, that [[Stalinism]] is a counter-revolutionary force that represents the interests of the Soviet bureaucracy, just as [[Stalin was a representative of the Soviet bureaucracy]]. 

[[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] partially due to Stalinism, and Stalinism arose out of the degeneration. 

One reason this tendency was so harmful was its advocacy of class collaboration and the "popular front." [[The Popular Front represents class collaboration]]. 

Another is that [[Stalinism weakened the Soviet defense in WW2]].
