*Engels defends the need for authority.* In his essay, *On Authority,* [[Engels]] says that [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] and other "anti-authoritarians" fail to see the need for authority as a part of the production process, and therefore the need for some form of authority in society. 

He gives an example of this: in a cotton mill, all the [[proletariat|workers]] must be working at the same time that the steam engine is being manned in order to produce yarn. Therefore, he explains, even if the workers are coming to all business decisions collectively, they must work together, and therefore all submit to a plan, i.e. to some form of authority.
