*Interactive learning beats lecture.* When we're trying to learn a concept or teach others, we have to actually practice going from concrete observation, to abstraction, to applied abstraction. 

This process doesn't really happen during a lecture, so interactive learning is a lot better than just dumping a lot of information on somebody. 

However, giving a lecture is highly instructive *for the lecturer.*
