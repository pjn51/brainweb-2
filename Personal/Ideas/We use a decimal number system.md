# We use a decimal number system.
The commonly understood number system is *base 10,* meaning that there are ten fundamental numbers (0 through 9).

In a massive W for [[materialism]], [[Our number system emerged due to our biology]]. 

It's cool to play with the idea that [[Alternate number systems exist]].
