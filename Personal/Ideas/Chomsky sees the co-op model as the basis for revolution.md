*Chomsky sees the co-op model as the basis for revolution.* In his book, [[Occupy (2012)]], he says...

> ...there's a scattering of hundreds, maybe thousands, of sometimes not-so-small worker/community-owned industries that could become worker-managed. And that's the basis for a real revolution. That's how it takes place. 
> -- Occupy (2012), p.35

In my opinion, this is a grave error. It's not possible to defeat [[capitalism]] on the basis of creating a new order while ignoring the old. We're firmly in the stage of [[imperialism]], and [[Imperialism renders the cooperative model uncompetitive]].
