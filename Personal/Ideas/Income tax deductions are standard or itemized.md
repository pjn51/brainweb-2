# Income tax deductions are standard or itemized. 
When filing your income taxes, there are two routes to getting [[tax writeoffs]]. On one hand, you can use the *standard deduction.* In 2021, the standard deduction for a single person was $12,550. 

Or, If you want to try your hand at getting more than that written off, you can file an itemized list of deductions.
