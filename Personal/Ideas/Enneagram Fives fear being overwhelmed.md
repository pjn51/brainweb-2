*Enneagram Fives fear being overwhelmed.* Within the [[What is the Enneagram?]] system, [[enneagram Fives|Fives]] are insecure about their ability to meet the needs of themselves and others. 

[[Enneagram Fives seek expertise]] as a coping mechanism, and also tend to withdraw from the external world and other relationships. 

This is one reason why I should remember that [[Relationships require active maintainance]], and this concept explains why [[I have a tendency towards passivity]].
