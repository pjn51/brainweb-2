# Capitalism creates revolutionaries.
The terrible things that [[capitalism]]'s laws result in are the radicalizing force in society, meaning that a central role of the [[Marxism|Marxists]] ought to be to be visible to those who are already searching for a revolutionary road out of the system. 

[[communism|Communists]] don't have to grab people by their necks and radicalize them ourselves, we simply have to patiently explain our perspectives, and clarify the beliefs of those who are already interested in our ideas. 

By patiently explaining our ideas, the workers can see our predictions come true and will come over to our side on the basis of their own experiences. [[Lenin]] talks about this in [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]]. 

This is in contrast to the [[mutual aid]] and base-building mindset, where we have to actively create anti-capitalist or post-capitalist structures that cause people to radicalize. This is one reason why [[Mutual aid is an inefficient revolutionary strategy]]. It ignores the fact that [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]].
