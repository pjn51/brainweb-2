*Necessity is expressed through accident.* While we cannot predict the exact future, we can indeed see what the historical needs of the current state of affairs are. This is a fundamental law of [[dialectics]]. 

For example, it would have been nearly impossible to predict the consequences of the murder of George Floyd, but it was trivial to predict that eventually, the Black community would react to the endless parade of police murders. 

In a way, this relationship between accident and necessity expresses how [[Opposites require each other]]. Two things that appear to be totally opposite actually deeply relate to each other.
