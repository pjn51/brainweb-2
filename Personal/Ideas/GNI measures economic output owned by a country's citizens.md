# GNI measures economic output owned by a country's citizens.
In effect, [[GNI]], or gross national income, measures the economic strength of a country's [[bourgeoisie]], including the wealth that is invested outside of the country. 

This is a common economic metric like GDP, however [[GDP measures the economic output of a given geographic area]], not the income of a given area's ruling class.
