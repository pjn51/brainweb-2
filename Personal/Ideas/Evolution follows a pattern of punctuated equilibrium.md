*Evolution follows a pattern of punctuated equilibrium.* The theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] holds that we see relatively stable states in the system, interrupted by intense periods of change. This is a more [[dialectics|dialectical]] view of [[evolution]] than thinking of it as an uninterrupted gradual change. 

[[Things change through contradiction]], and environmental systems are no exception. As one side of the contradiction begins to dominate, a tipping point is reached and the system seeks a new equilibrium. 

For example, as a pond goes through the process of eutrophication, there is a tipping point at which there is no longer enough oxygen to sustain the aerobic life, and a massive die-off begins. This is not a gradual process, but a fast one once it begins. 

[[Disturbance is an essential aspect of many ecosystems]], and is involved with the ways that ecosystems evolve.
