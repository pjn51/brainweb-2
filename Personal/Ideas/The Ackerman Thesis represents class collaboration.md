# The Ackerman Thesis represents class collaboration. 
One tendency within [[DSA]] argues that DSA should use the [[Democratic Party]] as a "surrogate party" and attempt to take it over from the inside. 

This ignores the fact that [[Workers need their own party]], and the importance of [[class independence]]. 

This thesis totally ignores the class basis of the Democrats, as well as the [[dialectics|dialectical]] way that the mood of the [[proletariat|working class]] will change. When revolutionary conditions emerge, any group that smells of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] parties will be totally ignored by the leftward-moving workers.
