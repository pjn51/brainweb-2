# Slavery requires expansion. 
Having an economy based on [[slave society|slavery]] is fundamentally unstable, since it requires an increase in the slave population in order to expand production. 

Historically, slaves don't have that many kids in captivity, meaning that expanding production requires conquering new territory and enslaving more people. 

This is the predicament the [[Rome|Roman Empire]] found itself in. Unable to expand further, its society began to break down.
