# The hell of capitalism is the firm, not the boss. 
This is one of the few things I agree with [[Bordiga]] on. Under [[capitalism]], the real issue isn't that your boss is a jerk, it's that you have a boss to begin with. Furthermore, it isn't even that you have a boss, it's that [[proletariat|workers]] are organized in private firms rather than as a part of a unified [[economic planning|planned economy]]. 

After all, [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]] no matter how nice your boss is, or how much you get paid. Even individual [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] are locked in to the system and at the end of the day have to bend to the whims of [[capital]]. 

This is why even though the ruling class will suffer as well, [[Capitalism is destroying the world]].
