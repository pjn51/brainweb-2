# Nuclear is expensive. 
Currently, nuclear construction in the [[USA]] costs around $5,400 per kilowatt of energy produced, or $5.4 billion per gigawatt. That means that to nuclearize the whole non-nuclear American grid would cost around $19 trillion, or around 90% of our annual [[GDP]]. 

This is 2.7 times as expensive as wind power per Kw, and five times as expensive as a natural gas plant to build. 

These kinds of insane costs are one reason why [[Only socialism can avert climate crisis]]. We cannot rely on market forces to make drastic investments of this scale.
