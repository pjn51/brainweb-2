*[[Lenin]] argued for revolutionary professionalism.* He and the [[Bolsheviks]] believed that the [[proletariat|proletarian]] [[vanguard]] needed a tight-knit [[cadre]] group with a high political level and theoretical training. This is why [[Lenin centered theory in revolutionary activity]]. 

I agree, and I think [[The crisis of our era is the lack of proletarian leadership]], a leadership that must be created in the same fashion that Lenin helped build the Bolsheviks. 

Such a high theoretical level is needed because [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]] and must be able to resist theoretical and material attack. Furthermore, [[Marxists must fight against alien class ideas]] in the broader workers' organizations.
