# The dialectic is a weapon. 
> When he ([[Bernstein]]) directs his keenest arrows against our dialectic system, he is really attacking... the sword that has helped the proletariat to pierce the darkeness of its future

Since [[Matter, not idea, is fundamental]], ideas are only capable of gaining a real power when they grip the minds of the masses. The [[dialectics|dialectic]] method is only a tool that can be weilded by the [[proletariat|working class]], in order to reveal a plan of attack. 

This is why it's so important that [[Marxists must fight against alien class ideas]] - they distort the historic vision of the proletariat.
