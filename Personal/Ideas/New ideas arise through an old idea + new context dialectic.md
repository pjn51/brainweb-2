# New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic.
Through the [[dialectics|dialectic]] of existing concepts and new contexts, we are forced to adapt and modify existing ideas and frameworks to a changed purpose, usefulness, and context, since  of course, [[Nothing exists outside its context]]. 

This has nothing to do with an [[idealism|idealist]] view of the universe. Ideas and concepts serve a specific material purpose and role, and as the material world changes, old ideas are no longer useful and must be adapted to new conditions.

Because of this, it's silly to insist that new ideas must come forth from thin air, without standing on ideas that have already surfaced. That means [[It's ok to be derivative]]. 

New ideas may be a slight adaptation of old narriatives, or they could be total negations of the old idea. 

This is really just a different way of saying that [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. We first develop an idea (an abstraction) out of one concrete context, and then we attempt to apply it to another situation after elaborating on it in abstraction. Then, we see where the idea is sufficient, and where it is insufficient in order to develop another idea that more accurately describes the new context.
