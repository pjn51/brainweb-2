*Socialism will increase leisure time.* Despite the fact that [[Labor will still be required after capitalism]], the amount of time that we all have to work will decrease. 

We can already see how [[Planned economies outperform market systems]], including in terms of labor productivity. This is critical, since [[Labor productivity reflects social process]]. 

The inability to increase the productivity of labor is a central reason why [[Capitalism is in decline]], and it is in this metric that socialism will advance our species. 

A combination of a higher productivity of labor and the rational planning of society will allow future generations to spend less time working and more time relaxing. 

After all, [[Laziness drives progress]]!
