*Ideas are more important to record than facts.* For [[PKM]], it's making more and more sense to me to record connections between *ideas* rather than connections between *facts.* This is because it's the ideas that stitch facts together, which I really care about and want to build upon. 

Furthermore, I find that it's a lot more *useful* to record ideas than facts, since I tend to look elsewhere for factual or technical information ([[How can I effectively organize technical info?]]). 

When recording these ideas, [[Idea notes should be atomic]].
