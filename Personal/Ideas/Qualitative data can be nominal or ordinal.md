*Qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal.* Nominal [[data]] is data that can be differentiated based only on the name of the data. Gender, car make and model, etc. We have no way to capture these things numerically. 

Ordinal data can be ranked, but is also non-numeric. A survey asking people if they like, really like, hate, or really hate something will yield ordinal data. However, we still can't relate these numerically.
