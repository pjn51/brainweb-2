# Capitalism spurs automation.
As different [[How does capitalism function?|capitalists]] compete, the technical level increases. This happens because if you can produce a [[commodities|commodity]] for lower than the average cost of production, you make a higher-than-average rate of profit. 

This changes the [[organic composition of capital]] - meaning that more and more constant capital is required to take advantage of variable capital (labor) on the higher technical level. Since [[Profit is the ratio of surplus value to total capital]] invested, [[The rate of profit tends to fall]]. 

It is this automation that sets the stage for [[socialism]], since [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]] and shorter workdays.
