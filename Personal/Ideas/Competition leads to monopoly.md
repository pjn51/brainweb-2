*Competition leads to monopoly.* [[Lenin]] proposed this idea in his book, [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]] and elsewhere.

Under early [[capitalism]], there exists free competition between many firms. Due to the successes of some firms over others, the number of competing firms diminishes over time. This process is accelerated by crisis, where smaller firms go under and larger ones are able to take the hit ([[Economic crisis accelerates concentration of capital]]). 

Over time, [[Quantity transforms into quality]], and we enter a new stage of capitalism: monopoly capitalism, or as Lenin calls it, [[imperialism]].
