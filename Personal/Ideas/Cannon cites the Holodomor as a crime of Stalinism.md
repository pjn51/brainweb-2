*Cannon cites the Holodomor as a crime of Stalinism.* In [[The Struggle for a Proletarian Party (1943)]], [[James Cannon]] reveals support for the narriative that the Holodmor was a man-made famine imposed by the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regime. 

This is interesting since a lot of socialists deny that this event happened, or at least deny the bourgeois narriative of the event.
