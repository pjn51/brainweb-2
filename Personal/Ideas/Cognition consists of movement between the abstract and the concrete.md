*Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete.* When we analyze a topic, we must first begin with the concrete - our sense perceptions of the rules that govern the object in question. 

Then, we develop abstractions out of these impressions in order to apply these same rules to other instances of the object ([[Abstraction is essential to human thought]]). 

Finally, we must move from abstract back to the concrete, applying our various abstractions to a specific instance of the phenomenon, because [[Concrete perspectives are combinined abstractions]]. 

This process is not only how we analyze patterns and phenomenae, but how we learn anything in general - by practicing this process repeatedly. 

Because it reflects an unwillingness to do this, [[Asking questions without proposing an answer is annoying]]. 

This is really just a different way of saying that [[New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic]]. We first develop an idea (an abstraction) out of one concrete context, and then we attempt to apply it to another situation after elaborating on it in abstraction. Then, we see where the idea is sufficient, and where it is insufficient in order to develop another idea that more accurately describes the new context.
