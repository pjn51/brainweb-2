# The Feynman learning technique centers summarization and explanation.
The technique is a four-step process used by [[Feynman]], the renowned physicist.

The steps are as follows:
1. Choose a concept to learn
2. Teach it to yourself or someone else, because [[Learning is collaborative]]
3. Return to the source material to fill gaps
4. Simplify explanations and create analogies, because [[Summarization requires comprehension]]
