# Commodity production creates a circuit.
Initially, [[commodities|commodity]] production can be described as a $C-M-C$ circuit, as a commodity is produced, exchanged for [[currency|money]], and then exchanged for another commodity. 

However, as the production system matures, this cycle is supplanted by a $M-C-M'$ circuit, as the emerging merchant class attempts to invest in commodity ownership only to transform it into a greater sum of money than was initially invested. However, this is a fundamentally parasitic strategy, since [[Labor creates value]], not exchange. 

Going even farther, financiers attempt to circumvent commodity investment altogether, searching for a way to turn money into more money, or $M-M'$. Profit gained through this strategy adds nothing to the wealth of society, and merely represents a redivision of existing value.
