# Colonial extraction continues today. 
Despite how [[The formal colonial system declined after WW2]], [[capital]] invested in the ex-colonial world continues to send profits towards the advanced [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries.

The advanced capitalist countries have extracted $62 trillion worth of material and labor from the underdeveloped countries, and are now extracting upwards of $2 trillion per year, all without overt occupation. ^1

This is evidence that [[Postwar "decolonization" was a mirage]], and further support's how [[Lenin defined imperialism around financial domination]] rather than military occupation.
