# The Soviet bureaucracy was compelled to defend central planning. 
Despite its [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] nature, the bureaucracy in the [[Russia|USSR]] was compelled to defend the gains made by the October revolution. This was why [[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]] despite the mis-leadership that it was operating under. In this way, [[Workers' states are contradictory]]. 

This is one reason why [[The USSR wasn't state capitalist]].
