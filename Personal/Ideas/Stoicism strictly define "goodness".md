*Stoicism strictly define "goodness".* They define things to be truly good if they are beneficial under *all* contexts. Therefore, a lot of things that we thing about as good are not good in the eyes of [[Stoicism]]. 

For example, Stoics would say that fame is not an absolute good, since it might make your life somewhat worse under some circumstances. 

This ties in with their understanding of [[virtue ethics]], because the things that Stoics say are truly good are qualities like wisdom, bravery, etc. 

Things that are neither good nor bad are called *indifferents* by the Stoics.
