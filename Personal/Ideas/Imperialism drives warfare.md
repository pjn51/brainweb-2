# Imperialism drives warfare. 
While [[imperialism]] is fundamentally driven by [[economics]], it drives political and military developments. 

In order to secure colonial markets, imperialists are compelled to fight each other for the spoils. This was the driving factor in [[WW1]] and [[WW2]], as well as many other conflicts.

[[Kautsky]] actually thought that imperialism would stop threatening peace. [[Kautsky proposed the theory of ultra-imperialism]].

Due to [[A unipolar world emerged after WW2|American hegemony]], we've seen imperialism retreat from the political sphere somewhat, but that won't always be true.
