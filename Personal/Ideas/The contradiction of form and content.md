*The contradiction of form and content* describes the relationship between these two factors. For example, a chicken requires an egg in order to develop before birth. The content (the chicken) is initially protected by the form (the egg), but at a certain tipping point, the developing content is no longer aided by the form, and the contradiction between the two heightens until its resolution (and [[Contradictions trend towards resolution]]).  

In fact, this contradiction is quite common and can be observed in any situation where organic growth requires the shedding of inflexible structures.
