*Matter, not idea, is fundamental.* [[The material world exists]], and this existence is independent of our ideas about it. This is the position of [[materialism]] as opposed to [[idealism]]. 

[[Marx asserts that existence determines consciousness]], and I agree.

Our ideas about the world are merely an successive approximation of this material reality, i.e. [[Thought and activity are inseperable]].
