*Social revolution doesn't require much violence.* Since [[The working class is the motor of society]], all the seizure of power really requires is that the [[proletariat|workers]] realize their own interests, and gain the courage to take the necessary steps. Because of this fact, [[Marxists seek to increase the clarity and confidence of the workers]]. 

To be clear, [[Pacifism isn't revolutionary]], and self-defense will be needed. The [[bourgeoisie]] *will* attempt to fight back with violence, and these attacks need to be refuted and plans to resist need to be pre-empted.
