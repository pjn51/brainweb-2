*Never confuse morality and strategy.* While [[Marxism relies on moral assertions]], [[Marxism|Marxists]] ought not to operate from a perspective of morality at all times. 

In matters of tactics and strategy, we must operate from the perspective that in order to accomplish our deeply moral task, we must do what is necessary in the class struggle. Those who make all decisions based on moral sentiment often falter. 

For example, if we were to choose to take up a certain slogan at a given moment in the class struggle, we wouldn't do so based on the *correctness* of the slogan alone. There are thousands of correct slogans, so we would make a *tactical* decision rather than a moral one. 

This is the reason that [[Marxists orient towards the working class]] instead of the lumpenproletariat. We choose to organize the class within society that has the [[economics|economic]] and social leverage to actually change society. This isn't because we're morally against the [[lumpenproletariat]], who are even more oppressed than the [[proletariat|working class]].
