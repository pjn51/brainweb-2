# Primitive accumulation separated producers from means of production. 
In order for [[capital]] to be created, the means of production of society, namely land, had to be wrested from the producers. This was accomplished through the expropriation of whole communities, an incredibly violent affair. For instance, the Enclosure Acts in the [[UK]] privatized massive common lands. 

Compared to this, [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]].
