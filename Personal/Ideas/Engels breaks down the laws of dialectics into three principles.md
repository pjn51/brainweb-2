# Engels breaks down the laws of dialectics into three principles.
In [[Dialectics of Nature (1883)]], [[Engels]] says that the three key principles of dialectics are:

1. The law of the transformation of quantity into quality ([[Quantity transforms into quality]])
2. The law of the interpenetration of opposites ([[Opposites require each other]])
3. The law of the [[negation of the negation]], which I think about as [[Effect becomes cause]].
