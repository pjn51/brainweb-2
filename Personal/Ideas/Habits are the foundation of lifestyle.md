# Habits are the foundation of lifestyle.
Our lives are made up of millions of unconscious decisions, and by having good [[habit|habits]], we can reprogram those unconscious choices over time so that they align with our long-term goals instead of our short-term ones. This is important because [[Long term and short term goals often contradict]]. 

This reflects how [[Quantity transforms into quality]]. As individual workouts pile up, eventually a qualitative shift occurs and you realize that you're now physically fit. When [[James Clear describes a "plateau of latent potential"]], he's referring to this phenomenon. 

This is one reason we should [[Prefer systems to goals]] - systems build habits.
