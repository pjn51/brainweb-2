*Human nature is historically contingent.* Under [[feudalism]], most people would have believed that it's simply "human nature" for some to rule and others to obey. They would have thought that everyone was perfectly adapted to a static position within a granite caste society. 

Today under [[capitalism]], the economic and social conditions of society create a whole new, but no less self-aggrandizing, human nature. Now, the natural human is one who out-competes their fellow humans, working harder in order to provide for their immediate families. Such a person would be considered downright deviant in feudal society. 

In the same way, [[Morality is historically contingent]].
