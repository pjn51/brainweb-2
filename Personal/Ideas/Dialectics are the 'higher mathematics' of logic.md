*Dialectics are the 'higher mathematics' of logic.* [[Trotsky]] said something like this in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]]. It deals with change in the same way that [[calculus]] does. And in the same way that the rules of calculus don't erase the rules of simple algebra, the laws of dialectics don't invalidate the laws of formal logic, they just provide tools that can work even when we reach the limitations of formal logic.
