*Woods describes Hume as a subjective idealist.* In [[The History of Philosophy (2021)]], [[Alan Woods]] says that [[Hume]]'s ideas represented [[empiricism]] turned inside out. 

Empiricism started with the notion that all knowledge arrives via our senses, and ended up with Hume, who said absolutely nothing could be really learned via the senses. 

Woods argues that just as they claim nothing can be learned via experience, nothing indeed can be learned from such thinkers.
