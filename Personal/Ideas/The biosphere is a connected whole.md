*The biosphere is a connected whole.* At all levels of scale, life on earth is described by a complex inter-relationship of systems influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. 

When it comes to these systems changing, [[Evolution follows a pattern of punctuated equilibrium]]. 

Some systems respond to change before others do. For example, [[Some species are bio-indicators]]. 

No section of this network can be separated from any other section, meaning that [[There is no wilderness]].
