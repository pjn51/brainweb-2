# Aristotle put forward three basic laws of formal logic.
[[Aristotle]] said that...

1. $A=A$ (the law of identity). This is saying that something is the same as itself.
2. $A \neq !A$ (the law of contradiction). This says the inverse, that something does not equal not-itself. 
3. $A \neq B$ (the law of the excluded middle). This says that something isn't the same as a different thing. 

However, we can see that the second and third law really stem from the first, and that [[The law of identity is the foundation of formal logic]].
