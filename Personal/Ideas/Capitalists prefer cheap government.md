# Capitalists prefer cheap government. 
It's true that [[States are instruments of class domination]], but it's also true that [[bourgeoisie|capitalists]] hate spending money on that kind of overhead.

This is one reason that [[fascism]] is the last resort of a beseiged [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], and the factor that allowed for post-[[WW2]] "decolonization," even given that [[Postwar "decolonization" was a mirage]].
