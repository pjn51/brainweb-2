# Effect becomes cause.
Formal logic proposes static categories for cause and effect, but dialectical reasoning moves beyond this static framework, and allows for the fact that once an effect has appeared, it becomes the cause of further secondary effects, and so on. 

In this, we can see how [[Dialectics are the 'higher mathematics' of logic]], in that the logical format of "cause --> effect" is still true, but it is insufficient to capture a changing world.
