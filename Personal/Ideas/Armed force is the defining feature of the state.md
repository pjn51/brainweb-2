# Armed force is the defining feature of the state.
The single feature of the [[state]], if we were to take away all others, is the police and courts system that protects the relations of production. This armed force is needed because [[States are instruments of class domination]]. 

Because they ignore or deny this feature, [[Anarchists misunderstand the state]]. 

Because armed force will still be needed to defend the revolution during a transitional period, [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]], i.e. a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]].
