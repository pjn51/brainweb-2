# Labor creates value.
This is the central idea at the heart of the [[labor theory of value]]. Notably, [[Marxism|Marxists]] don't claim that labor is the *only* source of value. However, it is the source of value that we have the largest ability to modify and expand. Because of that, [[Labor productivity reflects social process]]. 

Because the full value of this labor cannot be paid under [[capitalism]], [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]].
