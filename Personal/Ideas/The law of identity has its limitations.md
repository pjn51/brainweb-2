*The law of identity has its limitations.* In formal logic, the law of identity is "A" = "A" and this law is the basis for all of formal logic. 

Under normal circumstances, this law holds true. It doesn't tell us much, but it is true nonetheless. However, as the world changes, this law runs up against issues. [[Quantity transforms into quality]], and small changes to "A" eventually add up, and now "A" is more like "B!"

In fact, the very idea of "A" always refers to an abstraction, which is based on multiple real examples which are not perfectly identical. A pound of sugar is not equal to the next pound of sugar, and there are no two things that are really perfectly identitcal.

[[Abstraction is essential to human thought]], and we are forced to classify things in order to make sense of the world, and that's where "A" comes from in the first place.
