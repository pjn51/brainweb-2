*Social production contradicts private ownership.* Humanity engages in [[economics|economic]] production as a collective enterprise, with all industries relying on all other industries in order to produce. However, this exists in contradiction with the mode of appropriation of the surplus value that these industries produce. 

When [[surplus value]] is produced, it is appropriated by a [[capitalism|capitalist]] who uses it for his or her own ends. 

This fundamental incompatibility is one reason that [[Capitalism cannot escape crisis]].
