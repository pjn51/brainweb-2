*Thought and activity are inseperable.* This is the method by which [[Marxism]] overcomes the dualism between contemplation and activity proposed by Feuerbach. [[Marx]] supports this idea within [[Theses on Feuerbach (1845)]]. 

One reason for their inseperability is that [[Action verifies perception]] and we can't really come to any conclusions without moving between perception (thought) and activity.
