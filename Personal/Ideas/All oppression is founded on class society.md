# All oppression is founded on class society.
In order for one section of the population to be turned against another, there must be a system of private property that one section can be excluded from, and a force that is capable of doing the excluding.

> If a white man wants to lynch me, that's his problem. If he's got the power to lynch me, that's my problem. Racism is not a question of attitude; it's a question of power. Racism gets its power from capitalism. Thus, if you're anti-racist, whether you know it or not, you must be anti-capitalist. The power for racism, the power for sexism, comes from capitalism, not an attitude.
> - Stokley Carmichael

This extends not only to [[capitalism]], but to all forms of class society. We can see that [[Pre-class society was relatively egalitarian]]. 

Because of this, we can see that the only way to do away with oppression is to do away with class society.
