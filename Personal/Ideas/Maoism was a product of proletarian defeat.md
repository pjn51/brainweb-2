# Maoism was a product of proletarian defeat. 
In the aftermath of [[China's 1927 revolution]], the [[CPC]] was totally isolated from the [[China|Chinese]] [[proletariat|workers]]. Forced to flee to the countryside, they turned to the [[peasantry]] and began to theorize ways to lead the peasants to a revolution, [[Mao]] being one of the leading theorists in this. These theories coalesced into [[Maoism]].
