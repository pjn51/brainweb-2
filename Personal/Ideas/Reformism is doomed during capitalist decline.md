*Reformism is doomed during capitalist decline.* Because [[Reforms are only possible during economic upswing]], attempts at persuing a reformist electoral strategy are doomed to failure. And because [[Capitalism is in decline]], that means that we're unlikely to see a real reformist current in the workers' movement for long. 

This doesn't mean that we won't see a reformist current *attempt* to form, because [[Marxism isn't deterministic]] and we accept that individuals can attempt to swim against the current for a certain amount of time. 

This is one of the reasons that I think [[Revolutionary optimism is well-founded]], as there is little chance of a massive reformist current diverting the energy of the workers away from revolutionary conclusions.
