*To learn, elaborate and summarize.* In order to really learn a concept, we need to be able to extend it over multiple contexts (elaborate on the concept), as well as distill the idea down to its fundamental abstraction (summarize the concept). 

Ahrens argues that this is the must supported method of learning, and says that his workflow allows for this process. [1]

This makes sense when we consider that [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. When we summarize, we move from the concrete to the abstract, and when we elaborate, we move from the abstract to the concrete. 

This can also be seen as the kernel of the Feynman method: [[The Feynman learning technique centers summarization and explanation]].
