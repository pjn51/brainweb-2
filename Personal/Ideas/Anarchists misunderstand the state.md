*Anarchists misunderstand the state.* They claim that their aim is to abolish [[state]] power, but in all the places where [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] movements have succeeded in their goals, they're forced to establish an armed apparatus to protect their gains. Since [[Armed force is the defining feature of the state]], there's really no substance to their claims that they have abolished the state. 

The only real difference when it comes to the state between Marxists and Anarchists is that the latter denies that it's wielding the state, and therefore often wavers or makes mistakes when using state power. Anarchists deny that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]].
