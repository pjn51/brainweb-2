*Internationalism is essential to the workers' movement.* The workers' movement in one country will inevitably run into limitations that can only be surpassed by the solidarity of the international [[proletariat]]. 

The only reason that the Russian [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]] was able to survive was the intervention of the European working class in the reactionary invasion of the [[Russia|USSR]]. 

For this reason, [["Socialism in one country" is a lie]].
