*Emotions can't be ignored forever.* When you fail to process and address feelings, especially negative ones, they will end up resurfacing later in a more explosive way. 

I need to remember this since [[I have a tendency towards avoidance]]. That avoidance applies to my internal emotional life as well, where I find it easier to supress and bury my feelings instead of deal with them in the open.
