# The sum of many indepenent, random values tends towards a normal distribution. 
This is the central idea of the [[central limit theorem]]. For example, if we roll many die and chart the values, we will begin to see a [[normal distribution]] form. This is why [[statistics|statistical]] techniques can be applied to real data, even when individual varibles aren't normally distributed.
