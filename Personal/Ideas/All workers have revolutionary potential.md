# All workers have revolutionary potential.
Some say that workers in countries like the [[USA]] don't have any revolutionary potential, but they're wrong.

While it is a challenge to adapt to new conditions, and [[Deindustrialization has begun to disorganize some sectors of the proletariat]], we must bring forward a simple message: [[White workers don't benefit from racism]], and [[First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism]].

If we can bring this message to the [[proletariat]], then we can overcome the regional challenges and build international solidarity.
