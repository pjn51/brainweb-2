# Postmodernism questions all nariatives. 
Seeking to "deconstruct" grand narriatives about the progress of history, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] end up questioning the ability of humans to understand the world around us. In my opinion, they don't really provide any alternatives to the narriatives they question, and furthermore, they suppose their own narriative of "all narriatives are false." This is why I think [[Postmodernism is a philosophy of despair]].
