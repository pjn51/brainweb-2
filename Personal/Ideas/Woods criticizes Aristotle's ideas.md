*Woods criticizes Aristotle's ideas.* While [[Woods views Platonic philosophy as a regression]] that was overcome by [[Aristotle]], [[Alan Woods]] still critiques what he views as the [[idealism|idealist]] and mystical side of Aristotle's thought. 

He says that the idea of a First Cause, an initial impulse that set the universe in motion, is subject to the same attacks that Aristotle himself leveled against [[Plato]]. He asks how an unmoving universe could generate movement at all. 

Woods also disagrees with Aristotle's view of the development of natural life. He says that Aristotle, upon dissecting over 50 species, came to the conclusion that since all were perfectly suited for their environments, they must have developed according to some natural plan. Woods prefers the theory of [[evolution]] developed by [[Darwin]] based on the same information.
