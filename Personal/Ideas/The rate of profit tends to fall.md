# The rate of profit tends to fall.
As [[capital]] is invested in production, capitalists began to undercut one another on price and develop new innovations to do so. They seek to reduce labor-time needed to produce their commodities. This is because [[Value is detemined by socially average labor-time]]. If a capitalist can come in under that average, they will make super-profits. However, this only last until the others catch on to the innovation, and the socially average labor time for that commodity decreases. 

On an industrial scale, [[Profit tends towards equalization across industries]].

Additionally, the need for constant capital increases due to all the technical innovations. This changes the organic composition of capital. [[The organic composition of capital is the ratio of variable and constant capital]]. This further leads towards monopoly and decreased profit, since more and more constant capital is required to take advantage of the variable capital.
