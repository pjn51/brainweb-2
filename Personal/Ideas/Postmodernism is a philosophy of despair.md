*Postmodernism is a philosophy of despair.* In an epoch of [[capitalism|capitalist]] decline ([[Capitalism is in decline]]), the philosophy of the ruling class can no longer provide a vison of a positive future. Because of this, we are fed a philosophy that attempts to argue against *any* kind of progress or change. 

Because [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], this is the narriative that we see coming out of the major universities and publications. [[Marxists must fight against alien class ideas]], and [[postmodernism]] is the chief enemy coming out of the [[academy]] today. 

Due to their inability to provide any concrete analysis of the world, postmodernists prefer asking vague questions to providing any answers. [[Asking questions without proposing an answer is annoying]].
