# The first step in pottery is centering.
When we prepare to throw something on a pottery wheel, we must first center the clay perfectly on the wheel. We do this by pushing the clay up, by constricting the base, and then pushing it down. When we push it down, we use our hands to gradually center the clay. We know it's centered when we don't feel it push or vibrate against our hands as the wheel spins.

We must be careful not to break the seal the clay has with the wheel, which is why we do this in a slow and gradual way.
