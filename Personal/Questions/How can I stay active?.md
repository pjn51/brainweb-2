*How can I stay active?* I think that having an active life is very important. Even aside from the standard benefits, [[I have a tendency towards intellectualism]] which should be balanced out by a physical practice. 

I've made attempts here and there to establish a [[exercise]] routine, which should be maintained. 

I've also gotten interested in martial arts, and I have to decide between [[Aikido]] and [[Jiu Jitsu]]. I really like Aikido, which is $130 monthly, but I think BJJ is more of a workout and more challenging to me. That costs $100 a month. I *could* do both for a cost of $230 monthly, which would be about 5% of my income. I should just do one month of Aikido and then a month of Jiu Jitsu and then decide.
