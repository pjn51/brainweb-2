This is important to understand, because we live under [[capitalism]], and need to understand its laws if we wish to predict events.

Capitalism is one of the [[stages of historical development]], and is the current stage for the vast majority of humanity. It is characterised by the private ownership of the [[means of production]] and land. 

# [[How did capitalism arise?]]

The [[labor theory of value]] explains that [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]] and results in the creation of [[surplus value]]. 

Today, [[Capitalism is in decline]]. 

Related to this question is the question of economic crisis.
