# Why is the climate warming?
In order to understand why the climate is warming, we have to understand the difference between weather and climate. [[Climate is average weather]]. 

We also need  an accurate model of the climate if we want to understand the general trends in its development.
# [[How can we model climate?]]

Once we grasp the forces that affect climate, we can understand that the climate is warming due to the greenhouse effect. [[The greenhouse effect increases Earth's temperature]]. 

Because we're dramatically increasing the prevalence of greenhouse gases, we can say that [[Climate change is anthropogenic]].
