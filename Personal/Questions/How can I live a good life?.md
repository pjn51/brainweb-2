# How can I live a good life?
This is one of the most fundamental questions that one can think about, and it really exists at the place philosophy meets our daily lives. 

I think that first of all, this is a question of goals. [[Our goal in life should be to be content, not happy]], because [[Everyone has an emotional baseline]] and [[We're all on the hedonic treadmill]]. It is also a question of habits, leading me to ask, 
# [[How should I manage tasks and habits?]]

I think that despite its limitations, [[Stoicism]] is a useful school of thought for this kind of stuff. 

I think that staying active is an essential part of a good life, especially for me, since [[I have a tendency towards intellectualism]]. I also want to become more well-rounded in general. 
# [[How can I understand myself?]]
# [[How can I stay active?]]
# [[How can I become more well rounded?]]

Since I have [[Crohn's disease]], health is a priority in my life, even more so than for other people. 
# [[How can I manage Crohn's?]]

Unfortunately, we still live under [[capitalism]]. That means I have to provide for myself and for loved ones. 
# [[How can I be financially stable?]]
