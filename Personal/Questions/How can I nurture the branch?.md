# How can I nurture the branch?
As of March 2021, we have eight comrades in the SEA [[IMT]] branch. That means I can't realistically meet with all of them regularly. The fundemental task is to build [[cadre]], so I should probably focus my energy on people like Josh and Chris who are the closest to cadre. I would say John is close politically, but his schedule prevents him taking on any more work. 

Fundamentally, this question could be rephrased as: *Should I build on our strong points or reinforce the weak ones?* I think that I should build on the strong points, because [[Marxists must avoid substitutionalism]] and it's not the leadership's role to do the work of the rank-and-file branch members. 

Generally, [[Leadership is 80% inspiration, 20% oversight]]. 

For my thoughts on specific comrades, see the [[SEA-IMT roster]].
