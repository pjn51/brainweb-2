# How should I manage tasks and habits?
I think this is an important question because [[Habits are the foundation of lifestyle]]. It's especially critical for me, because [[I have a tendency towards passivity]], which strong habits help fight against. 

[[Prefer systems to goals]]. Having a clear system for organizing my habits and tasks is a really good thing, and it can help me stay consistent even when my willpower is fading. 

I've been using Todoist as my task manager, but I tend to assign too many daily tasks and inevitably ignore my todo list. The solution to this was to exclude tasks that I'm supposed to do every day, and just use Todoist as a way to manage non-habitual tasks. 

[[Some things work better in a physical format]], so I've made physical reminders to meditate and exercise. 

I think a lot of the ideas about habits suffer from an absence of the [[dialectics|dialectic]] method.
