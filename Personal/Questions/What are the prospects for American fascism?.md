# What are the prospects for American fascism?
Not great, to say the least. Since [[Fascism has a petty bourgeois base]], the strength of the [[petty bourgeoisie]] is an essential factor for a successful [[fascism|fascist]] movement. 

However, [[The American petty bourgeoisie is tiny]] and a fascist movement cannot hope to ride their anger to power.

Therefore, a successful fascist movement in the United States is very unlikely.
