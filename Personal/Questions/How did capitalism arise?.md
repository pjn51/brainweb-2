# How did capitalism arise?
Capitalism arose out of [[feudalism]], as the emergent [[bourgeoisie]] spurred the [[peasantry]] and the emergent [[proletariat]] to overthrow the monarchical systems in Europe. The capitalist class were much more inclined to re-invest their [[capital]] into increased production, dramatically increasing the development of the [[means of production]].
