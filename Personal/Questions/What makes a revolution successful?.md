# What makes a revolution successful?
This is a very important question for [[Marxism|Marxists]], since it defines our role. [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]] so that the revolutionary class is aware of its role and its fundamental tasks. 

This is important, because [[A revolution is all-or-nothing]]: the revolutionary class - and more importantly, its leadership - cannot vaccilate in the critical moment, or else they risk losing the initiative to counter-revolution.
