# What is the Marxist position on reforms?
[[Marxism|Marxists]] say that [[Reformism isn't revolutionary]]. However, do Marxists awow [[reformism|reforms]] altogether? Certainly not. [[Marxists seek to increase the clarity and confidence of the workers]], and confidence can only be gained by successfully fighting for and gaining reforms from the [[How does capitalism function?|capitalists]]. 

Marxists merely point out that [[Reforms have limits]], and the fact that [[Reformism is doomed during capitalist decline]].
