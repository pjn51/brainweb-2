# What is the state?
The [[state]] is one of the most visible symptoms of the development of society. When analyzing the state, we can see that [[Armed force is the defining feature of the state]], and that [[States are instruments of class domination]]. 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] believe that [[The state cannot be done away with overnight]], and that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]].  This means that the [[proletariat]] must establish a [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|workers' state]]. They argue that [[Anarchists misunderstand the state]] for this reason. 
# [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?]]

However, [[Workers' states are contradictory]], and the first [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]]. 
# [[What happened to the USSR?]]
