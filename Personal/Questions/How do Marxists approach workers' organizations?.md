*How do Marxists approach workers' organizations?* It's essential that [[Marxists must be where the workers are]]. That means we must engage with the organizations that the workers act through, especially since [[Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis]]. This idea is supported by historical Marxists: [[Marx and Engels argued for the integration of Communists into the working class]]. 

This often means that Marxists must operate in organizations that are run by [[reformism|reformists]] and [[opportunism|opportunists]]. This is because [[Institutional leadership reflects the prior period's mood]], as well as the fact that [[Proletarian leaders become subject to alien class forces]] regardless of their initial radicalism. 

Within these organizations, [[Marxists should use positive demands]] to call on the leadership to take progressive action. By doing this, we can expose the leaders without lecturing the membership, or alienating those who hold illusions in the leadership. 

It's important to note that the [[Democratic Party]] is *not* a [[mass organizations|mass organization]], it represents the [[bourgeoisie]]. [[American workers have no party]].
