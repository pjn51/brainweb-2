# How can we estimate likelihood?
This is the fundamental question of [[probability]]. It's an important question to think hard about, since [[Humans are bad at probability]]. 

This is particularly important when dealing with *randomness.* When estimating the likely outcome of a random process, we can take advantage of the fact that [[Repetition can make randomness predictable]].
