*What is Marxism?* There are various answers to this question. Of course, you could say that Marxism is the political theory established in the wake of [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] in the 1800s, carried forth by Lenin, etc. 

[[Lenin]] says that essentially, a [[Marxism|Marxist]] is someone who not only favors [[socialism]] or [[communism]], but someone who accepts that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]] [1].

Lenin also says that there are three component parts of Marxism, which he defines as "German philosophy, English political economy, and French socialism" [2]. I translate this concept to philisophical, economic, and strategic spheres.
# [[What is dialectical materialism?]]
# [[What is Marxist economic theory?]]
# [[What role do Marxists play?]]

We would be remiss to not include the field of [[historical materialism]]. 
# [[How does society develop?]]

It's also interesting to think about the intersections between these three parts. Marxist philosophy underpins the other two by providing an analytical tool in the form of [[dialectical materialism]]. Therefore, the economics are derived from the application of philosophy to society. And Marxist strategy flows from the Marxist analysis of economics and culture, still using dialectical materialism to perform that analysis and application. 

Seeing those connections, I guess you could say that Marxism is the application of dialectical materialism in the interests of the [[proletariat]], wrapping all the way back around to Lenin's idea that a Marxist is one who supports the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].
