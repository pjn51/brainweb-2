# How could we halt climate change?
Climate change will be a principal problem for humanity in the 21st century, so it's imperative that we take actions to reduce its effects. 

[[Military spending is massively pollutive]]. We could reduce global emissions by 0.4% if we eliminated it. 

When we see the massive scale of change required to even begin to address this issue, we can see that [[Only socialism can avert climate crisis]].
