*How can we combat overfitting?* Overfitting tends to happen with more complex models ([[Sensitive models risk hallucinating patterns]]) and this is a common [[machine learning]] issue during [[modeling]]. 

[[Regularization punishes model sensitivity]] and should be applied to models if we detect overfitting. 

On a deeper level, [[Complexity must be justified]] and we should just use a simpler model if we can allow for the bias that a simpler model may encourage.
