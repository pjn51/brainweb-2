# How should I treat others' ideas in my notes?
When I come across arguments that are being made by others, it sometimes feels restrictive to have notes titled "so-and-so believes this-and-that." But on the other hand, I don't want to uncritically bring ideas into my vault, especially when I'm not sure that I agree with them. 

How can I create a scaffolding here ([[Build scaffolding, not cages]])?

Perhaps I can create notes that are just called "this-and-that," and then say that "so-and-so supported this idea" within the note. 

This has some relevance to the question: [[How can a ZK account for changing beliefs?]] and I'm leaning more and more towards including all the steps in my thought process so that nothing is lost. 

Ultimately, I think that I need to think for myself, and be clear when I'm doing that versus when I'm explaining the line of thinking that others have put down. Therefore, I will continue to be honest about whose idea it is when writing an idea note. 

[[Do your own thinking]]! 

[[Things change through contradiction]], and I shouldn't erase the contradictions of various thinkers' arguments. Instead, I should have them all available, and look at their interaction to generate novel insights.
