*How can we estimate population characteristics?* When attempting to understand the nature of populations, we cannot hope to examine each individual. Therefore, we must rely on a *sample* of the population.

For this analysis, [[statistics]] is essential. Whitlock and Schluter define statistics as the study of methods to describe and measure aspects of nature from samples. [1] Using statistical methods, we can ensure that our samples reflect the characteristics of a population, and gain insights into the latter.
