*How can we apply dialectics to habit formation?* This is something that I was thinking about after reading [[Atomic Habits (2018)]] and [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989)]]. I believe that [[Habits are the foundation of lifestyle]], but I don't think anything I've read has incorporated the laws of [[dialectics]] to the formation and maintainance of [[habit|habits]]. 

The author of Atomic Habits actually approaches an answer to this question. [[James Clear describes a "plateau of latent potential"]] that incorporates the law of [[Quantity transforms into quality]] to habit formation.
