# What makes an organization sectarian?
One approach to this is Draper's: [[Draper defines a sect via three characteristics]]. I think that his third criterion (that a sect has rigid boundaries described by its political program rather than its relation to the social struggle) is the most important, but overall, Draper's account is a little too vague.

The best way to see if an organization is [[sectarianism|sectarian]] is to look at how their demands relate to the actually existing movement, and if their demands change as the movement develops. A sectarian organization stands apart from the struggle of the workers, demanding that the workers' movement conform to the organization's preconcieved notions of what the workers should be demanding. 

[[Marx and Engels argued for the integration of Communists into the working class]], and sectarian organizations reject this advice, preferring to remain pure and sterilized instead of wading into the muck of the actually-existing demands and beliefs of the [[proletariat]]. 

On the other hand, a healthy revolutionary party should be looking to the demands that the advanced workers are already making, perhaps in a scattered, confused way, and choose those that advance the cause of revolution to highlight and organize around. In this way, [[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]].
