# How does society develop?
This is the fundamental question that [[historical materialism]] seeks to answer. This is also relevant to the field of ecology, since human society has a dramatic impact on the natural world. 

I believe that [[Marxism]] is the theory that can best answer this question.
# [[What is Marxism?]]

In a political sense, Marxists argue that [[All history has been history of class struggle]]. We can see that [[Classes arise due to the needs of production]]. Marxists also argue that [[socialism]] is the next-higher stage of society from where we currently sit in [[capitalism]]. 
# [[What is capitalism?]]
# [[What is socialism?]]

The development of society is also tied intimately with the development of its [[state]]. 
# [[What is the state?]]

As society has developed, our relationship with the natural world and its resources has as well.
# [[How can we manage common resources?]]
