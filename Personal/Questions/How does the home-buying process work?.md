*How does the home-buying process work?* [[Eylen]] and I have been looking for a property to buy, and it's important to understand the process. 

After finding a place that you want to make an offer for, there are some things to research. [[It's important to investigate the HOA before buying a condo]], and [[Make sure to see an inspection before buying property]]. 

When you're sure there are no surprises awaiting you, it's time to make an offer. [[Offer strategy depends on the housing market context]]. After you submit, you can still back out if you have a contingency to rely on. [[There are multiple contingencies to protect you when buying a home]]. 

If your offer is accepted, you need to put down some earnest money. [[Earnest money is basically a deposit on a home]] to ensure you're serious. After that, closing typically takes 30 days for the lender to appraise, and for inspections and final walkthroughs to take place. Your down payment needs to be ready by closing day, 30 days after your offer was accepted.
