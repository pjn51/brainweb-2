# How can a ZK account for changing beliefs?
I know that [[Idea notes must be scoped]], but this can only go so far. At some level, all my idea notes are making claims. 

I want to figure out a way to incorporate my own ideas and beliefs, while allowing for these ideas to evolve over time, without me having to go back and edit all my notes whenever I change my mind, seeing as [[Note friction should be minimized]]. 

First of all, I could just extend on these ideas to the point of absurdity. Note *A* could be outright contradicted by note *B*, and then note *C* could build on *B*, and eventually note *A* would just be an irrelevant proto-idea in my network. 

However, this is a bit messy. This leaves ideas that I will come to know are incorrect on the same standing as my current ideas. 

I should remember that [[No experience is useless]]. Even when I come to disagree with my past self, it's still valuable to follow the chain of reasonings from their beginning to their conclusions. Keeping that in mind, it seems that I should preserve outdated, surpassed ideas. Also, [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]], so I shouldn't hesitate to make conclusions. 

This is fundamentally a note organization question. [[How should I treat others' ideas in my notes?]]
