# How can I detect compromise?
This is the fundamental question of my job at [[Atos]] as a Security Consultant. I have to parse through session [[data]] and come to a conclusion about the legitimacy of a login session.

- [[Browser UAs are easier to spoof than native ones]]
- [[Cloud MFAs are trustworthy]]
- [[Hosted sessions tend to have worse IP stats]]
- [[Legacy authentication is often compromise]]
- [[Tor utilizes onion routing to conceal user location]]
