# How does cognition work?
I think the process of absorbing information, processing it, and learning is really interesting. 

First of all, [[The material world exists]]. This means that [[Analysis must begin with observation]] of this material world, and its phenomena. However, it's impossible to arrive at the stage of observation without any preconceptions, either developed from witnessing past behavior, or socially imprinted onto us. 

Overall, [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]] in a [[dialectics|dialectical]] spiral that allows us to approach truth via successive approximation. This process is done on the basis of material need, not an abstract search for truth. Because of this, [[Abstractions should be useful]], and they can be useful even if they aren't strictly true.
