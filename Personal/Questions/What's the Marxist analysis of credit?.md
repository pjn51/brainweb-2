# What's the Marxist analysis of credit?
This is becoming more and more important, because [[Global debt has surpassed GDP]].

[[Credit severs money supply from the real economy]] by allowing rampant speculation and investment using predicted income rather than existing wealth. This system arose because [[Capitalism requires expansion]], and much of the economic growth after the 1980s was predicated on credit, but it lays the foundation for a credit crisis and the bursting of the speculative bubble that inevitably develops, since currency gains its value through its reflection of real wealth, not speculation.
