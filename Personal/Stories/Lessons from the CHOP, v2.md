 # Lessons From the CHOP, second draft

---
# Introduction
Widely reported on by the media, the "Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone," later renamed the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest," or just "CHOP," represented a surge of revolutionary energy the likes of which Seattle hadn't seen in a generation. Sparked by the murder of George Floyd, protestors took to the streets and depite fierce police repression, crowds swelled into the thousands. Demanding police abolition, release of arrested protestors, as well as various other reforms, daily protests compelled the Seattle Police Department to outright abandon the East Precinct, one of their central headquarters in the city. This area soon developed a reputation in the capitalist press as a lawless, "anarchist jurisdiction," but that was a lie. Those who occupied the area established a community garden, a mutual aid system, and other projects that reflected an honest, albeit naive, desire to establish a more equitable society. 

However, it was not to last. On the day that the Seattle Police Department retook the CHOP, the police outnumbered protesters twenty to one, easily retaking an area which once would have required a fierce battle to pacify. 

How could a movement so powerful die out so quickly? How could the city government, with approval ratings as low as 30%, withstand a mass movement that brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets? What does this mean for the future of the United States, and of capitalism? 

As Marxists, it is our job to understand such things. We can clearly see that errors of leadership led the mass movement down a false path, a dead end. By closely examining what led to the unrest, as well as the positive and negative characteristics of the movement, we can see a way forward to real change that can create a world where a gang of armed, vicious police are no longer needed, one where capitalism is no longer constricting human progress and provoking racial division. 

# What caused the unrest?
It was no wonder that the protests, starting in Minneapolis with the murder of George Floyd, found a strong echo in Seattle. The Seattle Police Department killed over 16 people from 2017 to 2019, all while working tirelessly to defend a system where more and more profits go to investors, CEOs, and other members of the ruling class, while standards of living decline, rates of homelessness and addiction multiply, and whole communities are erased in the name of "revitalization."

In this context, it's clear that the working class in Seattle was at a breaking point even before the pandemic revealed to us all just how willing the bosses are to let us die in the name of quarterly revenue. 

Mainstream bourgeois pundits and "experts" never cease to be surprised that eventually, the working class will stop putting up with the abuse. Countless opinion pieces and articles report that this movement emerged out of thin air. 

As Marxists, we can turn to Trotsky's idea of "the molecular process of revolution" to explain such phenomena. He said that while the capitalist media can only see the surface of events, we know that real change starts in the countless small abuses that are suffered by the workers at the hands of the state and the capitalists. Eventually, just as heat eventually causes water to boil, this anger emerges from the shadows and can shake the whole world, as it did in the summer of 2020. 

# In what ways did the movement succeed?
Without a revolutionary leadership to provide a backbone for the mass movement, the protests relied on the sheer courage and spontaneity of the masses. The masses were able to stand up to the police, whose repressive tactics have been honed for decades, and who were much better organized than the protestors. When confronted with such a force, thousands of workers and young people stepped up to the plate and risked arrest and injury to fight for change. Most protests were organized via anonymous flyers and Facebook groups, and most marches were led by young people who demonstrated enormous bravery in the face of brutal repression. 

How could the protestors, ordinary working people, take on armed, highly trained, disciplined members of the police force? The answer to this question is the central conundrum of the ruling class and its defenders - the power of the working class.

These events put the lie to the nonsense idea that American workers are too conservative, too lazy, or too dumb to defend their interests. We can clearly see that revolution is possible here in the United States, the belly of the beast of American imperialism. 

In many ways, the protest movement followed the same pattern as the very early stages of other successful revolutions. In order to see what stalled the movement, we must turn to the errors of tactics, strategy, and leadership of the movement. 

# What halted the movement?
Turning a harsh light to the errors of the movement is in no way dismissing it or criticizing change. In fact, only by sharply and clearly pointing out the errors of the past can we move beyond them and advance towards liberation. 

From the beginning, there were multiple outlooks present at each protest. This is to be expected, since it's only the process of struggle in which the consciousness of the masses can be clarified. We must turn to the two dominant tendencies within the movement: liberal reformism and ultra-left adventurism.

The dominant tendency, particularly at the beginning of the protest, was that of liberal reformism. Many believed that by voicing their opinion, waving a sign, and marching along a pre-approved route would be all that was necessary to make real social change. However, these folks were in for a rude awakening once the use of tear gas and brutality put the lie to the hollow promises of elected representatives. 

The repression doled out by the police only served to weaken this tendency, and strengthen the other: ultra-left adventurism. 

Marxists use the term *ultra-left* to describe groups that isolate themselves from the rest of the working class by their use of radical tactics and aesthetics for their own sake, irrelevant of the needs of the movement. This tendency was personified by the "black bloc" groups which sought direct confrontation with the police. Marxists are absolutely not opposed to confrontation, and we believe that in fact, a direct confrontation between the workers and the capitalist state is inevitable. However, to initiate such a confrontation before the workers have reached revolutionary conclusions is suicidal, and actually pushes most workers away from the struggle. 

It's very important to understand the way that consciousness shifts during intense periods like revolutions and social unrest in general. While many entered the movement with illusions in bourgeois democracy and the state, these illusions were beginning to fade under the harsh treatment by the police. This is where a revolutionary organization comes in, ushering these people towards revolutionary conclusions. Even while moving towards such conclusions, most workers were turned off by the slogans of some in the movement, such as "Hang the pigs," and the smashing of windows. 

When Marxists criticize such tactics, we have absolutely nothing in common with the rightwing scare-mongering of the capitalist media. We understand that no ruling class has ever given up their power peacefully, and fully embrace self-defense of the movement. However, the real work of revolutionaries isn't destroying property, nor is it getting arrested. Our purpose is to ensure that new layers of workers are being brought closer to the movement at all times, since the very survival of the movement depends on its grassroots support from the broader working class. We must also protect the movement from the influence that the capitalists will surely attempt to weild - there will always be attempts to dissuade the workers from taking their struggles to their logical conclusion. When the revolutionary party is behaving correctly, it can provide a strong backbone for the muscle of the mass movement to base itself on.

For an isolated group to become separated from the class inevitably leads to disaster and failure. As the working class recedes, the police are more and more capable of brutalizing those who remain, and we have seen this process unfold again and again throughout history.

Coupled with the counterproductive street tactics of the ultra-left tendency, we saw that the leaders were totally incapable of advancing past the stage of spontaneous struggle, towards a more conscious organization of the working class as a force capable of acting in its own interests. 

Instead, the leading voices chose the tactic of "horizontalism," declaring that there were no leaders in the newly liberated CHAZ. As Marxists know, leaders emerge organically within all groups, usually consisting of the most dedicated, energetic, or respected members. The urge to eliminate the unjust hierarchy that we experience every day is a noble one, but the only way to do this is by organizing the working class into a conscious force capable of taking power into its own hands. This means that we must make sure leaders are accountable and recallable by the workers whom they represent, yes, but we must first admit that they are leaders in order to hold them accountable. 

The only result of the attempt to halt the emergence of leaders was a total lack of responsibility and initaitive on the part of decision-makers. Learning from history, Marxists understand that uprisings, which this event certainly was, cannot stay half-completed forever. Sooner or later, the initiative will pass to the capitalists and their state, and the hammer will fall, or the anger of the masses will metastasize, and the uprising will gain a general character. 

Because of this, the only way forward for the movement would have been to create strong ties with the labor movement and the broader working class, allowing the initial demands of the movement to develop into a bold call for revolutionary change across the board. Far from being a betrayal of the initial demands relating to police brutality and systemic racism, such a program would be a bold assertion that black liberation can never be achieved while capitalism lives. In order to truly end racism, as well as all forms of oppression, we must tear out capitalism at the root, and the working class must take power in our own hands.

Instead of embracing these bold steps, the leaders of the movement, chose the easy, safe path of stagnation and ultimately death, whether they knew it or not. 

This lack of responsibility and clarity eventually culminated in the tragic shooting deaths of two teens by self-appointed sentries in the zone, who believed them to be right wing terrorists. As of writing, nobody has taken responsibility for the deaths caused by errors in organization that ultimately stem from the lack of any really revolutionary vision for the movement. 

Looking at history, we see that the masses cannot stay furious forever. Even the most corageous and dedicated class fighters must eventually rest, and this process is only accelerated when workers see that the movement has lost momentum and purpose. Only a few months after the retreat from the East Precinct, the SPD were able to use their forces to retake control, with far fewer arrests and less brutality than it would have taken at the height of the movement.

We should examine the flaws of the movement clearly, although not at all in the same way that the capitalist media does. The bourgeois news outlets point these deficiencies out in the hope that we will all bury our heads in the sand and put up with the abuses that we're constantly barraged with, from the everyday disrespect of bosses and politicians, to the senseless police murders that we witness again and again. 

This has nothing to do with our purpose of criticism. We seek to learn the real lessons of the movement, so that we can provide a clear path forward when the inevitable crisis of capitalism and the racial terror that it inflicts arises once again. 

# What's next?
Despite its half-complete and contradictory nature, the protest movement contains reasons for optimism. It demonstrated that the working class has a natural solidarity that the more pessimistic voices on the left love to doubt. Defying the racial animus that is promoted by capitalist, dog-eat-dog society, tens of thousands of workers from every race and identity turned out into the streets, risking arrest and brutality to stand with their fellow workers. We also saw solidarity strikes from the trade unions. 

It's clear that the most serious need for the future is a dedicated, trained, and organized Marxist tendency that can elevate, clarify, and advance the demands that the masses throw up during periods of fury. 

A massive reason for the failure of the movement was the lack of such leadership. The union movement, community organizations, and even self proclaimed socialist groups such as the Democratic Socialists of America and Socialist Alternative, to name the two largest, failed to productively engage with the needs of the movement. Blocked in large part by a reactionary strain of identity politics that attempted to isolate the Black struggle from a broader working class movement, they were sidelined by the wave of radicalization. 

Far from undercutting the radicalism of the masses, like we saw from the liberal reformists, or scaring the masses away, like the tactics of the ultra-lefts, a Marxist tendency must act as the counterpart to the masses: making the desires of the working class conscious and raising these impulses to the level of clear perspectives and slogans, while working to unify the most determined and conscious workers into a force that can lead the class to a successful revolution.

We can also see that such a group cannot be built during the intensity of mass struggle, just as the general staff of an army cannot be trained after the outbreak of war. We need to begin now, educating ourselves in history and theory, so that when the workers rise to the challenge of taking their fate in their own hands, we can win their confidence and provide a revolutionary way forward. 

For Marxists, the recent waves of unionization, protests for abortion rights, and an upswell in radicalism among the youth are all clear signals that the working class is preparing to come to its feet once again. It's our duty to meet them, and to work diligently to build an organization that can function as a leadership worthy of its name. 

Socialist Revolution in the USA, and the International Marxist Tendency globally, are aiming to build such an organization. We're organizing in Seattle and throughout the United States and the world to create a working-class leadership worthy of the name.
