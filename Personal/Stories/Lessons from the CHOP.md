 ## Introduction
Today, it has been nearly a year and a half since the collapse of the Capitol Hill Autonomouz Zone, later renamed the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest. Whatever name we assign to this phenomenon, we should be sure to emphasize its importance. At the height of the Black Lives Matter protests across the US, the working class of Seattle forced a well-funded, heavily armed police force to abandon one of their precincts in the heart of the city. This reflected a massive leap forward in the consciousness of the masses, and the movement had a downright insurrectionary character at times. In a time where many believe revolution to be impossible, especially in the United States, we should repeat this fact over and over again. 

## Background
In order to understand the signifigance of this event, we have to turn to the conditions that created the opportunity for it to happen. In Seattle, just like the rest of the United States, capitalism has proved fundamentally incapable of solving the basic problems of humanity. Since 2006, the GDP of the Puget Sound region has increased by 51% [^1] , while personal income has failed to keep up, rising by only 38% [^2]. During that same time period, homelessness has risen from nearly eight thousand in the Seattle area to nearly 12 thousand, an increase of 33% [^3]. Furthermore, more and more of these people are unable to find space in shelters that the city chooses to underfund. The Seattle metro working class creates hundreds of billions of dollars a year in profits, but the ruling class and their puppets in the city government force declining living standards and poverty on the workers. It is this situation that created the anger that mobilized the masses, along with the additional strain of the pandemic.

The outward expression of this anger was directed specifically at the police. Contrary to Seattle's "progressive" reputation, the Seattle Police Department has more than its fair share of abuses of power. They have a bloody history of using excessive force, and killed over 16 people between 2017 and 2019 [^4]. They were even targeted by a Department of Justice investigation over their conduct. 

Because of all this, it's no surprise that the protests after the murder of George Floyd spread quite easily to Seattle. 

## Taking to the streets
We can see the natural instinct towards unity present in the working class when we see how quickly the solidarity protests spread across the US, and Seattle was no exception. Within days of Floyd's murder, protestors were marching against police brutality. 

Taken off guard by the size and intensity of the protests, the police responded with repressive measures. The tear gas, pepper spray, batons and other brutality backfired, and only increased the anger of the crowds and their size. The labor movement, long dormant, began to stir with a one-day solidarity strike by the ILWU [^5] across the whole West Coast. 

The intensity rose to a fever pitch with eleven straight days of protests in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, at which point the SPD fled their precinct in the heart of the neighborhood. At this point, the protestors rightfully celebrated their victory, displaying the fact that nothing can stand in the way of the masses when they refuse to back down. 

The crowds erected barricades and began to establish mutual aid services and the beginning stages of self-government in what would soon become known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ. 

## Currents of the movement
As Marxists, we understand that within any mass movement there will be multiple layers with different outlooks, goals, and perspectives. This movement was no different. There was a largely liberal layer, who had the perspective of bourgeois electoralism, peaceful civil disobedience, and the agitation for reforms as a means to end the crisis. 

On the other hand, there was a significant layer of the youth who have seen that nothing comes of these milquetoast pleadings, and sought to take more aggressive action. This layer had an Anarchist bent, and was heavily covered by the bourgeois media as "Antifa." They pushed for confrontation with the police for its own merit, vandalized and destroyed property, and spouted radical-sounding slogans like "hang the pigs."

Marxists seek to stand between these two currents, raising the political level of the movement beyond the limited, cynical horizon of the liberals and reformists, but refusing to isolate themselves from the lefward-moving workers by the use of ultraleft, alienating slogans and tactics. 

Unfortunately, there was no such leadership present to engage with the movement in Seattle, and the overall strategy of the movement vacillated between these two groups. 

We can see this in the inability of the CHAZ to set a definitive course forward after it was established. The liberal wing of the movement had been scared off by the direct confrontation with the police, allowing the Anarchist wing to gain influence over the overall course of events for a time.

## Paralysis and indecision
Once the Anarchist mood had overtaken the movement, a kind of paralysis emerged. Pursuing an organizational method of "horizontalism," they refused to designate formal leaders, or adopt any sort of organizational structure at all. 

This had been a common feature of their tactics in the past, but such a method works much better for engaging in spontaneous clashes with the police on a nightly basis than it does for running anything, even a zone the size of a few city blocks.

From the beginning, there was a deliberate push to avoid electing any sort of leadership for the area, meaning that the trajectory of the movement drifted on the tides of bourgeois public opinion and base necessity. 

Security for the CHAZ was run in an irresponsible way, with self-proclaimed, armed sentries posted around the edges of the zone. While we have nothing whatsoever in common with the right-wing news outlets who characterized the zone as a lawless, dangerous slum, we would call on any movement facing such a situation to strongly tie the organs of self-defense to the democratically elected representatives of the movement, and not allow the most bold and adventuristic elements to declare themselves in charge. 

In this case, this unprofessionalism had fatal consequences that resulted in the deaths of two unarmed teenagers who were suspected of being right-wing agitators. Those who shot and killed the two teens have never been identified. 

## Collapse
The shooting deaths of the two teens, in addition to the inability of the CHAZ to keep the peace within its own borders, saw the support of the broader working class begin to dissapate. Without any direction, perspectives for the future, or ability to sustain itself, this process was inevitable. 

Those still invested in the CHAZ attempted to salvage the project through a terminological change: they argued that calling it an "autonomous zone" was the issue, and that changing it to "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" would reaffirm the original goal of protesting police brutality. Needless to say, it did not. 

By the time that the police moved in to retake the zone, they were able to do so with only a few arrests, where a similar attempt a month earlier would have taken hundreds, if it would even have been possible at all. Nearly two years on, the only evidence of the CHOP is a community garden and a beautiful mural on Pine st. The demands of the movement were watered down or ignored, and business has continued more or less as normal ever since. 

## Lessons
As Marxists, it's our job to learn the lessons of past movement, whether they happened 100 years ago or one. As Trotsky said, the fundamental crisis of our era is the crisis of working class leadership, and these events bring that into stark relief. 

An authentic Marxist leadership could have acted as a backbone to guard against the cowardly watering-down of the movement by the opportunists and reformists, while at the same time elevating the tactics and strategy above the juvenile and ineffective tactics of the Anarchists. 

This prognosis may seem bleak, but Marxists must sometimes play the role of doctor, focusing on the negative symptoms of the patient in order to give the latter the best chance of recovery. We ought not to forget the tremendous positive character of this event. In the heart of a major American city, the working class proved that we can stand against the state and its footsoldiers as long as we are determined, and these events proves that there is indeed such determination in a country long written-off as conservative and apathetic. 

We should not allow the mistakes of the leadership to determine our feelings towards those who genuinely fought for a better world, and bravely risked their own safety in order to stand up for the victims of police brutality. 

To the Marxists, the task ahead is clear - it's critically necessary to perform the patient work of building a leadership that will be large enough to catch the attention of the working class, and theoretically solid enough to provide guidance the next time events of this nature appear, as the cruelty of the capitalist system will ensure.
