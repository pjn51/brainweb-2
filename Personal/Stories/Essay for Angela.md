A1
This paper will compare the healthcare systems of the United States and Germany.

A2
The German healthcare system is a multi-payer universal system, while the United States has a mixture of public and private insurers and care providers. In the United States, the Medicare program provides healthcare for those over 65 and some people with long-term disabilities. Low income families, including the unemployed, may be covered under Medicaid. Additionally, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides coverage for the children of low-income families. 

In Germany, healthcare is provided to the unemployed free of charge, while most individuals are covered by statutory health insurance provided by a publicly-owned insurance provider. Children are covered under this plan, as well as the elderly and retired.

A2a
In the United States, access to prescription drugs, and any copayment needed, is determined by individal insurance plans and state regulations under the Affordable Care Act, while in Germany, all prescription medications are covered, with copayments for outpatient prescriptions. 

A2b
In the United States, referrals for specialists may be required depending on the patient's insurance, and those on Medicaid or without insurance may be denied access by specific specialists who prefer catering to those on private insurance plans due to the higher reimbursement per patient. In Germany, specialists do not require a referral or have restrictions based on the patient's insurance.

A2c
In the United States, due to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions or charge them higher premiums due to their conditions. In Germany, coverage cannot be denied, but those with preexisting conditons may face higher costs if they choose private health insurance. 

A3
The healthcare system in the United States is relatively expensive for the individual. Depending on insurance, the individual is usually required to pay total healthcare costs until their deductible is met, at which point they may continue to pay a part of total costs. Programs like Medicare and Medicaid are funded through a combination of state taxes, premiums, and federal taxes. An implication of high healthcare costs is that those with no insurance often forego preventative care, worsening their health in the long term and creating more costs and hardship overall. 

In Germany, every employee contributes to the sickness fund, with a maximum deduction based on the employee's income. Those who want to opt-out of the public system may purchase private insurance. An implication of this more accessible system is that the German system results in more preventative care, causing savings in the long run on emergency services.
