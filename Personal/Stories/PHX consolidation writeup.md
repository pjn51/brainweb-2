# Writeup discussing the PHX consolidation system

> This is going to be released to branch as a primer for a discussion on how we're organizing consolidation in the next period. 

During the Western Regional Committee call that I attended on the 5th, I was introduced to a new system of note-taking that the Phoenix branch is using during one-on-one meetings, or as they call them, consolidation meetings. I wanted to write this to explain this system, what I see as pros and cons of it, in order to prime us for a discussion on how we can use this for our branch, either in the form that the PHX branch is using, or in a modified form. 

First, I will explain why I think this is an important thing to discuss. Then, I will outline the system that PHX is using, and then I will raise a few questions for discussion. 

To begin, let me motivate the reasons for this discussion. Out of the eight active members we have now, only three have been in this branch for one year. A democratic organization is only as politically developed as its average member, and the average of our organization nationally, as well as our branch, is naturally declining as we grow. Growth is a good thing, but it means we need to be conscious about the way in which we're bringing newer comrades up to the highest political level possible. This is not to say that those "veteran" comrades have completed their political education - far from it. By helping newer comrades, older ones will consolidate their own understanding and skills. 

Now we can turn to the concrete ways in which I believe that we should reinforce this process. First of all, we should make sure that every comrade has a partner who they are meeting with, ideally twice a month. I believe we do have such a system in place, but we should discuss how we can ensure that meetings are taking place with all comrades. 

Second, we should clarify what the purpose of these meetings are. They are primarily about reading and discussing some work of theory, such as a book or article. They also serve another purpose. They ought to create a space in which newer comrades can ask questions about anything that comes up during their engagement with the branch. This should open clear lines of communication throughout the branch, without which our clarity will suffer. More experienced comrades should be sure to cultivate an environment where the newer comrade is confortable raising points of difference or clarifying questions about any aspect of our work. 

Thirdly, these meetings should have an organizational aspect to them. For comrades who have duties within the branch, time should be given to discuss how that work is going, and what could be improved about it. This will become more and more important as our work develops, and more comrades take on responsibilities for various areas of the work. 

Now, I can turn to the system that PHX is using in their meetings. Please use this link to follow along with the form that is provided in Box:

In this system, each comrade has a note like this assigned to them. It lists their responsibilities, any contacts that they're meeting with, as well as what literature they've read from the first-year reading list. Notably, it also includes a section for SMART goals. For those unfamiliar with the idea of SMART goals, SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measureable, Achieveable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

1. Specific: these goals should be narrow, with a single task in mind.
2. Measureable: there should be an objective way to evaluate if a goal has been met.
3. Achievable: this goal shouldn't be impossible. It should be within reach.
4. Relevant: this goal should align with long-term plans.
5. Time-bound: have a deadline for this goal.

An example of a bad goal would be: "Our branch should have some sort of social media presence." A SMART goal interpretation would be: "Comrade PN will act as social media officer, posting three times a week on the Seattle IMT Facebook page. Let's set a goal of 10 new followers and 20 posts this month." (note: I am not proposing this goal right now, it's just an example). 

I think there are benefits and drawbacks to taking such a detailed approach to consolidation. Of course, this would allow for greater professionalism if the system can be adhered to. On the other hand, I think that in the past in our branch, we've had the issue of over-extending our tools and structures. For example, we had a few google sheets that were perpetually out-of-date and weren't updated frequently. Because of that experience, I tend towards simplicty and minimalism when it comes to the use of tools for organization. However, I recognize that we're getting to the size where maybe more complex structures and tools would be useful.

With that, I can turn towards some questions that I have for everyone:

1. How do people feel like their own consolidation is progressing? What are roadblocks, and what is working well?
2. What do people think about the tool that PHX has been using?
3. If we were to begin using this template, or a similar tool, do people think that it would be sustainable?
4. If we were to make modifications to this tool, what would those look like for our branch? 

I'm looking forward to our discussion of these issues. It's extremely exciting to me that we're getting to the point where these conversations are needed!
