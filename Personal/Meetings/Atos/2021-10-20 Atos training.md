# Jake Johnston
- History and work style
	- No set baseline for tickets
	- He does like 50 a day, they haven't spoken to him about it
	- We used to be able to use any computer we wanted, but they changed the work policy
- Remoting in
	- I should go to [chrome remote desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com) and set up a remote session
	- Change power settings to never turn off
- General comments
	- The m247 IP org is often suspicious
- Return to the office
	- They *are* planning on returning to the office as soon as Microsoft gives the go-ahead, which will likely be in January

# Matt Goyra
- History and work style
	- Grades fast, like Jake
	- Does a lot of app grading with Andrew
	- Normally grades 40-50
	- He prefers to avoid "suspicious" and either do "compromised" or "NOTcompromised" because those grey area grades are pretty meaningless
	- He's worked here for 1.5 years
	- Before that, he was a PM for Xbox doing account recovery and stuff
	- Moved to overseeing the Xbox hardware call centers for a few years. The nepotism there burnt him out and he quit
	- He did mission control for a little while, which was super stressful (dealing with triage for outages and stuff worldwide)
	- Atos wanted to give us laptops, but MS insisted on these old computers for some reason
- General comments
	- They want quality more than quantity
	- The office was sort of nice because we could have free drinks and really cheap food
	- m247 is a *free* hosting site, that's why it's suspicious

# Jonathan Ma
- Work style and history
	- On average, he grades 7 or 8 per hour
	- Been here over three years
	- He came in right when they transitioned to this work
- General comments
	- Grading speed depends heavily on the bucket
	- Over time, there has been more and more separation between our team and the data scientists
