## Introduction
This is a [[career]] support meeting with my [[Metis]] career advisor, Jennifer Raimone. 

## Points to cover
- Cover letter technical level vs story vs readability
- Not hearing back from LinkedIn recruiters
- Audience for blog posts
- Number of applications per week (7 on average)

## Cover letter discussion
- People care more about interest in the company (first paragraph)
- Second, qualifications
- Third, story
- Fourth, thanks

## Blogs
- Make it more technical, since I'm entry level
- Maybe say it in a technical way, and then rephrase it to serve both audiences

## Applications discussion
- Mostly cold applications, avoid that
- Always follow up if you get left on read
	- Be polite but follow up!
	- Make your question specific and urgent (based around a specific role)
	- Just ask for ten to fifteen minutes
- Reaching out to companies
	- Smaller companies -> either few recruiters that are specialized or no recruiters who hire a third party agency
	- Large companies -> so many recruiters, gotta reach out to the right one
		- Look at Linkedin bio to see. Maybe ask if they can connect you with the right person. 
		- Always follow up!
	- Find people on the team and connect with them
	- If they're alumni, slack and messge them on LN. 

## Overall
- Increase number of hours and connect with more people
-
