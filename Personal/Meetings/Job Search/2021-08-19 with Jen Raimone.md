# Meeting with Jen Raimone
`DATE:` Thursday, August 19, 2021
`WITH:` Jen Raimone
`TAGS:` #meeting/career

---
# Topics to discuss
- Overall strategy change to data analysis
- Saturation of data analysis market vs [[data science]]
- Value of a datasci bootcamp these days
- Change stash title to data analyst?

# Notes
- Warm vs cold
	- Warm ones matter *way* more
- [[data science industry]]
	- Market is certainly saturated, but what's the source on that info? The last 2 cohorts have gotten tons of [[interviews]]
- Perhaps don't pivot *too hard*
	- Data analyst positions
	- Business intelligence
	- Data science
- Software dev option
	- If I'm ok with leaving the [[Metis]] skills behind, go for it
	- No harm in trying both data analyst and dev positions
- Current performance is due to slow start and cold applications
- Recent grad was very blue collar, had hustler mentality, landed data science job two months after graduation. 
- Give it more time in the advanced analytics and data sci realm
- No regional factor at play really
- It's all a matter of mindset, perserverence, engaging with contacts
- They talked to large company today that wanted the [[career]] team at Metis to keep track of applicants to their company, since applicants often just get lost in the system. 
- If I go with software dev, I should waive my career stuff, but I can still get access to career things. 
- Final advice
	- Keep focusing on advanced analytics / data science
	- Put feelers out for software development
	- Work through warm applications
	- Holidays are lurking! Once we get into mid-October, hiring slows down and people go on vacation. 
	- Be careful not to ask too many people their opinions, everyone has a different one and they base it on their own experience! Jen has the experience of hundreds of grads. 
	- Become active on LinkedIn! This allows us to show up in search results. Post some articles and give your take or a little blurb. 
	- HUNTRBOARD.co is a good way to organize a job board. 
	- Don't downplay the STASH work at all. Don't oversell, but play it up a bit
