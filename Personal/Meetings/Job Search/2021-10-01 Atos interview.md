# Why I want to work at Atos
- Getting more cybersecurity experience
- Working in a larger structure
- Opportunity for growth through Atos

# General experience
- ESCI, bootcamp, and industry at Stash
	- ESCI --> critical, careful thinking
	- Bootcamp
		- Handling, understanding large datasets
		- Use of statistical reasoning, inferences
		- Finding patterns
		- Tech literacy
	- Industry
		- Working within and across teams
		- Working with servers on a daily basis
		- Verifying, cross-referencing wholesaler account information
		- Judging against common account behavior
		- Using common sense to make judgements based on limited data (location, payment info)

# Technical knowledge
- My experience finding patterns in data
	- Cleaning and managing large datasets
	- Establishing baselines for wholesaler user behavior
		- Banking info
		- Location
- IP address basics
	- Internal IP  = set by router
	- External IP = set by ISP
	- IP addresses can change due to modem reset, other reasons
	- Routing = the process of sending data through a server that might be far away
- Detecting fraud
	- Check info against the standard user baseline
		- IP address
		- Location
		- Time
		- Device type

# My questions
- How will my grades be evaluated?
- v6 arrived in 2012, are v6 IP addresses used yet?
- As biometrics emerge as more and more prominent, 
- Where do tickets / sessions go when we grade them as suspicious?
- What is the onboarding process like?
- Anything holding you back
- When will I hear back

-----------------------------------
# Notes from Jake
- Kinds of data they use for sessions
	- Location
	- IP
	- Device ID sometimes
	- Browser and OS
- Workflow
	- Establish baseline
	- Match session to baseline using the data
	- Grade sessions against baseline
- Edge cases
	- Comes down to personal opinion
	- Better to be too conservative than too liberal
- Generic cybersecurity stuff and tech questions
- IP address format
	- 4 sets of up to three numbers
	- First set is more general, last is most specific
	- v4 vs v6
		- v6 is newer, allows for more devices
		- Longer string of numbers *and letters*
- "Who is" lookup
	- A query on the IP address
	- You can get a lot of information
- Internal vs external IP
	- Routers set internal addresses
	- External usually ends with zero but not always
	- They use the external IP for grading
- MAC address
	- Not something that they directly work with
	- The hardware ID of the device
	- Doesn't change ever
	- This is the real identifier of the device
	- They don't use it that often since internet signons don't request the MAC address
- Salary
	- They offered 60k, he countered at 65k. 
- MFA
	- Authenticator app for computer login
	- Single factor authentcation is just a password
	- MFA is any form of other authentication
- Frame my stash experience in terms of cyber security stuff
- How is performance evaluated
	- 10% of our sessions have overlap
	- Diagreement rate is monitored and evaluated monthly
- Sessions per day
	- There's no published baseline for how many sessions to do daily
	- Jake grades 40 to 60 per day and hasn't heard anything
- Onboarding process
	- Grading with a buddy for a few hours
	- Then you're on your own
