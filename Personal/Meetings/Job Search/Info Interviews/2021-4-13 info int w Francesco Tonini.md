- California has the most advanced team and has the most money within TNC. 
- He can be working on 3-4 projects at once sometimes

## Background
- Batchelors and masters in statistics
- Got a pHd in GIS (geomatics)

## TNC overview
- Big company
- Lots of scientists
- Started as land and freshwater, expanded to the marine world. 
- Global teams tend to hire from academia
- IT tends to be more of a stable income but isn't as fun as the science stuff. 
- Opportunities for entry level jobs do exist on these global teams.

## Current projects
- Carbon analysis
- Deforestation
- Amazon donated money for global carbon pool assessment so they're doing that
- TNC does marine stuff as well, especially in California. They use image recognition to count whales and stuff. 

## Tools / Process
- [[Python]] and [[R]]
- Python dominates the geospatial field
- There are cloud providers that don't require local environment setup. 
- More and more, they're using [[cloud computing]] tools that already have data as a service. No need to import and pre-process everything. 
- Other TNC teams ask for assistance on projects. These other teams work with stakeholders or donors who have specific needs. 

## Interesting projects
- Land cover classification
- Road detection
- Species detection from imagery
