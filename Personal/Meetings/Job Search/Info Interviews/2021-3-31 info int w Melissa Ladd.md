---
Melissa manages a NOAA contract for [[Lynker Analytics]]. She got her masters right out of undergrad, in env managment at Duke. Now she does program mangement and operational stuff so a MS is worth it. First job out of school was a nonprofit. It ended up being grassroots organizing and stuff. Then she went to work for a NOAA contractor. This pays better than her nonprofit thing. Now shes had 4 roles at this contractor. 

She has a PMP certification (project manager professional) and that's been worth it. Now she supervises 15 contractors and runs a graduate fellowship of 30 students.
