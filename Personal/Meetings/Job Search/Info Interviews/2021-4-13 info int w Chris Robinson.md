Chris Robinson is a Senior Remote Sensing Analyst at NOAA's Office for Coastal Management in South Carolina. 

## What has your journey been like to get to where you are today?
- Works on coastal change analysis program, basically land cover [[data]].
	- Started with LANDSAT
	- Documenting change every 5 years in coastal systems.
	- Moving towards IKONOS and other platforms instead of LANDSAT
	- ML tools are enabling them to map larger areas at higher resolutions
- Working on second Masters in [[data science]]
- Batchelors in geography, masters in geo with remote sensing specialty
- Office for coastal management since 2002, first job out of grad school
- 

## Are there any directions you want to move in your career?

## What kinds of tools do you work with day-to-day?

## What does an average week look like for you?

## What is the format for projects (time scale / team size)?
- 23 class system for their land cover
- Start with fundamental cover types, then specify
- They work with a standard data source so ingestion is easy. 
- Reprojection into designated coordinate system
- Incorporation of LiDAR for canopy mapping and bare earth model to identify areas of poor drainage and wetlands
	- They just use LiDAR if its available, and NOAA gets a lot of the data from privately commissioned flights. 
- Processing using python
- Generate output land cover maps, quality assurance is a long process
- Target accuracy of 85%
- Outreach component - webinars, presentations, etc. Inform people on how to use the data 
	- Presentations to other government groups in relation to deep learning
	- Coastal geotools conference with an AI / ML session
	- NOAA working groups on AI strategy and staying relevant

- Team is 10 people
- Mix of feds and contractors
- Fed employees have better job security and benefits, retirement, etc. 


- Moving towards the use of GANs for imagery. 
- Podcasts
	- Python bites
	- Python 2 me
- Blogs
	- Medium, TDS, etc.

## What are the challenges facing the field today?


## Do you mainly work with GIS-specific tools like ArcGIS?
