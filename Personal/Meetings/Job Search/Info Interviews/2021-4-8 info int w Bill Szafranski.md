---
Bill is a Water Resources Scientist at Lynker. I'm interested to ask about his [[career]] and see if he has any advice.

## Questions to ask
### What does an average week look like for you? What tools and platforms do you use, and what projects do you apply them to? How long are you working on a project on average?
Workflow varies. Right now he's working for 5 different clients and for most of them they have one project. For a couple, there are ongoing things that could be related to two or three projects. 

Projects / contracts can last a few years. 

Day to day:
Dependent on project. Sometime he doesn't code anything for 3 months, sometimes he codes every day. 

The Boulder office has 10-12 on the team. Lynker has 400+. 

### What has your career trajectory been like? Where and when did you get the relevant skills that allow you to do the work you do today?
Started with E studies degree. Switched towards hydrologic sciences which was more math heavy. After graduation he had a year of bouncing around. Then, he started doing water sampling. He did that sort of thing for five years or so since he had a chem background. 

He did sampling, maintaining water sampling stations, and stuff like that. He did his grad program at CU Boulder through civil engineering. Now he's more modeling focused. He does lots of watershed models, modeling for the weather service and multi-jurisdiction govt projects. 

He also models water supply and modeling. 

His career has been divided into two portions - the field work stuff he used to do, and the modeling stuff 

### What is the role that [[data science]] tools play in your workflow? Things like classification and regression models, predictive analysis, etc. Do you use python directly, or integrated with proprietary software, or not at all?
For watershed models, they use specific prepackaged tools. They also have an in-house model. As far as general modeling, he primarily uses [[R]] but uses Python from time to time. 



### Do you know anything about the Water Resources Data Scientist role at Lynker? Can you connect me to someone who I can talk more with about this role?
They want somebody experienced in C and Fortran for this role to really be building models from scratch. 

When they post a job, it's tailored for the job quite specifically. The process is that the job is posted, they wait for referrals or applications, then they go to the interview process. Lynker doesn't do take-home projects or anything like that.
