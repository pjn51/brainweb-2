- Side effects of [[remicade]] and [[azathioprine]]. When do they appear?
	- Most don't have side effects. However it can raise risk of infection by 5%. Increased risk of skin cancer, as a function of sun exposure. Potential increase risk of lymphoma but not that much, and it goes away after I get off azathioprine.
- Staying on remicade forever?
	- Remicade with correct loading dose on schedule, and azathioprine for 6-12 months gives a good chance of response, and maintaining remission long-term. 
- When to end aza?		
	- At least six months, ideally a year. We assess after one year, and if inflammation is lower, then I have a good chance of remaining well after dropping azathioprine.
- Next option if symptoms re-occur.
	- If antibodies, then switch to [[humira]] or Cimzia (similar medicines).
	- If I lose response, then we need to switch to different class of medication, like [[stelara]].
	- Reviewing bone density timeline (he said repeat in a year or two in 2020, so two years means re-test next year).
- I'm due for numavaxx any time now.
- I need one more hep B shot.
- We should schedule a MRI to see how my gut is doing. He's going to order one, and I can call radiology to schedule that, as well as a bone density test.
- I'm slightly *aenemic* so that should be looked into if it persists. They can follow up after my next blood test.
