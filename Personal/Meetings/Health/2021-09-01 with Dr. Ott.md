# Notes
I spoke with Dr. Ott at the UW bone density clinic today. She recommended that I work on improving my calcium intake through diet instead of going straight to medication. I basically have [[osteoperosis]] at this point.

She described the options for medication. The classic medication is zolodronate, which is in IV form. I would have to take an infusion once a year or so. The issue is that it's only safe to do this for 5 years, and after 10 years from the initial dose, the protection goes away. If I do it too long, my bones will become brittle. 

There is a new medication called romosozumab, which actually builds bone instead of just protecting existing bone like the classic medication does. This hasn't been studied that much in patients with [[Crohn's disease]], but it's promising. 

If I get into another flare, I should call them and get on the classic meds because I really can't lose any more bone density. Otherwise, we should use the classic meds as a last resort, and perhaps I should revisit getting on the new meds in 8 or 9 months. In the meantime, I should go see their physical therapists for spine strengthening exercises.
