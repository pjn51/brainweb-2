I should research [[entyvio]]. It’s an infusion every 8 weeks. This would be his #1 choice. [[remicade]] is also an option if we want to also focus on arthritis, which I don't have. 

Other therapies include self injections, like [[humira]]. This isn't his favorite, since it’s every 2 weeks and you have to be careful. 

Xeljanz is a small-molecule drug in pill form. It’s on the newer side which is being explored currently. Another in development is rinvoq but it’s harder to get since it isn't approved yet. The main issue with Xeljans is increasing shingles risk, so I would need a shingles vaccine. 

[[azathioprine]] is a med like [[prednisone]] that insurance might make us try before others. We should try and skip this if we can. It has an increased risk of lymphoma involved. 

We need to do some bloodwork to see if I’m eligible for any of these drugs, and then we need to get it approved by insurance. The blood work will take 2 weeks to come back. 

Book to buy: IBD Self-Management by Sunanda Kane.

The CCFA 

Tim Zissman would be a good source for a 2nd opinion. 

Even if I want to keep trying [[LDN]], I should still do the lab work. Fecal calprotectin should be monitored monthly, so that we can see a potential flare coming up.
