Azo side effects are really notieceable if they happen, so i probably don't have any. 

Continuing with regime, since I'm doing better. 

Get another flu shot in the fall. 

10 mg or less prednisone isn't a treatment dose. It basically doesn't count towards vaccine stuff. I can get vaccine immediately. Separate 48 hours from infusion. 

Get numavaxx on May 1st. 

My skin cancer risk is elevated due to meds. Wear sunscreen. 

Bone density changes so slowly so we should repeat tests in more than 2 years. 

MRI in three months.
