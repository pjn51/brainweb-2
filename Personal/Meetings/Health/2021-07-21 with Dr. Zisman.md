	- Results
	- Follow-up date
- Anaemia
	- Did not persist?

# Notes
- My BMI is 20 which is healthy. 
- Started [[azathioprine]] in February, should end next February. 
- MRI
	- Better than last Feb but not perfect
	- 3cm segment of narrowing, 4cm narrowing are the two segments in the recent MRI.
	- Old MRI doesn't quantify the length of affected areas. 
	- Overall, mild inflammation in two short segments.
- Scar tissue can develop without inflammation ðŸ˜¢
- Bone density
	- Changes really slowly
	- Not surprising to see no difference within a year
	- Metabolic bone disease clinic
- I qualify for heightened survelience of colon cancer
	- I should scope every 1-2 years
	- We should scope again in February 2022, then we can assess stopping [[azathioprine]] as well as scanning for cancer.
