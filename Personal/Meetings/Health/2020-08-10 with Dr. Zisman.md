Things to cover:
- What insurance does his office accept?
- Setting up infusions in [[Seattle]]
- Insurance

Look on VM website or contact the billing office

He will request a change to the location for the infusion, so we can move it to [[Seattle]]. 

There’s no need for me to continue with the mesalamine. It doesn't really do anything. 

In order to see if i'm improving, we can look at 1) my symptoms, and 2) an objective measure such as a stool fecal calprotectin test. We should repeat this in another few months. 

They recommend keeping up to date with flu shots (september). If I do it through local pharmacies, let Zisman know. They also recommend pneumonia vaccination. I should also get a Hep A test, and a Hep B vaccination. 

I should get a colon cancer test next year and a bone density test. Crohns and steroids can cause thinning of the bones. I’ll have to call the radiology dept to set that one up. 206-341-1700. Call tomorrow to set it up. 

Do I have a pneumonia vaccination? Check on that.
