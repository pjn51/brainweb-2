# ✅ Topics to discuss
- Current weight
	- Currently 153, been gaining 2-4 lbs a month since September
- Incorporating greek yogurt back into diet
- Hidden inflammation?
	- It is possible to have increasing inflammation

# ✏️ Notes
- She says that dairy is better to re-introduce rather than gluten.
	- Safest: fermented foods like yogurt, 
	- Safer: aged cheeses (less lactose), still don't eat every day
	- Lactose is linked with inflammation, so lactose free milk is better than the normal variety
	- Local sourcing is best
- Some kinds of dairy are much better than others, while gluten is mostly mass produced. American wheat is shitty, try to import from other countries if possible. 
- Calcium: try to get 1,000 mg. Increase this if you're on steroids. Dairy is highest in mg per portion, but other things are fortified with calcium like alt milks, eggs, 
- My clinical 'ideal' body weight would be 150 - 182 lbs. 

# Todo
- Check to see if Oatly is calcium fortified
- Count calcium intake for a few days
