## Best Practices for Finances
- Worth re-reading documents
- Lead with a political point on all finance points.
- The finance officer must connect political struggle with finance
- Establish rythm
- Some branches do a "dues day" on the first branch of the month
- Verbal report once a month to the branch
	- Is everyone caught up, what's the fighting fund at, etc.
- Repetition builds the pattern of people paying dues on time.
- Building up a fighting fund would be a good idea.
- Bookkeeping methods
	- The next step up from Venmo is one of these online-only bank accounts (dime, simple are some companies that do this).
	- However a venmo makes a lot of sense for our size. No need for a full bank account.
	- Keep your receipts and enter things immediately! Make sure there's a paper trail for all transactions.
- When to use branch discounts
	- We should use BRANCH as a discount code when we purchase materials *for the branch*. Individual branch members shouldn't use this for bookstore purchases.

## Annual Drive for the National Center
- Can comrades give part or all of their stimulus checks?
- The goal is $200,000 which is ambitious but possible
- The National Center is funelling this [[currency|money]] to the International Center, which spends the money to follow up with comrades and potential comrades from literally all around the world. 
- The website has over 4 million visitors per year at this point and needs more resources. 
- The US gives an outsized contribution relative to our membership numbers. 
- We plan to increase our contribution to the international work to 20% of funds this year. This is a 45% increase from last year. This amounts to $20 per month per member. 
- The International Center plans to purchase an office in London, so this money is sorely needed. The [[real estate]] market there is pretty expensive. 

## Todo
- Research methods to organize cash.
- Meet with RL tomorrow.
- Meet with AC to finalize splitting branch finances. 
- Re-read finance bulletins from 2014 and 2018 in the AC at some point.
