## MN Teamster / Trotskyist strike discussion
-   A good theoretical basis for struggle is essential. It allows us to know what to expect from our enemies. It also allows us to know when to push ahead and when to hold ourselves back when the moment isn't right. 
-   This strike action turned an entire city from a “scab’s paradise” to one of the most densely unionized cities in the [[USA|United States]]. Areas that are seen as bastions of reaction today can be [[unions]]' strongholds of the future. After all, exploitation lays the foundation for revolt. 
-   Under what circumstances will the IMT change focus towards instigating labor actions?
-   The Communists called on the AFL to lead the strike, knowing that the AFL would never come down on the side of the workers. By asking the AFL to lead, the Communists were able to expose them as frauds and win more support (see [[Marxists should use positive demands]])
-   What were the lasting effects of the strike, where did the momentum go?
	-   The CIO was created off this momentum, and a wave of industrial unionism swept the country. Millions entered industrial unions during this period.
