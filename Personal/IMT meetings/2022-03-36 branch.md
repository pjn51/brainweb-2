- My intervention
	- The CPC was filled with some of the most dedicated and heroic revolutionaries of all time, we honor their legacy by frankly pointing out their mistakes

# ðŸ“¥ Engaging with the union movement
- Why do we want to engage?
- How can we engage?
	- Getting jobs in unions
	- Supporting strikes and rallies
	- Targeted recruitment efforts at specific workplaces
- Best practices in workplace political work
	- Being an upstanding worker (don't give the boss ammo, gain respect)
	- Use of facts, arguements rather than labels that may scare people away
	- May have to be down-low about membership or political allegiance
	- No need to rush, can recruit over time
- Best practices on the picket line
	- We're there to listen and support, not make demands of the workers
	- Don't push paper sales, but sell the paper if a conversation leads there
	- Bring our contacts and youth members to the picket
- Influencing strike strategy from inside
	- We argue that maximum solidarity is needed, not workplaces or job titles isolated in their own unions
	- We cannot stand up to the leadership alone, but by putting forward positive demands ([[Marxists should use positive demands]]), we can gain the attention of sympathetic workers in the union over time
	- Make sure demands are visible by the workers, not only the leaders
- Best practices in unionization drives
	- We're not at a size where we can really do this effectively
	- Argue that the workers must be ready to fight for their own interests, not rely on the trade union bureaucracy
- Examples from our recent work in the Marathon lockout
	- Background: Minneapolis oil refinery workers went on a one-day strike protesting poor safety conditions, management locked them out and hired scab labor
	- Union leaders had no idea what to do, it became a war of attrition and eventually the union gave in
	- Learned to talk to more conservative workers respectfully but without backing down or hiding our ideas
	- The results benefited from sustained and patient work day after day
