## Election 2020 and the Fight for Socialist Revolution
### What should we make of [[Biden]]'s win?
Exit polls and downballot elections show that voter enthusiasm was very low for [[Democratic Party|the Democrats]] in general, and [[Biden]] most likely won because of personal dislike of [[Trump]], not a repudiation of the Republicans or Trumpism in general. 

We can look back to the Obama administration, which controlled all branches of government for 2 years, to see that the [[Biden]] administration will do even less that the meager reforms the Obama administration created. 

The strategy of the Dems was to fight for moderate Republicans in the suburbs instead of trying to expand the vote in the working class or other traditionally Democratic groups. 

### What will Biden do?
He will try and paper over the recent events, and go back to the Obama era. This is impossible! He has already talked about a government of national unity, just another excuse to move the party right and isolate left-leaning elements. They are firmly in favor of [[class independence|class collaborationism]], and seek to make working class Americans view themselves as having the same interests as the special interest groups that really control the Democratic Party. 

[[Biden]]'s main goal is to repair the institutions that were shown to be hollow and base by [[Trump]]. The Presidency, the courts, and congress were all shown by [[Trump]] and the Republicans to be crass organs of class rule under [[Trump]]'s admin. In practice, this means that the Democrats will cave to the demands of the Republicans even more eagerly than Obama did. 

We can be sure of one thing. Nothing [[Biden]] will do will fundamentally adress the issues of capitalism. He may play his cards skillfully, or make a fumble and bring the working class to a boil once again. 

### What is [[Trump]]'s base?
He has significant [[lumpenproletariat|lumpen]] elements that compose his most rabid supporters. 

This base also includes millions of angry workers. This is because of the lack of any working class party in the US. Since there is no outlet for working class anger, this anger is expressed in a deformed and distorted way, with many workers switching from one party to another in search of a way out under capitalism. Bourgeois pollsters and 'experts' can't understand this process as a dialectical one, and the Democrats use every swing right as an excuse to move themselves farther right, further removing any real choice for the workers. 

### What about the unions?
### The labor leadership
The labor leadership has spent hundereds of millions of their members' dollars in supporting the Democrats. These people are clear-cut members of the [[labor aristocracy]] and must be swept aside if the unions are to become a truly democratic institution of the workers. 

Their efforts to muddle the class questions have confused the membership, and decreased their class [[class consciousness]] in recent decades. 

### The membership
The unions are no longer integrated seamlessly into the Democratic machine. 40% of union households voted for [[Trump]] and the Republicans. After decades of being taken for granted by the DNC, these institutions are losing faith in the DNC and looking for alternatives. Since the only alternative now is the RNC, that's where they go. 

[[Trump]] has been more skillful than [[Biden]] in mobilizing these layers. The Dems are portrayed as wanting to shut down the economy without any help for workers, and [[Trump]] is at least going to allow them their livelihoods, and claims to be able to bring back the social conditions of the past, where high-paying jobs were more available for the working class. 

These workers are not permanently conservatives. They are searching for a way out on the basis of class, and are rationally choosing the party that is providing a message that seems best, regardless of the fact that this message is an trick. Both parties are liars, why not vote for the liar whose lies sound nicest?
### How can we defeat [[Trump]]?
In order to destroy his coalition, we need a working class party. A party appealing directly to workers and the issues they care about, backed by the unions, would rip millions of workers away from *both* parties. 

These workers won't join a tiny group, much less a tiny Marxist group. However, they *will* join a mass party of the working class. 

### What is the main task for the revolutionary party today?
Capitalism is a sinking ship, no matter how slowly or quickly this process happens, we have to get off! As a capitalist party, the Democrats are going down with the ship. If we tie ourselves to the Democrats, this would be like spending our time forcing our way into the bridge of the Titanic. We have to distance ourselves from the failed leadership of the capitalist parties, not ride on their coattails as they fly into the trashcan of history. 

The mood of the working class changes on the basis of events, which are nonlinear. Therefore, while we may not be able to predict when a revolutionary mood will emerge, we can be confident that no matter when it happens, the process will result in a very fast change in the consciousness of the working class when the dam bustst. 

> Before the revolution, it is seen as impossible. After the revolution, it is seen as inevitable.
\- Rosa Luxemburg

Many agree that there is a need to move beyond the DNC. Most who voted for [[Biden]] did it *despite* their opinion of the Democrats, not becuase of it! 

Even in areas where the margin between [[Trump]] and [[Biden]] is razor-thin, we cannot capitulate to the Democratic Party. Their tactic of 'lesser-evilism' only leads to evil winning in the end. We have to instead do our part to create an alternative that isn't evil, that isn't based in the capitalist class. 

### The protest history of the [[Trump]] administration
His administration started with the Womens' March, the largest demonstration in US history, and ended with the BLM movement in nearly every major [[USA|American]] city, with police cars burning from coast to coast. Anyone without a perspective of the immense power of the working class is kidding themselves. 

This shows the true revolutionary potential of the American working class, which has often been doubted by some on the left. Even in the so-called 'imperial core', and after decades of every sector of the ruling class working to dissolve class consiousness and convince everyone that we're all on the same team, most Americans understand intuitivley that whether they're framed as elites, the rich, or corrupt Washington politicians, there is a ruling class, and they don't care about the average American.

## Facing a Climate Catastrophe: We Need a Planned Economy!
### The need for a planned economy
The crisis of [[climate change]] is partially caused by the tragedy of the commons. However, this tragedy only happens when there is a total lack of cooperation and collective ownership of the commons. 

National and international planning of how we use resources is a crucual part of dealing with the current crisis. 

### My intervention
Sorry for the technical problems on my end, but hopefully we've worked those out. 

First of all, I want to thank Antonio for the excellent leadoff, and I wanna thank everyone for coming together for this discussion. I actually graduated with a bachelor's degree in environmental science just last spring, so I think I can lend kind of an inside look into the current sorry state of the way climate change is thought about in our academic establishment. 

The discipline of environmental science, just like all of the sciences, has been developing more and more useful tools to analyze and understand even the most complicated systems of our world. These tools come out of a scientific method and a deeply materialist view of the world, and have greatly helped humanity move forward. 

Our scientists can measure in kilograms the carbon entering our atmosphere, and can predict many of the thousand ways that that carbon will change the climate , but are seemingly terrified at the thought of trying to analyze the development of society! In order to do this, we must turn to Marxism and the philosophy of historical materialism, which seeks to apply scientific methods of analysis to human society. After all, if we can create nuclear energy and send people to the moon, how can we throw up our hands when we're asked to analyze and understand our own society?

But it is precisely this attitude that the bourgeois academics take to the question of climate change. Even the most intelligent professor I encountered was always stumped at the question of how to actually end climate change. Sure, they can tell you what policies would be needed, but never how to actually get them passed! 

Instead of allowing the political nature of this question to emerge, they instead turn to ideas of how we have to make it easier for the free market to swallow change, or how we have to wait endlessly for some new technology to make it profitable to retool our whole economy. This is laughable in a world where our fate is almost sealed already! Often, professors simply don't provide any way forward, leading to cynicism and depression among almost every other student I took classes with. The true failure of the scientific establishment is to raise the question of climate change as a political question. This is why we can rely on that establishment to diagnose our problems, but only the Marxists can provide the solutions. 

As Marxists, we understand that it is the political question of climate change that we have to raise! We have the tools and we have the resources to end this crisis, but we will need revolution and a rationally planned, democratic economy to do it. Anything short of this amounts to the end of global society as we know it. 

Climate crisis is no longer a question of saving loveable species like the whales or the polar bears. Of course, I care about the beauty and well-being of other species, but in my opinion framing the question of stopping environmental destruction as something nice we could do is an outdated way of thinking. The question of how we react to climate change is a question of how many millions of our fellow human being will die in the service of profit. 

If you believe that a system like that isn't the best we can do, don't limit your activism to liberal environmentalism, get involved in the struggle for revolution in our lifetime! Because like it or not, the heavy responsibility of ending capitalism falls to our generation alone. There isn't any time to waste. I'll leave it at that, and thanks again for the great discussion everyone!

## How Revolutionary Socialism can Revive the Labor Movement
The unions are the first line of defense for the workers
### What are the advantages of being in a union?
The median income of union workers is ~$200 higher per week than non-union workers. 

### History of the unions in the US
During the postwar boom, and amidst an attack on the left during McCarthyism, there was a purge of leftists in the [[unions]]. There was a resulting decrease in the scope of the labor movement.

Union density began to decrease in the private sector, and increase in the public sector. 

In 1983, there was 21% union density, down from 40%. Today, the union density is 10.3%! Also, most of the unions today are in the public sector (33% public, 6% private). 

The idea of having a defined-benefit pension is really a thing of the past, because of the decrease in union power. 

### Why did the labor movement decline?
The labor leaders are to blame. Their acceptance of capitalism, and their tactic of [[class independence|class collaborationism]] has doomed them. With their collaborationist perspective, they totally accept the limits of capitalism, and are complicit in squeezing the workers. 

This attitude towards concessions demoralizes the workers, and decreases the popularity of unions among the workers. 

Even when they strike, they follow the letter of the law, which states that you can't prevent scabs from scabbing or occupy property. This leads most strikes to failure. 

The labor leaders, who by the way are part of the [[labor aristocracy]], refuse to split with the Democrats. 

### Is the US working class capable of struggle?
Yes! Just look at our history! Some of the most militant unions in the world have come from the United States. 

### What do the unions need to fight and win?
They need the will to fight, but they also need good leadership, good strategy, and good tactics. 

### Prospects for reformism in 2020
[[reformism]] was only possible during an upswing in capitalism. This enabled the union leadership to appear to be making gains for the workers. That is no longer possible. All those pursuing [[reformism]] and [[class independence|collaborationism]] will eventually be exposed as a fraud. 

### A Marxist union leadership
Marxists start from a perspective totally different from the current leaders. We see that all wealth comes from the [[labor]] of the workers, and that we don't need the capitalists to run society.

Marxists understand the strategy of mass mobilization, unification of workers, solidarity with all other workers, and organizing the unemployed. This has helped many unions with Marxist [[cadre]] in them to greatly expand their influence. 

Marxists also understand that the economic fight is linked with the political fight. The unions need a political apparatus, a [[workers' party]] that can unite their struggles and elevate them. 

## Socialism in our Lifetime! Why We Need Revolutionary Organization
Overall, 750 people registered for this event, from over 40 states and 25 different countries! 

The main theme of this event is the question of how to address the crisis of capitalism. Our perspective cannot be atomized, and cannot be individualistic. It's only when we unite in struggle that we have any power at all. 

This talk is composed of speakers from Mexico, [[Pakistan]], Italy, [[South Africa]], Canada, [[France]], Brazil, Sweden, Morocco, Austria, [[Chile]], and the [[UK]]. 

### Difficult conditions
In **[[Mexico]]**, activists fighting for womens' rights have been shot at and sexually assaulted by police in custody. In **[[Pakistan]]**, activists, including members of the IMT, have been kidnapped and tortured by the state. In [[Brazil]], members have been doxxed and threatened by far-right elements. 

In **[[Canada]]**, Fightback has doubled in size in the last several months, establishing branches even in the traditionally conservative Alberta. They have extended their invitations to the 2021 Marxist Winter School in February.
