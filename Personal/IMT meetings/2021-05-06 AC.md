- Cover class question of the failure of the "small deeds" of [[Narodniks]].

	- Incorporate [[Marxists should use positive demands]] as much as possible when talking to contacts, outside of branch.
	- Inside of branch, we can take a more critical approach.
- Base building vs [[mutual aid]]
	- Doorknocking is base-building, while mutual aid is different. Base building is more broad.
	- Base building is a category of political action. It's fundamentally a [[petty bourgeoisie]] shortcut. 
	- Base building ascribes a revolutionary potential to mutual aid.
