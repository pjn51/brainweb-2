We're discussing the second half of the introduction to [[The Revolutionary Philosophy of Marxism (2018)]]. 

## Reading Questions
1. How can, through [[Marxism]], we understand Human Society?

Through [[historical materialism]]!

2. What is "Historical materialism, and what role does production play in History?

Production creates the material conditons that form the basis for whatever specific form of social organization that grows on top of it. 

3. Describe some of the classes that have arose in history, how they fell and what is the state of class society today?

Well capitalism is charactrerized by the [[proletariat]], the [[petty bourgeoisie]], and the [[bourgeoisie]]. Feudalism was characterized by the aristocracy, the church, and the [[peasantry]]. There are others [[stages of historical development]] as well. 

4. What does the quote: "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please..." Mean?

Marxists are not economic determinists. We understand that it is individuals, and groups of people that actually make history. However, we understand that people don't just choose out of an unlimited set of options. Their options are constrained - and many of these constraints are set by the level of development of the productive forces. 

5. The Dialectical method, what is it? And how do we apply it?

Bada bing, bada boom. [[dialectics]]. We have to look at things in their process of becoming and dying away, not as static states of being. Things are only historically progressive or reactionary in their contexts. 

## Discussion
> “Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind ... when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom. Only conscious organization of social production, in which production and distribution are carried on in a planned way, can lift mankind above the rest of the animal.”  
> - Friedrich Engels

Mass shooting coverage is super good example of [[metaphysics|empirical]] [[idealism]]. "Mass shooters commit these crimes because they have access to AR-15s. / are racist or sexist" The fact is that the [[alienation]] that we experience under [[capitalism]] create the waves of anger and isolation that provide an emotional basis for these kinds of crimes, and our weapons industry provides the material basis. 

I personally love [[ historical materialism]], because I kind of used to be into history in middle and high school, but it was really frustrating how events seemed sort of disconnected. Like the Revolutionary War just happened, and then the civil war happened for other reasons, and then on and on, et cetra, right? It seemed like there was no effort spent studying the forces behind the events, and that's what historical materialism brings to the table. 

Aristocracy
Started as progresive due to their ability to re-invest surplus food towards non-agricultural production
Naturally conservative becase of their reliance on the land.
