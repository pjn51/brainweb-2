# One-on-One
on [[2022-07-20]]
with [[Aerie]]

---
Discussing the break and how it's been, Aerie said that they've been busy and tired, and really isn't looking forward to the weather coming up. They said the break has been nice, but that they've gotten a little out of the rhythm of political life, especially when they got [[COVID-19]] recently. 

We had a discussion on a section of [[What is Marxism? (2015)]] dealing with an introduction to [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[economics]].
