## Reading Questions
1. Why do Marxists study Philosophy?

We study philosophy because it provides a grounding for our work. All our tactical questions stem from overarching strategy, and our strategy stems from our understanding of change, which stems from dialectical materialism. 

2. What are dialectics? How do they differ from [[metaphysics]]?

Dialectics is a method by which we view the world in its fluctuation and change. This is opposed to [[empiricism]] in that dialectics regards everything as a definite stage in a process, or a combination of processes.

3. What are some different dialectical tools? 

==Cognition:== the purpose of cognition is to take in [[data]] and create generalizations. We have to allow for these generalizations to change as new data comes in. 
==Unity of opposites:== there is no up without down, no day without night. Since everything exists in motion towards a new state, nothing can exist without having *something* to be moving away from, and *something* to be moving towards. 
==The transformation of quantity into quality:== at some point, as events add up in a quantitative way, eventually a qualitative change appears. Take the example of water being heated. 

4. What is the relationship between a specific case of something and its universal expression?

Historical necessity expresses itself through accident. Every example of a loaf of bread shapes our generalization about what a loaf of bread is. And the other way around. Our generalizations are shaped by every encounter that we have with a particular expression with something. 

## Discussion
Dialectical materialism helps us to place thinkers in their contexts. There are reasons that certain thinkers appeared when they did.

It also allows us to understand where we should orient to, and how [[class consciousness]] develops. This allows us to predict the future in a way, or at least see the direction things are moving in.

Empiricism attempts to isolate everything in order to examine a single thing in isolation, and claims that objectivity comes from that. However, that removes the thing from all context, and therefore from reality itself.

A good example is to pose the question, "what role do unions play? Progressive or reactionary?" Ask five empricists, and you would get five answers depending on their historical context. At some points in time and space, unions have been a conservative force, but at other times they have played an extremely progressive, even revolutionary role. This is because there are multiple tendencies within each union, and these tendencies become more or less dominant based on a whole host of conditions. 

We start with our senses as the starting point for all knowledge. But our senses are limited so we have to make generalizations in order to live. This is where generalizations and thoughts themselves come from.

We can't avoid preconceptions, there's no way to avoid *a priori* stuff.

We should be clear to base our cognition in materialism as well. The purpose of thought is to make use of and understand the phenomenae that are beyond the grasp of our senses directly. This is the difference between "being in-itself" and "being for-us". We turn phenomenae from things that just exist, into things that we can make use of in order to survive.
