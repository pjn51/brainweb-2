Hayden and I checked in after the long break, and it seems like they're doing well. They mentioned that they've been able to get a lot of fun activities in during the break, and also said that they've been able to make time for reading, which has been refreshing.

We discussed [[The History of Philosophy (2021)]] chapter one on the emergence of philosophy, [[Pythagoras]], and some other stuff. 

Our next meeting is [[2022-08-05 Hayden 1o1]], where we'll discuss the second chapter of the book.
