# ‚úÖ Topics to discuss
- [[What is Money? (2016)#Part four inflation and the gold standard]]
- Freeman and Hayden leaving probationary status
- Bulk bookstore order as a turn towards consolidation
- Library finally open for meeting space
- Convening BC monthly

# ‚úèÔ∏è Notes
- He talked with the Colombian section
- Jacob will either come back as a cadre or he won't. We need to make that distinction clear to him. He effectively hasn't been engaged for a year or more
- Chris seems to be coming along pretty well but has shown a tendency towards cynicism
- I need to ask Freeman if he considers the IMT his political home, or wants to discuss the differences between our group and the other groups that he's participating in. This will determine if he's headed towards full membership or an extended probation / moving away from us. 

# üóì Next meeting
