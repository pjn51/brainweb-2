# ðŸ“° News updates
- 52nd anniversary of the murder of [[Fred Hampton]], assassinated by police in 1969. 
- Election in [[Honduras]] 
- Downfall of the Modi government

# â˜­ Recently unveiled documents from the Russian revolution
- Themes of bureaucratic creep, international solidarity.
- Scarcity was a huge issue
- This explains [[Trotsky]]'s ideas in [[Terrorism and Communism (1920)]]. 
	- Need for drastic centralization due to circumstances imposed by imperialist encirclement and counter-revolution
- Spinoza: it's not our job to laugh or weep, but to understand
- Stalinists create a false dichotomy of total defense of every aspect of the USSR, versus calling for the restoration of capitalism
- In [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]], Trotsky makes the point that the enemies of communism are very well aware of the material failings of the USSR, while Stalinist organizations refuse to educate themselves in order to not make the same mistakes. 
- In a strike, workers still need food and commodities but do not produce any. We can see that in a revolution, this imbalance is much more extreme and we ought to expect some decline in the productivity of labor
- Things to be optimistic about
	- Our working class is immensely stronger than theirs was
	- Therefore, no real space for internal conter-revolution
	- Massively improved living conditions

# ðŸ“¥ Overview of branch roles and duties
- Getting to the point where we should formalize leadership
- Officer positions
	- Branch secretary (most consolidated / experienced, makes sure everything gets done, communicates with national, takes responsibility for overall development of the branch)
	- Finance officer (accounts for dues and money from and for paper sales, communicates with national treasurer, explains political meaning behind financial practices)
	- Press officer (plans and orders papers and other literature, works closely with the finance officer)
	- These are guidelines, not iron laws. Just suggestions from national based on what's worked in other places and in the past. 
	- At some point as we grow, we will have BC meetings where the officers will meet to handle organizational stuff, we aren't at that level yet
- Elections
	- Usually the outgoing group of officers will propose a new "slate:" a whole leadership team of all the officers. Anyone else can propose an alternative slate, and then we'll vote on it a week later. 
	- We do this to make sure that the leadership is cohesive at all times. If there was a 55% vs 45% split in the organization, it would be better to give control to the majority, try out their ideas, and then re-assess instead of having the organization become totally ineffective for a whole period of time. This is the fundamental to [[democratic centralism]]. 
- Meeting duties
	- Chair: facilitates stack and keeps the meeting on track, facilitates and ensures voting on agenda and minutes
	- Minutes: this person keeps track of what the agenda was, who was present or absent at each meeting, and who spoke in each discussion. No need to keep notes on what was said
	- Benefits of doing it like this: training the members, facilitating effective meetings
- Need for overall discipline
	- We aren't a discussion group, we aren't a book club
	- Org is fundamentally a political weapon that we want to provide to the working class
	- This weapon must be sharp and effective to be worthy of their use
