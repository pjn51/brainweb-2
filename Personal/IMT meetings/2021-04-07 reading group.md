## Reading Questions
> 1.  What or who was Lenin addressing in the writing of this book?

[[Lenin]] wrote this just before the second congress of the [[Comintern]] in 1920. This was after [[Bolsheviks]] had conqured power, and defeated the reactionaries in the Russian Civil War. He was now turning internationally, and looking to the revolutionaries in western Europe. Lenin was always an internationalist, and believed that the Russian revolution could only be completed with aid from a more developed socialist country. Therefore, he put a lot of emphasis on helping revolutionaries in the more advanced capitalist countries find success. 

This is why this work is so important. Here, Lenin is talking directly to us - revolutionaries working in an advanced capitalist country with a tradition of bourgeois democracy. He's trying to take the main lessons of the experience the Bosheviks had, and give it to us so that we can learn from their mistakes and their correct decisions. 

- [[democratic centralism]]
	- [[dialectics]] of centralism vs democracy
	- Lack of accountability -> most active members determine all decisions
	- Lack of democracy -> loudest members determine all decisions

> 2. What groups and structures did the Bolsheviks rely on to stay in power after the revolution? Why were they needed?  

- Support of the advanced workers
- [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]
- Needed because
	- Interntional [[bourgeoisie]]
	- Small-scale production ([[peasantry]])
	- Force of habit

>3. Lenin says the Bolsheviks' theory grew in relation to a whole series of events and phases that the Russian movement went through. What sorts of phases has the [[USA|American]] movement gone through in our lifetime?  

- Iraq War
- Occupy Wall St.
- Rise of Bernie and the development of [[DSA]] 
- Ferguson
- [[June 2020 uprising]]

>4. What can we learn from the various stages that the Bolsheviks went through before October 1917?

- Dynamic size of the bolsheviks
- Rising to prominence, falling into small circles again, and still maintaining the struggle
- Large parties with unclarified ideas burst apart while the small bolsheviks rose to power
- Shows need to thinking about the motion of things beyond the immediate facts
