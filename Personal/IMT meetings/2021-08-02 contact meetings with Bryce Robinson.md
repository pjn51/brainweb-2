		- Pay monthly dues
		- Sell the paper
	- What is the revolutionary party?
		- Our DNA is found in our program, methods, and traditions
		- Provide the foundation for any organization
		- We have [[cadre]] as a skeleton upon which newer members can depend
	- The ones and twos
		- Our job is to patiently explain to contacts and new members
		- We want to gather those who are open to our ideas (few at first, more later)
		- By spending the time to establish 500 fully trained cadres, we can gain thousands very quickly later
		- Quality > quantity at this time
	- The importance of theory and education
		- This is how we gain strength as [[cadre]]
		- Understanding the *method* of [[Marxism]] >>> memorization of positions
		- We have an education plan for first-year comrades
	- Orientation to the working class
		- We want to be talking to the working class, in whatever organizations the class finds itself
		- Balanced mindset, not rushing into things we cannot make use of
		- The [[Democratic Party]] is *not* a mass organization of the [[proletariat]]
	- The internet and social media
		- Common sense stuff
- Part II: The organizational structure of the IMT
	- [[democratic centralism]]
		- Cycle of debate and action
		- Membership is accountable to leadership and vice versa
	- The basic structure
		- Branch -> CC elected at National Congress, sends delegates to World Congress where IEC is elected
		- Branch elects BC to run daily affairs, CC elects EC to run daily affairs, IEC elects IS
		- Officers are appointed by leadership at all levels to handle tasks like finance, outreach, etc
	- The National Congress
		- Happening in early October in Pitt. 
		- Welcome to attend if you decide to go through with membership
	- The CC, CC contacts, the EC, Officers, and subcommittees
		- The Central Committee can appoint various officers and subcommittees to deal with things as needed
		- At a local level, we can have a Press Secretary, Branch Secretary, Contacts Officer, and Finance Officer as needed
		- Since we're small, not much need for formal positions. I'm handling finance and contacts right now. [[JC|Josh]] is handling paper sales.
