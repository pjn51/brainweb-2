# One-on-one with JT
`TAGS:`

---
- My points / questions
	- How to deal with hecklers
	- Value of in-person with less members, or remote with more
		- In-person is very important. We have to build *in Seattle*.
		- Membership isn't passive, comrades should either attend branch in SEA or build their own branch
		- Branch should really be in person
		- [[JT]] used to drive 1 hr to go to branch every week.
	- Writing for SR
		- I should pick a topic
		- Propose topic to the editorial board at editoral@socialistrevolution.org
		- They will respond after some time with feedback and request an outline, or give another idea
		- A member of the editorial board will follow up with me
	- How many Nat. Congress docs?
		- US perspectives and org res are gonna be on BDC
		- We can prioritize the new constitution and program which will probably take a single meeting
	- Number of delegates for SEA branch
		- One delegate per three members
		- We can have one delegate
		- Coordinate flights
		- Select delegates out of the pool of those who can attend
	- See questions in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]] notes.
		- Cannon had strengths but tended to practice [[Zinoviev]]ism (solving political problems organizationally)
		- Historical necessity of the Thermidor = False
			- The bureaucrat's role in production was created by the workers themselves
			- The workers in the USSR were the motor force of progress, not the bureaucrats
		- Historical necessity of [[feudalism]] = True
			- Led to re-formation of national boundaries
			- Aristocracy concentrated surplus for use by the ruling class, allowing for reinvestment
		- I should read *Will There Be A Slump* by [[Ted Grant]]
		- Capitalism today is not so secure
			- Lack of [[Stalinism]] today is a weakess of capitalism today
			- Workers more numerous than ever today
			- We can rebuild the forces of Marxism quite fast since we have a long legacy and lessons learned
