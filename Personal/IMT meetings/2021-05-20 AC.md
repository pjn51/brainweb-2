# Marx Was Right Forum - 15m 
Interventions: PN, [[JT]], JM, JW

- JT
	- Initially set up as a reading group / caucus to anchor [[DSA]] interventions
	- Developed into a forum with roundtable discussion
	- Now its a vehicle for training new members, basically a public event
	- Leadoffs are meant to be given by intermediate members, so that a new layer can be trained up
		- This has been lacking lately, and we might retool the meeting to give new members more opportunities
	- Possibly moving towards an inter-organization event or something
		- Would other non-DSA orgs be able to bring in fresh layers? Possibly not.
	- 15 organic contacts, mostly from Pheonix
- JT on planning meeting
	- We are encouraged to attend on Tuesdays 7pm every week leading up to the event
- Possibility of creating reading groups for contacts
	- Short, intro readings
	- Helps contact work scale well
