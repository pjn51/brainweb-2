# IEC recap (leadoff by TT)
- Over 100 attendees between IEC members and invites.
- We may have been wrong about the likelihood of war in [[Ukraine]], but we were certainly right about [[inflation]] and generalized crisis. 
- We are too small to take advantage of this situation but we have the opportunity to grow. It is our task to link up with the radicalizing youth, and strengthen the forces of [[Marxism]]. 
- Sales report
	- [[The History of Philosophy (2021)]] is the bestselling book we've had. The leader of Unision (largest [[UK]] union) loves this book and is distributing it in the union. 
	- IDoM magazine: multiple translations ongoing. *American Socialista* has been selling in countries that we don't have members in, which is exciting. 
- We build the organization through our theoretical analysis and clear ideas. 
- [[Alan Woods]] is working on a book on Marxist philosophy at the moment. 
- July 24-26: International Marxist University. We should plan for watch parties, aggregates, etc.
