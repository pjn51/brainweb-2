# ‚úÖ Topics to discuss
- [[What is Money? (2016)#Part five the future of money]]
- Value of student work
- General branch stuff

# ‚úèÔ∏è Notes
- [[substitutionalism]] is an easy trap
- Chris is pessimistic on the student work
- There *are* radical students. We should make an effort to reach them
- Are students more valuable than workers?
	- Students tend to have more free time, and naturally integrate into the working class after graduation
	- Students can make good activists because of this
- We're almost a medium sized branch at this point 
- Contacts is a more important measure of success than paper sales or positive conversations
- I should discuss the issue of sympathizer status with Jacob very delicately, since he might be resistant to that because of his past engagement - regardless of the fact that he isn't playing the role of an active member
- We need to have a discussion with Freeman on his feelings about the branch
	- Somebody should read [[Does Maos Combat Liberalism Actually Combat Liberalism (2019)]] with him
	- Every comrade has baggage that accelerate or slow down development in certain areas, Freeman seems to have an attachment to [[Maoism]] that could represent a bit of political immaturity
- There may be a little [[workerism]] at play, where we confuse leftist activist milieu with the working class
