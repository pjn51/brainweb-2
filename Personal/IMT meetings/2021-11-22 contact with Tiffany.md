# ✏️ Notes
Tiffany made contact with us at a tabling session, and wanted to hear about how our work pertained to the local and national situation. 

She is a nurse, and acted as a medic during the [[June 2020 uprising]]. She seemed to be in general agreement about the need for an organized, disciplined revolutionary organization, and seemed willing to focus on education as a method to develop the beginnings of that. 

She expressed agreement on our position towards the [[Democratic Party]], and said that Bernie was a disappointment. 

She is also indigenous, and wanted to know what our perspectives on that struggle were, so I decided to recommend a discussion of Fightback's indigenous struggle document for our next contact meeting, which will be on [[2021-12-03]].
