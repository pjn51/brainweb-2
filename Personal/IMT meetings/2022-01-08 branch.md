# 📥 2022 branch goals and 2021 review
- 2021 review
	- Five new members, with three either leaving or stepping back
	- High turnover but high growth relative to our size and activities
	- Sold $168 worth of political material, including 89 papers and one booklet. 
	- Our average dues rate was $28 per comrade as of December, and we sent a total of $2,300 to the national center
	- May seem like a lot of money for national, but our CC contact (Jake) has spent 50+ hours helping the leadership of this branch and even flew out here to meet with us in September. Money also helps comrades across the world conduct operations in difficult conditions.
