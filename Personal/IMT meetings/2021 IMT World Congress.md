# Introduction
The [[IMT]] has a World Congress every two years where the organization elects a political leadership to the International Secretariat, and votes on a political document, the [[IMT World Perspectives (2021)]]. There is also a discussion on Marxist [[philosophy]], and an organizational discussion of the work across the sections.

This is a four day event, lasting from [[2021-07-24]] until [[2021-07-27]]. Unfortunately for me, it is in [[UK]] time, so the sessions start at 5:30 AM and end at 1:00 PM. 

# Political discussion
I appreciate the many amendments that were put forward. I think it shows health for there to be some disagreement or range of opinion within an organization, and I'm glad to see that there is healthy debate happening on an international level. 

On the first day, we heard from a lot of speakers including [[Rob Sewell]] and [[Alan Woods]]. There were some moving comments from a comrade in [[Pakistan]] about how the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[state]] is attempting to provoke violence against women. 

Overall, I think the diagnosis is that we're in for a protracted crisis and period of struggle, since there is no revolutionary leadership ready to take power, combined with a deep crisis of [[capitalism]]. 

## The situation in Cuba
We also heard some support for the revolution in [[Cuba]], and an analysis of why we should still support Cube even though it is a deformed [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]. The message to revolutionaries in Cuba was to take the fight against the counter-revolution into their own hands, and not leave it to the bureaucrats in the Cuban state. 

There was some debate on the Cuban issue, with a speaker arguing that we should remember that our ultimate position towards the Cuban bureaucracy is that they should be overthrown and a healthy workers' democracy be instituted. 

# Development report
We now have over 4,000 members worldwide, an increase of over 1,000 in the last 12 months. 

## The IDOM site
The website has gotten over 3 million pageviews in the last 12 months. The most popular articles are "What is historical materialism," "Bolshevism," and others. Published within the last year, the number one article is about [[Hegel]], the article in defense of the Cuban revolution, an article about the GME fiasco on wall st, and the critique of [[Federici]]. 

People evidently come to our website for ideas and substance. That's our strength and the source of our growth.

Website visits are actually down 19% since last year, which is likely due to Google and Facebook taking measures against leftwing pages. This highlights the value of a printed press that is run independently of the capitalists. 

## WellRed books
In the past 12 months, sales have doubled from 43,000 to 90,000 pounds. Books sold have increased from 5,200 to 11,500. 

Four books have been published in the last year, by [[Lenin]], [[Engels]], [[Rob Sewell]], and [[Marx]]. 

Two new full-timers for the bookstore have been hired using this new money. 

Over 7,000 copies of the *In Defense of Marxism* magazine have been printed as the publication is relaunched. Revenue will be used to distribute subsidies to lower-income counties. 

## The International Center
Six new full-timers have been hired. Tasks for the international organization have increased faster than the IC can keep up. There are at least 19 countries where we have sympathizers or small groups with no national section built. Thse countries include [[India]], [[Myanmar]], [[Ukraine]], [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], and [[Haiti]]. 

They're proposing that we accept the groups from [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as sections during this Congress. 

## Sections around the world
### Brazil
In [[Brazil]], membership increased by 29%. 260 comrades today, up from 187 before [[COVID-19]]. Their target is 300 members by the end of the year. 

They were the first to raise the "Fora Bolsonaro" slogan, at a time where all the sects predicted [[fascism]]. However, they refused to support our slogan. That slogan has found a strong echo and become a mass demand. 

The campaign gathered over 1,000 signatures. The launch meeting on July 10 saw more than 500 attendees. 

### Russia
In [[Russia]], until a few years ago, we only had 15 or so comrades in Leningrad. After discussion, we won over a group of young revolutionaries in the Revolutionary Workers' Party. Today we have 125 comrades spread over all 11 time zones. They have multiple websites, an active YouTube channel, and a paper with a print run of 5,000. Supporting all this are only 2 full-timers. 

Their work includes study circles, trade union struggle intervention, and work within the Communist Party. Within the CP, there is friction between the old leadership and new feelings of radicalism among the ranks. Our calls for a return to the traditions of the [[Bolsheviks]] have drawn attention. 

A layer on the left is starting to regard us as a focal point. 

### Greece
33% increase in membership in [[Greece]].

### Switzerland
36% increase in membership in [[Switzerland]]. 158 comrades. 

### Pakistan
40% growth rate in [[Pakistan]]. Very difficult conditions this year. Went from 504 in January to 714 in July! 77 branches across the country. 81 comrades are women. Their paper has a distribution of 1,200 monthly. 

### Austria
47% increase in membership in [[Austria]]. Went from 111 to 165 comrades. 

### Canada 
50% membership growth across [[Canada]]. Went from around 200 to 425 since January 2020. Went from 15 to 33 branches. 1,150 went to the Montreal Winter School. 300 participated in the first Western Canada Winter School. They have branches in all major cities at this point. They're the largest revolutionary group in Canadian history at this point. Their goal is 500 by december 2021. 

We're the only force left on the university campuses. 17 university groups so far. We played a leading role in the Ontario work-stoppage campaign in the spring, and are sending representatives to all major strikes and labor actions, but aren't big enough to be seen as a real force in the Canadian [[proletariat]] yet. Interventions are secondary to cadre development. 

### Mexico 
75% increase in membership in [[Mexico]]. 138. 

### Britain
75% membership growth in the [[UK]]. Went from 398 in January 2020 to 700 members today. 23 full-timers. Fifteen branches in London alone! Youth work accounts for 80% of growth. Socialist Appeal groups on 40 campuses. Their goal is 1,000 by April. Socialist Appeal is become the most visible Marxist force in the country, which is paying off. This profile comes with negatives, reflected in the proscription of Socialist Appeal by the [[Labour Party (UK)]] leadership. This reflects their fear at our growing influence. Main focus remains [[cadre]] formation from the advanced youth.

The banning of Socialist Appeal has caused a massive increase in publicity, coming along with many new contacts inside and outside of Labour. 

### Germany 
77% membership growth in [[Germany]]. The leading member of the section passed away during COVID-19, but the members are honoring him by building the organization. They went from 58 to 103 members since the start of COVID-19. This is mainly from youth work. 

Their goal is 300 members by 2023. This goal will require iron determination, and will hopefully motivate the group to achieve it. 

### USA 
86% growth rate in the [[USA]]. 201 comrades before COVID-19, around 370 now. Now have 11 full timers, 33 branches across 71 cities. Growth is strong in the south. Comrades intervened in over 100 demonstrations during [[June 2020 uprising]]. Website contact submissions have gone from a couple dozen a month to two dozen a week. Target is 500 comrades by June 2022. 

### Indonesia 
Went from 28 to 70 comrades, 150% growth rate in [[Indonesia]]. This was despite serious constraints due to COVID-19 and political situation. 

### Italy
In [[Italy]], 324 members before COVID-19, today we have 365 in 31 branches across 21 cities. Ten full-timers and multiple offices. Comrades have gained from taking a hard line against [[identity politics]], with over 300 contacts coming from these campaigns. The work among the [[unions]] is going well here. 

### Sweden 
119 comrades in [[Sweden]]. 

### France 
105 comrades in [[France]]. 

### Spain
98 comrades in [[Spain]].
