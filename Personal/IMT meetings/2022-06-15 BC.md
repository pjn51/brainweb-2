# Planning the next month
- I expect to miss at least branches next month. I'm moving, my parents are coming to town, and I have a concert. 
- I am closing on a townhome June 27, and will be moving throughout the month of July. Additionally, my parents are coming to visit for a week. I cannot guarantee my attendance at any branches or reading groups that month, since lots of our moving is going to have to happen on the weekends. I can continue to do OoO duties with [[HM]] and Aerie. 
- [[JC|Josh]] is going to be gone June 17 until July 3. 
- The real question is for Chris: do you think you have the bandwidth to be the driving comrade for basically a month and really drive these branch meetings? If not...
	- We could pause reading group to give people more free time.
	- We could even pause branch if we really have to.]

# Who should Josh start shadowing?

# Freeman's status
- Has Chris met with him since our last discussion?





# ðŸ—“ Next meeting
