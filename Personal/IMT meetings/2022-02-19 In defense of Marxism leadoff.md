# Leadoff on "in defense of Marxism", 
A portion of [[2022-02 Marxist Winter School]]

---
Fred Weston, the editor of IDoM and member of the IEC of the [[IMT]] gives this leadoff on the general importance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory for the revolutionary movement. 

He begins with the question, "[[What is Marxism?]]" He explains the various components, and begins with an explanation of [[dialectics]]. He explains that even today, science relies on dialectics. He uses some material from [[Trotsky]]'s explanation of dialectics in his work, [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]], particularly the section "The ABC of materialist dialectics." 

He explains how small changes move towards tipping points, including with the climate of our planet. This ties into the idea that [[Quantity transforms into quality]].
