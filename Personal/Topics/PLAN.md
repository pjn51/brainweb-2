This is a method for balancing the things I need to be doing as part of my job hunt. 


**Apply** to jobs (7-10 jobs per week)
**[[networking|Network]]** with professionals (1 formal event per week) and set up one-on-one meetings. 

# Practice
I should be continually pulling ideas from my [[research ideas]] and making small projects. See my [[personal kanban]] for an organizational structure. I should do this around 8-10 hours per week, aka two hours per workday. I actually refer to this as "Create" in my plan. 

# Learn 
Learn new skills for 5-6 hours per week. This means one hour per workday.

# Apply
I should apply to around 7-10 jobs per week, I've dedicated 40 minutes per workday for this.
