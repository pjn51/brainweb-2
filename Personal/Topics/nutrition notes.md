# Nutrition Notes
`LINKS:` [[Crohn's disease]]


---
## 5-14-20 meeting with Dr. Ervin
### LDN
3 mg would be a good starting dose for me, tapered up by 1 mg / week.  Priority 2 / phase 1

If there’s some intolerance with that dose, there are other options for me. 

We would expect to see results of less inflammation after 3 weeks. Usually LDN is better for keeping inflammation down than for decreasing it on its own. 

Tumeric 2 caps 2x daily. We will see if they turn my poop orange, and if they help my inflammation. 

Cost: $90 for 3 months. 

She recommends a pharmacy in Mt. Vernon. They are local experts on LDN.
LDN is an opioid, and only other opioids. It’s ok to have overlap with the [[prednisone]]. 
In fact, it would be nice to use the pred to lower the inflammation, and then the LDN could keep it down. 

Some describe the feeling like a flare is about to start when they increase their dose. 

### Gluten connection
A lot of people my age experience weight gain after excluding gluten (3 weeks). This could be because of increased absorption, so maybe I should try this. 

Even if I don’t have a reaction to gluten, there could still be a connection. 

### Psyllium husks priority 3 / phase 2
This is a low-irritation form of fiber that could help me have solid stools. 
It’s very cheap as well. 

Don’t take this before 30 min of anything else (food, pills, etc) or 2 hrs after. 

### Supplements
She recommends injectable B12 or liquid

Digestive enzymes before meals, but not the ones I have

Collagen 2x daily with medication. Priority 1 / phase 1

### Making my own bread
If I can't get off gluten, it would be better to eat homemade sourdough than processed gluten.

We should seek to minimize gluten if we can’t cut it out entirely. 

### Probiotics
A future possibility

Message in 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and then we will meet later. 

## 6-11-20 meeting w. Dr. Ervin
### Medication vs diet
Having your diet under control helps people feel in control of their situation. The same is true for natural therapeutics. LDN can take time to come into effect, which makes detecting effects more difficult. 

Typically, people feel a little more upbeat and energetic at the start of treatment. 
Being on an anti-inflammatory diet could help kickstart LDN. 

Cut out gluten as much as possible. Stick to veggies and meat. 

Start taking turmeric !! 

Psyllium husks can help clear the inflammation, so they could help me ease off the prednisone. Between meals! 

The “healing process” is a 21-day process. It takes 4-6 weeks to really start to recover. This is the timeframe. If we don’t see changes in this time, we can shift doses from 3mg to 4.5 mg. 

Next meeting: 11 am, July 9th. 

## 7/9 Meeting w. Dr. Ervin
We’re going to talk today about the microbiome. Variety is the key for supporting a diverse microbiome. Fermented stuff is good because it's probiotic. We want both ==probiotics== and prebiotics in my diet. I should get the alive pickles in the refrigerated section. 

Probiotic pills are good for a crisis, but diet is better for getting probiotics. We are basically working with the bacteria that I was born with, and it’s a lot easier to stimulate the existing colonies than to implant a new one. 

Seeds and nuts are also good for stimulating certain varieties of bacteria. Hummus is a good option. Try to replace chips or pretzels with celery or carrots. If we go with bread, use sourdough bread. Peanuts support multiple species of bacteria in the microbiome. 

I could add chia seeds to my greek yogurt. It’s best to let it sit in the yogurt for a while to get the seeds soft. Hemp seed is more expensive, but very healthy and good for the microbiome. Flax seed is super useful, but many people don’t like how it tastes. 

When adding these to my diet, start slowly. If you have too much, it will cause gas or bloating. 

There are lots of health benefits from garlic and onion in terms of inflammation. 
Turmeric: some people need short bursts of turmeric and then take a break. Others need constant supply. 5-6 weeks is a good time period for deeper healing with the turmeric. 

Priorities:
- Try flax seed and see if you like it. Hydrate it to make it easier to eat. 
- Get living probiotic pickles (found in the refrigeration section).
- Put chia seeds in greek yogurt.
- Take vitamin D

## 2-5-21 meeting with VirginiaMason RD Ashley Judson
- I should remove dairy
	- Not greek yogurt due to the probiotic benefit. Not everyone can have it but I should if I can.
- App for food logging
	- CaraCare designed for GI patients. 
- Fluids
	- Some aloe bevs are good, some are bad. Make sure it actually has the aloe gel. Get the ones that are thicker and have less sugar. 
- Low fiber seems to be working for me at the moment. 
- We'd like to be back at the plce where fiber is ok
- Protein
	- Protein is the most important right now.
	- At every meal or snack I need a good protein source
	- This will help reduce inflammation, increase weight. 
	- Creamy nut butters can help bump up the protein and add a little fat which can be helpful.
	- 4-6 oz per meal
- ==Calcium==
	- I *need* to be taking this. 
	- Dairy alts
		- Tofu is one of the best plant sources (comparable to milk)
		- Dark leafy greens have calcium (spinach, kale, arugula, chard)
		- Salmon and eggs have calcium
		- Fortified foods
			- Greek yog
			- Non-dairy milk is sometimes fortified with calcium and vitamin D (check and see if our oat milk has it)
	- If my stools are formed, I can stick with a capsule
- ==Fat== and Omega-3 are good for reducing inflammation. 
	- Big fishes! 
	- Creamy nut butters, ideally almond butter
	- Chia seeds or flax seed. Soak the chia. 
	- Plant sources of fat are good, like avocado. 
	- Limit animal sources of fat like cheese or butter or fatty meat. Except for salmon, that's an exception. 
- ==Antioxidants==
	- Sweet potatoes
	- Fruits without large exposed seeds. Strawberries or blueberries might be ok
- Carbs can give lots of calories
- ==Red meats== are the toughest for our systems to digest. 
	- Tend to cause inflammation with Crohn's
	- Choose leanest possible
	- Only 1x per week. 
- Spicy is dangerous
- ==Probiotics==
	- Kimchi is tricky. Spicy = bad, but probiotic = good. It doesn't really count as a raw vegetable. 
	- Kombucha for probiotics
	- Not great evidence for supplements, look to foods first
	- Tempeh is good too as a probiotic-rich protein
	- Fermented cheeses (non-dairy) can be found in the deli section
- A shake or smoothie could be a good addition between meals. 
	- Greek yogurt, nut butter or peanut butter, and fruit.
	- I could try blended spinach. This would be more tolerated than eating it raw normally. 
	- Chia seeds or flax could go in too. 
- Orgain shakes or powders
	- This is a good product that I could use as a protein base
	- Vega is also good for a protein base
- Long term
	- We need to get me to a place where I can tolerate fiber
	- Fiber can actually reduce inflammation
	- We can move crohn's into remission
- Takeaway
	- Increase salmon, nut butter, smoothies, probiotics, hydration (8-12 cups daily)
	- Maintain greek yogurt
	- Decrease red meat
	- Exclude animal fats, dairy
