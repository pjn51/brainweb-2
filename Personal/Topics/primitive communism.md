This is the stage of development that characterized human society for the first hundred thousand years of its development or so. By far the longest-running stage, this mode of production (if you could really even call it production) was based on hunter-gatherer methods.

Since humanity was generally nomadic during this time due to the need to follow migrating animals, and there was no way to store wealth long-term, there was no ability to create and re-invest [[surplus value]]. This prevented the development of class society.
