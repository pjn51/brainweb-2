# Magnetic Resonance Enterography

Magnetic resonance enterography, or MRE, is an MRI technique used to evaluate bowel wall features in the small and large intestine. It is used for analysis of gastrointestinal inflammation in [[Crohn's disease]]. 

Without insurance, this procedure can cost $1,800. 

I had a MRE on [[2021-01-05]] and again on [[2021-06-16]]. The first time, I was feeling really weak due to a lengthy flare, and I had a terrible time drinking the contrast. I even threw up inside the machine when they added the IV contrast! But the second time, I did much better. I think the best way to do it is to just chug the contrast in little sprints, rather than try and sip it like I did the first time. Gotta remember that for next time. 

See my notes from [[2021-07-21 with Dr. Zisman]] for a discussion of the results of these two procedures.
