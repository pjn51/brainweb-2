# Empiricism
---
Empiricism represents a trend in [[philosophy]] and science towards viewing things in isolation in order to understand them better. It's more dogmatic varieties tend to ascribe unchanging qualities to all phenomena. 

However, [[Change is omnipresent]], and this perspective will eventually fail when it is pushed beyond its limits. 

In politics, a view of empiricism can cause deviations from the [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective in two directions: [[Empiricism can lead to opportunism]] or [[Empiricism can lead to sectarianism]]. 

The inverse of empiricism is probably subjective idealism. [[Woods describes Hume as a subjective idealist]], saying his ideas are "empiricism turned inside out." 

A huge issue with empiricism is its inability to generate hypotheses. How can you generate a hypothesis from a collection of unconnected facts? [[Good hypotheses are essential]], and this attitude stunts scientific progress.

Having moved past the shortcomings of empiricism, [[Dialectical materialism represents the height of modern analysis]].
