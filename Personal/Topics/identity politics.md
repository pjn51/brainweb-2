# Identity Politics
`TAGS`: 

---
Identity politics represents the tendency towards looking at political issues such as racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression from a standpoint focusing on individual identity, inclusion, and representation.

From a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective, identity politics represents a political movement of the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. It is rooted in individual action and [[moralism]], failing to see the various forms of oppression as tools weilded by the [[bourgeoisie]] against the [[proletariat]]. Instead, the supporters of identity politics tend to believe that through representation and equal access to opportunity, we can rectify these historic injustices without directly challenging [[capitalism]].
