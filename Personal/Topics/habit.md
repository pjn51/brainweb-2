# Introduction
Habits are the foundation of a lifestyle. By focusing on small, attainable goals and building them up into habits, they can help me increase my [[productivity]].

For a long time, I kept track of
- Medicine
- Stretch
- Litter
- Log meals
- Work out
- Clean
- Leave house

Now I don't keep track of most habits. I think that I tend to do them as consistently even when I don't keep track of them, and it's a pain to do so. 

# Habits and ethics
I feel like my current habit tracker could be called a very [[deontology|deontological]] system. I have certain duties I must fufill, and that determines how 'good' my day is going. However, I think that [[virtue ethics]] seem to be more compelling as an ethical system, so maybe I should try to track my virtues. 

5-14-21: Looking back on this, I don't like virtue ethics anymore, and I think it would be very weird to track 'my virtues,' whatever that would even mean. 

Recently I've taken a step back from tracking my habits so rigorously, and I don't feel that I've slipped out of them. It seems to me that tracking them daily is a bit overkill.
