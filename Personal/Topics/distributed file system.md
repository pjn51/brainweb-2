# Distributed File Systems
`TAGS:`

## Introduction [^1]
A distributed file system, or DFS, is a file system that is distributed between multiple file servers or multiple locations. This allows programs to access or store isolated files just like local ones, and allows programmers to access files from any computer. 

The main purpose of DFS is to allow multiple users to share their data and resources by using a common file system. 

These systems are a common topic of the field of [[data engineering]]. 

## Examples
[[Hadoop]] is a group of open-source software services that rely on DFS.
