 # Life Balance ☯️
---
I feel like there are three main components that I'm trying to balance in my life. 

- Political development
- Personal development
- Interpersonal development

## Political development
I really care about the [[IMT]] and I feel like I'm really invested in becoming [[cadre]]. But at the same time, I feel like this aspect of my life could really come to dominate the other three so I think I have to keep it in check. 

Levels of development
- Current
	- Attend branch (2 hours per week)
	- Attend reading group / tabling (2 hours per week)
	- Attend Branch Committee (2 hours every other week)
	- Attend one-on-ones (2 hours every other week per meeting)
- Possible
	- Attend Western Regional Committee (2 hours every other week)

## Personal development
I want to become more developed and well-rounded as a person. I feel like my political development often gets in the way of this. I want to find healthy ways to express myself, which I often struggle to do. And I want to gain more skills and explore more hobbies that could help me become more well rounded.

I guess this section also includes developing [[data science]] skills since I view getting a job and becoming financially independent as a serious step towards personal development. 

## Interpersonal development
First and foremost, I want to maintain and deepen my relationship with [[Eylen]]. Often I take our relationship for granted and treat it more as a constant in my life rather than something that requires care. 

I also want to strengthen my social skills and make more friends so that I have my own network that isn't just Eylen's friends.
