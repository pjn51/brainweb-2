Economics is the (usually [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]) study of the economy. Since [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], the mainstream trends in economics represent apologia for [[capitalism]] and a justification of the status quo, either through outright reactionary positions or a kind of technocratic [[reformism]]. 

From a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective, economics is an important field to understand. This is because [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]] centers the production and reproduction of society, which can only be understood through economic processes. 

Furthermore, there are lots of economic conditions for a [[socialism|socialist]] society. [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]].
