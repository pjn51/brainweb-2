# Introduction
Spain is a country in southern Europe. 

## 1936
In 1936, workers seized power almost spontaneously. Across Catalonia, [[Anarchism|anarchists]] in the [[CNT-FAI]] controlled many towns and villages. 

At the same time, there was a [[fascism|fascist]] movement led by Franco. Because of this movement, and as a tactic to prevent revolution, the liberals advocated for a "Popular Front" against fascism. The [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Communist Party of Spain agreed to work in this coalition, and declared that there must first be a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] revolution in Spain before workers could take control. [[Stalin]] and his allies were in favor of this because the [[Russia|USSR]] was seeking to strengthen its bonds with [[France]] and the [[UK]] in the face of a risihg threat in [[Germany]]. 

This [[opportunism|class collaborationist]] attitude was the downfall of the movement overall.
