# Introduction
Color represents the visual categorization of wavelengths of visual light. This is a big element of [[art]]. After we outline and shade, the next step is to color. 

# Color Theory
This is the logical foundation for organizing color, for both technical and psychological effect. 

## History of Color Theory
The first to talk about this were artists in the 1400s, including Leonardo da Vinci, but the theory didn't really develop until the 1800s. 

The theory is built around the idea of primary colors, which were first thought to be red, yellow, and blue. However, in the late 1800s scientists discovered that it was really red, green, and blue that made up the basic colors that we percieve. 

# The Color Wheel

This is a visual representation of the primary colors, and the combinations of primary colors that yield secondary and tertiary colors. 

# Color Harmony
Harmony is a dynamic equilibrium of stimulation. Not enough color complexity leads to under-stimulation and a dull image. Too much complexity is recieved by the viewer as chaos, and causes too much stimulation. 

Colors that are side-by-side on the color wheel can look nice together. These are known as *analogous* colors. Two colors that are on the opposite side of the color wheel can also be nice. These are known as *complimentary* colors.

# Color Context
Colors can appear quite differently based on what colors are surrounding them.
