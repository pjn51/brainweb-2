# Democratic Centralism
---
Democratic centralism is an organizing principle for many left-wing organizations. [[Freedom of debate enables unity of action]]. This method of organization is entirely distinct from the idea of bureaucratic centralism, which is what the [[Comintern]] degenerated into after [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]].

This method of organization takes [[The dialectic of unity and dissent]] into account, balancing the need to have both. 

# Freedom of debate
[[Democratic centralism requires free debate]]. It was this aspect of democratic centralism that was eroded by the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]]. 

# Unity of action
[[Democratic centralism enables unity of action]]. This tends to alienate the [[petty bourgeoisie]], since [[The petty bourgeoisie prefers endless debate]].

# Accountability
[[Democratic centralism establishes two-way accountability]]. In this way, it has an advantage over horizontalism, since [[Horizontalism lacks accountability]].
