# Globalization üåê

# Introduction
Globalization is one of the economic processes that happens under capitalism. As technology decreases the cost of transporting raw materials and [[commodities]] around the world, the markets of the world unify into one global market. However, while this lays the technological basis for globalization, the driving force is found in the class struggle. The real process behind globalization is [[imperialism]]. 

# Metrics
We can measure the integration of national markets by measuring the worth of goods and services that are internationally traded per year. In 2021, this equals 42 trillion USD.
