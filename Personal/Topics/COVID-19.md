# COVID-19 ðŸ¦

# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic was a global event that began in December 2019. The disease was first detected in Wuhan, [[China]], although there is debate as to where the virus actually originated, and when. 

As of August 12 2021, more than 204 million have been infected and 4.32 million deaths have been confirmed. 

# The Chinese response
In [[China]], the [[CPC]] clamped down relatively hard, if a little bit late, on the spread of the virus. 

# The American response
In the [[USA]], the response was much more limited and uneven than in China. By April 2022, the CDC reported that more than 60% of the US population had been infected at least once.
