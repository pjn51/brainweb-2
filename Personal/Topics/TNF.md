# Introduction
TNF is a cytokine, a small protein used by the immune system for cell signaling. When macrophages (a kind of white blood cell) detect infection, they release TNF to alert other immune cells as part of the inflammation response. 

There are two kinds of TNF signaling. TNFR1 tends to be pro-inflammatory, and is often targeted during the treatment of autoimmune diseases like [[Crohn's disease]]. TNFR2 signaling promotes wound healing.
