# Dictatorship of the proletariat
---
The dictatorship of the proletariat is a proposed organization of society during the transition from [[capitalism]] to [[communism]].   The state is composed of the armed working class, which suppresses their class enemies. However, this suppression is easier than the task of the bourgeois under capitalism, thus [[The workers' state is a semi-state]] that begins to wither away. 

[[Workers' states are contradictory]] in that they defend [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] law while also defending the interests of the [[proletariat]]. 

[[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]] because [[The state cannot be done away with overnight]]. 

The [[Russia|USSR]] represented such a [[state]] for a time, but [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] somewhere in the 20s or 30s.
