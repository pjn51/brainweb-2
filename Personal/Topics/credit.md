# Credit
---
The amount of credit that the economy is running with is truly getting insane. From a [[liberalism|liberal]] perspective, there is no problem with this under the normal conditions of [[capitalism]]. However, under crisis, if any significant country goes bankrupt or demands to cash in on its debt, the whole system will implode. Basically, [[Credit destabilizes the global economy]].

If [[Italy]] went bankrupt, and demanded the [[EU]] help it out, the EU doesn't have any [[currency|money]] either, and would try and cash in its debt owed from other countries, causing a spreading wildfire of debt pulls. 

The other issue with debt is that [[state]] pushes out the private sector and crowds the private market, causing a further slowdown of the economy. This happens when the state injects investment into the economy.
