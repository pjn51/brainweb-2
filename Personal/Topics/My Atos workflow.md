# My Atos Workflow


---
# Introduction
I want to have a place to think about the methods which I'm using to approach my [[Atos]] work, specifically to keep track of various reminders. 

# Exceptional domains
There are a few domains that we should always grade one way or another. 

```
Contoso              unclear - comment test
DAV public school    unclear
Resaka               unclear
HAKASHI              unclear
```

# Guidelines
- [[Browser UAs are easier to spoof than native ones]]
- [[Hosted sessions tend to have worse IP stats]]
- [[Cloud MFAs are trustworthy]]
- [[Legacy authentication is often compromise]]
