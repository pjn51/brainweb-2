# Introduction
Religions are the belief systems that frame the worldview, [[ethics]], and spirituality for a large segment of humanity. 

The most popular world religions include [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. 77% of the global population adheres to one of these three religions. 

# A Marxist perspective
According to [[Marxism|Marxists]], religion arises out of specific class relations and represents the perspectives of specific classes within society. For example, in mideval Europe, Protestantism represented the perspective of the nascent [[bourgeoisie]], while Catholicism represented the waning aristocracy. 

It also finds room to grow due to the pain caused by [[alienation]]. In the system of [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]], religion is a large factor in the superstructure of society, which defends, supports, and reproduces the economic relations of society. 

The Marxist perspective on religion is widely misinterpreted to say that Marxists are anti-religion. Instead, the Marxist position is that religion is made necessary by the suffering of humanity under [[capitalism]], and that in a classless society, organized religion would largely be obsolete. This does *not* say that it is the duty of Marxists to destroy religion. In fact, some revolutionary movements have relied on the religious feelings of the masses.
