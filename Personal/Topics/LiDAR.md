LiDAR is a  technique that uses active sensing to detect three-dimensional topography, even through dense foliage. 

The way that it works is that an airplane or other sensing platform will have an array of lasers mounted on the bottom that will repeatedly pulse as the aircraft moves over the target area. The array captures the amount of time that it takes for the lasers to return after the pulse.

Since lasers of multiple stengths are sent out, we can get a good idea of the foliage, as well as the ground, and even the density of the ground itself. If we want to see the canopy height, we look at the **first return**, meaning the travel time of the lasers which bounced off the leaves in the canopy, as many do. If we want to see the ground, we can look at the **last return**, meaning the travel time of the lasers which passed through the canopy and bounced off the earth. I'm not sure how geologic stuff is measured, but I know geologists like to use LiDAR too.
