This is a more condensed version of my [[flare log]]. 

# April 2020
On 4-8-20, I had vomited five times in the course of two days, and I had been prescribed [[entocort]] to manage the inflammation. I headed to the ER due to dehydration. 

At the ER, I underwent a CT scan that showed no signs of a blockage. I was prescribed [[vicodin]] and [[ondansetron]] for nausea. I was prescribed [[prednisone]] for my inflammation. 

# December 2020 - January 2021
Starting the day after Christmas, my abdominal pain intensified rapidly. I began vomiting and switched to an all-liquid diet that did contain dairy. This seemed to keep me stable enough through January, and I was able to slowly ease back into pureed chicken soup and things similar to that. My weight was rapidly decreasing during this time period.

I was prescribed [[entocort]] and began taking 9mg daily on 1-7-21. 

# February 2021
I tapered to 6mg entocort on 2-4-21, and experienced renewed abdominal pain and nausea. I went to the ER on 2-8-21, where I was given [[prednisone]] and [[oxycodone]].  At this point, I stopped taking entocort. After being discharged, I also took some [[vicodin]] that was leftover from a previous ER trip.

On 2-11-21, I ate a peanut butter smoothie with dairy, and vomited. I returned to the ER for re-hydration. I had a CT scan in the ER this time, but there were no indications of a blockage.

On 2-12-21, I returned to the ER after vomiting persisted. The doctors in the ER made the decision to admit me to the hospital. I was switched to IV prednisone during my hospital stay. 

I was hospitalized from the evening of 2-12-21 until the evening of 2-17-21. While hospitalized, I underwent a colonoscopy that found ulceration in my small intestine. I was prescribed [[remicade]] infusions, the first of which I recieved on the 2-17-21. I was also prescribed [[azathioprine]] to complement the remicade.

After my hospitalization, I made the decision to totally remove gluten and dairy from my diet.
