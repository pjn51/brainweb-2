The title is the offical documentation of [[real estate]] ownership. It's important to examine the title before closing, because [[Liens transfer with the property title]]. Right at the start of [[escrow]], the buyer will recieve a *preliminary title report* that details these sorts of things. 

[[There are multiple ways to share a property title]] when you have multiple co-owners.
