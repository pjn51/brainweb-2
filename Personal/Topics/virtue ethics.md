Virtue ethics is an approach towards [[ethics]] in philosophy. 

Virtue ethics tends to highlight the role of the moral character of the individual as the benchmark for morality, as opposed to a set body of rules or the consequences of one's actions.

# Fundamental Ideas
Virtue ethics were first formalized by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] in the West, and Mencius and Confucius in the East. It was the dominant approach to ethics up until the Enlightenment, and then again after the 50s or so. 

The re-emergence of virtue ethics caused an invigoration in the other two approaches, as theorists sought to answer the new questions that virtue ethic raised. Those answers are part of each approach's *virtue theory.* 

## Virtue
A virtue is a positive character trait. For something to be a virtue, as opposed to a hobby or policy, it has to be very fundamental to a person's behavior, and it has to be something that is held by the person as something more than a best policy, or a strategy for getting something.

For example, for someone to be an honest person, the person has to be honest a lot of the time, not just sometimes, and the person can't simply be being honest as a strategy to get people to like them. 

An honest person would think that being dishonest is genuinely bad, not just prone to causing bad things to happen. 

Of course, virtue is a matter of degrees. Nobody is perfectly virtuous. Virtue does not have to determine one's emotions towards a decision. An honest person might still be upset that they have to tell the truth, and might not *want* to do so, even if their honesty compels them to. 

## Wisdom
Virtue isn't one sided. Someone may posess a virtue "to a fault." For example, for someone to be so compassionate that they protect a criminal would be being compassionate to a fault. For someone to tell a murderer where their victim is hiding would be to be honest to a fault. 

So how can we define virtue as a purely positive characteristic? Aristotle calls this conception of virtue 'natural virtue,' and says that we need to incorporate *practical wisdom* to perfect this virtue. 

For someone to have wisdom means that they understand how to do the right thing in a given situation. This means tempering virtue with common sense, and combining various virtues that are relevant to the situation.

For example, a wise and virtuous person, when confronted with a murderer seeking a hiding victim, would feel that honesty is not the only virtue at play here. They would prioritize compassion for the victim over honesty towards the murderer. This is because they understand the consequences for honesty. 

# Forms of Virtue Ethics
The various forms of virtue ethics all agree that virtue is the central consideration, along with wisdom. However, they differ in how they think these ideas should be combined and how we should live our lives in general. 

## Eudaimonist Virtue Ethics
This school defines virtues in terms of their relationship with *eudaimonia.* The concept of eudaimonia is translated from greek to mean 'happiness' or 'flourishing.' 

However, these translations are not totally correct. Unlike 'flourishing,' rational beings can experience eudaimonia, and it is an objective condition, not a subjective experience like happiness. 

These ethicists insist that life should be spent in the pursuit of this eudaimonia, and that a virtuous and wise life is the only path to success. 

## Agent-Based and Exemplarist Virtue Ethics
These ethicists say that we can trace back eudaimonia and other sources of virtue back to the motivations and attitudes of agents.

The goodness of action A is determined by the agent's motives when he or she performs action A. 

Alternatively, some theorists of this school say that action A is good if it is the kind of action that a virtuous actor would perform.

## Target-Centered Virtue Ethics
The touchstone for these folks begins with our existing conceptions of the virtues. The target-centered approach begins with the idea that the various virtues have "a tick of approval" in our minds.

*Note: This approach is confusing, and I don't understand it.*

## Platonistic Virtue Ethics
It's debatable if Plato was a virtue ethicist, but he certainly contributed to the field a lot. 

# Objections to Virtue Ethics
A number of objections to this ethical approach have been raised. In this section, we will consider some of the most popular.

## The Problem of Application
In the early days of the revival of virtue ethics, the approach was associated with an attempt to step away from the universal sets of rules that were put forward by other ethical methods. Virtue ethicists said that there was no way to create a universally-applicable rulebook that could determine the right thing to do in all situations. 

This is a major complaint about virtue ethics from other ethical schools. However, the other schools have had issues creating these universal rules as well, showing that virtue ethics may be on to something here.
