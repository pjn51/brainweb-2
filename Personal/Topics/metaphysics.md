# Introduction
Metaphysics is the [[philosophy]] that stands in opposition to [[dialectics]]. It tends to view things in isolation from other things, and as finished products, stationary in their characteristics. 

# Ascent of metaphysics
Metaphysics arose out of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] democratic movements that swept Europe in the 17th and 18th century. In its ascendant phase, it was a progressive philosophy, cutting away the mysticism that was the philosophical output of [[feudalism]]. In that way, it was a progressive development. It allowed for the development of the scientific method and the categoriziation of all sorts of things. 

# Descent of metaphysics 
As [[capitalism]] lost its progressive character, so did metaphysics. The categorization of species, materials, and other things was useful to some extent, but it lost the perspective of the whole of an object's existance. The theories of [[evolution]] and all other scientific theories eventually began to be held back by the characterization of objects as unchanging, pre-defined categories of being.
