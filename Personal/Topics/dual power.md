# Dual Power


---
# Introduction
In [[Marxism]], the concept of dual power describes the revolutionary stage at which the [[proletariat]] has begun to pose the question of which class should control society. In [[Russia]], this stage saw the development of soviets, or workers' councils, that existed alongside the Provisional Government for some time. 

When a situation of dual power develops, there are only two possible outcomes - either the workers will complete their march to victory and overthrow [[state]] and the [[bourgeoisie]], or else the forces of counter-revolution will succeed in crushing the [[mass organizations]] of the working class. 

Among base builders (see [[mutual aid]]), there is a misconception of what dual power means. They think that mutual aid groups are an example of dual power, since they supposedly represent structures of power that exist outside of [[capitalism]]. However, this is a totally [[metaphysics|empiricist]] framing of things. As I discussed, the concept of dual power is best concieved of in a specific historical context, as as stage in the workers' movement.
