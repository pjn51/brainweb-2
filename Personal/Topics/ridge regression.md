# Ridge Regression
---
Ridge regression is a form of [[regression]] [[modeling|model]] that incorporates [[regularization]] automatically. It does this by using a [[loss function]]
$$
C = \text{error metric} + \lambda\sum\beta^2
$$
where $\beta$ represents the size of each coefficient, $\lambda$ is the regularization strength from zero to one, and $C$ is the total loss. 

[[Ridge regression retains weak predictors]].
