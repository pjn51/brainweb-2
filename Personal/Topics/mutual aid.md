# Mutual Aid (aka Base-Building)
#tactic 

---
Mutual aid is a tactic often used by [[Anarchism|anarchists]] and [[Maoism|maoists]], as well as an increasing number of [[DSA]] activists. 

## Argument for mutual aid
Proponents of mutual aid as a tactic say that this is closely related to the tactic of 'base building.' The idea is that the vanguard party needs to build support among the oppressed by helping to provide for their needs, and show them that there are ways of doing so that are counter to the structure of capitalism.

From an anarchist perspective, the idea is to just create networks to support each other, and ignore the state and capitalism altogether. In this way, anarchists seek to build the new world before the death of the old. 

## Argument against mutual aid
While mutual aid is the result of a noble impulse, using it as a tactic betrays a misunderstanding of the way that the revolutionary party gains support. The masses don't come to revolutionary conclusions because revolutionaries meet the needs of the oppressed, they come to these conclusions based on a hatred caused by [[capitalism]] itself, and a recognition that our ideas represent a path towards liberation.

Additionally, engaging in mutual aid is a giant project. Because of the nature of capitalism, and the class position of the [[vanguard]] of the [[proletariat]], organizations of the working class will never be able to satisfy the unfilled needs of the masses. This is a recipe for burning comrades out, and draining the resources of the organization. 

Therefore, revolutionary organizations ought to focus on developing politically and structurally, and preparing for revolutionary conditions. They should seek to make connections with the masses not on the basis of aid, but on the basis of our ideas, like [[Bolsheviks]] did with the Russian working class.
