# Wages ðŸ’µ

## Introduction
In [[Marxism|Marxist]] economics, wages are the amount paid to a worker for a set amount of [[labor]]. This can be priced through time spent working, or by commodity created. 

## Relative wage
The % of the [[surplus value]] going towards your wage.

## Real wage
The amount of [[commodities]] that the wage can purchase for the worker.

## The source of wages
The average wage can rise or fall depending on working class unity, as well as the supply and demand of labor in that given industry. The minimum wage is set by the price of reproduction of the laborer, while the wage will never exceed 100% of the value created by the labor (the [[surplus value]]).
