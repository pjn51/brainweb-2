# Introduction
I need to carefully figure out which [[health]] plans are best for me at [[Atos]]. There are four health plans available. 

# PPO Gold
This plan has a bonkers premium but everything else is great. I am NOT eligible for a HSA with this plan.

- Premium: $169.89 bi-weekly
- In network deductible: $400
- OOP maximum: $2,750
- Coinsurance: 15%
- PCP visit: $25 copay
- Specialist: $45 copay
- Urgent care: $55 copay
- Behavioral: $15 copay
- ER: $350 copay, waived if admitted
- Retail RX: 15%, max $150

If I had this plan... (assuming nothing goes wrong)
```
$45			specialist visit
$75			remicade (every other month)
$14			azathioprine

---
$134		monthly costs

---
$1608 		annual medical cost
$4417.14	annual premiums

$6025.14	annual total cost
```

# Conclusion
It seems like the PPO silver plan is best for me. The premium is rather high, but my main cost is rx and that's capped at $300 per month MAX for my two medications. It seems like I should expect around $250 or $300 per month on healthcare costs ðŸ˜¢ and that's just health, we haven't discussed vision or dental!!!
