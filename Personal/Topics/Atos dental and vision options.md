# Atos dental and vision options

# Dental
This is where I'll take notes on the dental plan options for [[Atos]]. 

## PPO Gold
Premium = $12.75 bi-weekly --> $331.5 annual
Calendar year plan maximum = $1,500
Basic services = 0%
Major procedures = 40% after deductible

## PPO Silver
Premium = $5.78 bi-weekly --> $150.28 annually
Calendar year plan maximum = $1,000
Basic services = 20% after deductible
Major procedures = 50% after deductible

## Conclusion
It seems like I should go with silver here. Hard to predict how frequently I'll need dental work.

# Vision
Note that only *differences* between plans are recorded. 

## Gold
Premium = $4.15 bi-weekly --> $107.90 anually
Exam = $15
Frames = $160 to $180 allowance
Contacts = $150 allowance in lieu of frames

## Silver
Premium = $2.60 bi-weekly --> $67.6 annually
Exam = $20
Frames = $140 to $160 allowance
Contacts = $130 allowance in lieu of frames

## Conclusion
Let's go with silver here as well. That's a big annual difference for a little cheaper frames. I don't expect to have any serious vision work done. 

# Overall conclusion
```
$150.28		annual dental premium // silver plan
