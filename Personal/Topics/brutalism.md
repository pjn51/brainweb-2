Brutalism is a style of [[architecture]] that emerged in the 1950s in the [[UK]]. Brutalist structures are characterized by minimalism, exposed concrete, and geometric shapes. 

This style was featured in many [[consequentialism|utilitarian]], low cost social housing initiatives in the [[UK]], and soon became associated with [[socialism]].  

By the 1980s, the trend was basically over, and had given way to [[structural expressionism]] and [[deconstructivism]].
