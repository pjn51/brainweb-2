# Boredom


---
## Introduction
Boredom is an [[emotion]] that I've been thinking a lot about recently. There are certainly some advantages to boredom that I want to get into.

## Unique characteristics of boredom
Unlike other emotions, boredom is actually the lack of stimulus, not a stimulus of its own. 

## The purpose of boredom
I would suspect that we get bored in order to encourage ourselves to go out and experience more things in life, and to prevent ourselves from becoming too complacent. It's a way of indicating that our level of stimulation is too low. 

## Boredom and burnout
I think that boredom may be the cure for [[burnout]]. By being bored, our bodies are telling us that we're at a place of very low stimulation, which is the opposite of feeling burnt out.
