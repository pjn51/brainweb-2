# Dot Method

# Introduction
The dot method is a [[PKM]] technique of my own creation for taking notes from physical books that I've been playing around with. The technique has three stages: intake, processing, and ideation. 

# Intake
Information intake is the first stage of the cycle. I read a book while using an index card as a bookmark. When I get to a passage that demands a note, I make a dot in the margin and write the page number of this dot on my index card, along with a short description to remind me why I marked it. 

After accumulating a decent number of dots, I move on to stage two: processing.

# Processing
After I have sufficient material from the intake stage, I can thumb through to all the dots that have not yet been processed. I can create notes from whatever content I thought was interesting, and then I mark the dot completed on the index card. 

I can create either free-floating idea notes, or write the idea down on the literature note, whatever seems right. The idea with this stage is to just keep track of the raw material that ideas spring from. 

# Ideation
When I find compelling ideas in these themes and topics that I wish to elaborate on further, I can create atomic idea notes from them, linked to the topics they're related to on the literature note. This is the final stage of the workflow, when I assimilate whatever is useful from the author's ideas into my own body of knowledge. 

# Advantages of this system
This system has a few advantages. It lets me get in the flow, it allows for me to come back to ideas after contemplating them, it honors learning as a dynamic process rather than a fixed outcome, and it forces me to return to source material. 

First of all, it allows me to enjoy reading more and get in a flow of taking in new information. I merely leave a dot and move on, knowing that the idea which was sparked will be safely recorded later. 

This method also allows me to put some space between the spark and the elaboration of an idea. Sometimes, I make a dot, and then coming back to it, I have a more complete idea of why that dot was put there, whereas I sometimes have only a vague notion of why a paragraph is interesting in the moment. 

One unique perk of this method is that it accepts that learning is a dynamic process rather than a finite task. Reading a book once is not enough to grasp all the interesting ideas, and this method reminds me that I can easily go through and add more little dots as I understand the material more deeply. The fact that I don't have comprehensive notes forces me to return to the source material where I could actually deepen my understanding further than a re-read of my notes would allow.
