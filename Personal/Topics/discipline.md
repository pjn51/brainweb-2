# Discipline ðŸ’ª

# Introduction
I feel like discipline is an essential pillar in living a good life and maintaining [[productivity]]. Discipline, and willpower, are the dominance of long-term goals over short-term ones. Without this, it isn't really possible to improve my life by doing things that are less pleasurable in the moment, but will lead to a large payoff eventually.

# Discipline vs Motivation
I would say that discipline is preferable to motivation, because motivation is very dynamic. It comes and goes, and when you're in a slump (precisely the time where doing productive habits is most important) your motivation disappears. However, with discipline, the slump is managed and can be recovered from. 

# Discipline is Not a Muscle
Discipline doesn't need to recharge. 'Taking a break' will only lead to another and another. The best way to maintain discipline is to be consistent about it, and start with a good habit right in the morning. 

# Methods
One method is to focus on a small [[habit]]. I currently have a list that I work towards. 

# Stoicism and discipline
I think that [[Stoicism]] might have a lot of things to say about staying disciplined.

# Discipline and [[How can we model personality?]]
