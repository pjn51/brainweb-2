# Introduction
After [[modeling]], we need to be able to grade our model performance. We do so using some sort of metric. We can then maximize or minimize this metric within a [[loss function]]. 

# Choosing a metric
When choosing a metric, we have to know what kind of modeling task we're dealing with. [[Choose metrics carefully]]. 

## Metrics for regression
The [[coefficient of determination]] is a very basic metric that reveals the proportion of variance in the target feature that is explained by the other features. 

## Metrics for classification
There are various [[classification metrics]] out there.
