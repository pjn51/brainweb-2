# Value
---
Value is a tricky thing to describe outright. 

According to the economic theories of [[Marxism]], there are different kinds of value when it comes to [[commodities]]. We can differentiate between [[use value]], the quality of being useful or providing some value to the user of the item, and [[exchange value]], having the quality of being valuable in terms of exchange with other commodities. For example, food has a much higher use value than exchange value, while gold is the inverse. 

[[All capitalist labor is exploitative]] because it generates [[surplus value]] that's appropriated by the [[bourgeoisie|capitalist]]. 

Another important concept here is [[surplus value]], and the broader concept of the [[labor theory of value]].
