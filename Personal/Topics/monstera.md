Monstera is one of the most valuable [[plants]] in our house. It is an evergreen tropical vine / shrub that grows in Central America. 

There are two popular domestic sub-species, *Monstera deliciosa* and *Monstera adansonii*. The latter is unique in that it has long, tapering leaves and enclosed leaf holes, as opposed to that of *M. deliciosa.* 

When outdoors, they flower and produce edible fruit, particularly *M. deliciosa,* however this rarely happens indoors. 

# Soil Preference

# Light Preference
Monstera thrives in **bright to medium indirect light**. It isn't sutited for direct sunlight, but can be accimated to withstand it. 

# Water Preference
**Water every 1-2 weeks**, allowing soil to dry out in between waterings. Water more when in bright light, and less when in lower light. 

# Common Issues
Symptom | Cause
---|---
Leaves turning brown and crispy | Underwatered or high salt build-up
Wilting plant, dry soil | Underwatered or pot-bound
Yellowing leaves, black stems, wet soil | Overwatered
