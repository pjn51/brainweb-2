Most regression models assume that the dependent variable, denoted by $Y_i$, is a [[function]] of 

## Variants
The classic variant is the[[linear regression]] model. 

Ridge and LASSO are kinds of linear regression models that incorporate [[regularization]]. 

[[CART models]] can also be used to solve regression problems.
