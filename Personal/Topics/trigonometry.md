Trigonometry is the mathematical study of triangles. 

## Trig functions
These are the primary functions used in trigonometry.

For these equations, we use a triangle in this form:

## Sine
$$
sin\theta = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}
$$
Sine is maximized at $\theta = 90^o$ and minimized at $\theta = 270^o$
## Cosine
$$
cos\theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$
Cosine  is maximized at $\theta = 360^o$ and minimized at $\theta = 180^o$
## Tangent
$$
tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$
Tangent is weird, because it has holes in its domain. 

## Cosecant
$$
csc(\theta)=\frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}}
$$
## Secant
$$
sec(\theta)=\frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$
## Cotangent
$$
cot(\theta)=\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}
$$

# Trigonometric identities
We can convert between these functions. For instance, we can go from sine and cosine to tangent in the following way.

$$
\frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}=\frac{opp/hyp}{adj/hyp}=\frac{opp}{adj}=tan(\theta)
$$

$\frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}=tan(\theta)$ is our first identity. 

Starting function | conversion
---|---
$sin(\theta)$ | $1/csc(\theta)$
$cos(\theta)$ | $1/sec(\theta)$
$tan(\theta)$|$1/cot(\theta)$
