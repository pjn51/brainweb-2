The study of commodities is a central topic of [[Marxism|Marxist]] economics. 

A commodity is something that is bought and intended to be sold on the market. For example, if I buy a pair of socks, it is no longer a commodity. If I buy 1,000 pairs of socks in order to resell them, those socks are commodities. 

[[capitalism]] entails commodity production. We should be able to judge the development of [[socialism]] by a movement towards the abscence of commodities, as resources would be allocated based on *need* rather than profit gained through sale of goods.
