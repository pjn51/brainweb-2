# The June 2020 Uprising âœŠ


---
# Introduction
So far, I haven't really written about contemporary history, but I see no reason that I shouldn't. 

This is a huge topic so this is def a work in progress note. 

# The Molecular Process of Revolution
On a steep slope, with lots of snow, we don't see anything noteworthy at first. But with a gust of wind or a few new snowflakes, an avalanche might start. In this same way, the forces that were at play in the months and years before George Floyd was murdered were working to set up an avalanche fueled not only by police brutality, but all the anger and rage that are caused by [[capitalism]]. 

# George Floyd as the Spark
When Floyd was murdered on May 25th, that really lit the fuse on the whole situation. The video was just too graphic, and represented the real situation for Black Americans too literally to stand. 

Thousands took to the streets of Minneapolis, confronting the police. The police used tear gas the very next day, the 26th, in an attempt to disperse protestors. A few days later, on the 29th, a police precinct in Minneapolis was burned to the ground. Polling later found that 54% of Americans thought this was a justified response to police brutality. 

# The Whip of Repression
Across the country, protests seemed to follow a similar pattern. In each city, protests in solidarity with Minneapolis, and against local martyrs who had been killed by the police would begin, and they would face overreactions and severe repression by the police. 

This repression would invigorate the protest, adding more and more fuel to the fire as people saw the repressive apparatus of the state used against peaceful demostrators right before their eyes. 

As Marxists, we know that the [[class consciousness]] of the masses changes based on events. This situation was no exception. As they saw these atrocities, the mood of the people involved in these protests became more and more steeled. This is what caused the protests in each major city to really take on a life of their own once they began. 

Slogans began to emerge. "Defund the police" was the unifying message across the country. This platform of negative demands carried the movement forward, as it was more difficult to co-opt than previous messages of increased police accountability. However, there were less unifying messages when it came to positive demands of what to replace the police with. 

This was a symptom of the general lack of leadership and direction of the movement, and as we know from our study of [[dialectics]], there is no light without dark, no up without down, and there *certainly* was no BLM without the police presence at these protests that kept passions burning.

# What Now? The Police Withdraw
An existence in opposition to the state and the police only works as long as the police provide a framework to base protests around. I'll now turn to the situation in [[Seattle]] specifically to highlight the issues with a movement that exists only in opposition.

The East Precinct in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of [[Seattle]] was the focal point for the BLM protests in the city. There are countless videos of the thousands of protestors beseiging the precinct. 

On June 9th, Seattle police abandoned the precinct to the protestors. There has been a lot of speculation as to why they made this decision. But it really doesn't matter. Whether it was a deliberate attempt to take the wind out of the sails of the movement, or a decision made out of fear, the effect was the same in the long run. 

The protestors seized the moment to attempt to secure their gains. They blocaded streets and began to set up aid stations and food distribution within what was being called the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ. 

Now the only question was what to do with this new area of control. 

# Cracks in the State Apparatus
If we look closely, we can see that the ruling class was unprepared for such an uprising. The over-reaction of the police led to more and more escalation of the protest, and the most likely reason for this is that the police were terrified to see such anger directed at them. 

# Leadership and Direction
There were two divergent groups that vied for leadership in the movement. There was a liberal tendency, which we see at every protest. However, this group was weakened by the intense police violence that had radicalized the masses to some extent. 

The ones who stood to benefit from this radicalization was the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] tendency. Many in this tendency may not have described themselves as anarchists, but we can see in their ideas and tactics that this is the school that they most naturally belong to. 

While rhetorically there was no formal leader of CHAZ, the lack of a formal structure for governance of the area betrayed a misunderstanding of how leaders actually emerge from organic movements. The participants of CHAZ may have wanted to prevent a clique from taking control, but their lack of a formal process for leadership actually guaranteed this to happen. 

Leaders emerge from the masses on the basis of their charisma, their ideas, and most importantly, their willingness to put in the work required. In this way, the emergence of a leadership is inevitable in any movement. The only effect that having no leadership positions has is to remove all responsibility from these leaders, and make holding anyone accountable impossible. Not to mention the inability for the group to act as one when it comes to critical decision points. 

This is exactly what happened in CHAZ. Armed groups became self-appointed security for the zone, with no consent from the movement as a whole, and little accountability as to who these people really were. This led directly to the killing of two Black teenagers who were mistaken for right wing provocateurs. Of course, those responsible vanished into thin air, and still haven't been found. 

It was events like this that sucked the public support away from CHAZ, which at some point was renamed to the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, in an [[idealism|idealistic]] attempt to change the direction of a movement whose participants could feel stagnating. 

# The Future of the Movement
Unfortunately, the leadership of the movement lacked a basis in [[dialectical materialism]]. They didn't understand how change happened in the world, and were therefore unprepared for the changes that came to their movement. They were unprepared for victory, in the case of the police withdrawl, and allowed CHAZ/CHOP to become an apolitical liberal playground by day and a dangerous area by night, and they were unprepared for defeat. When the mainly liberal masses retreated from the movement, the hardened activist core should have consolidated their gains, and made a tactical retreat. Instead, they attempted to moralize the masses back into the streets, and when that failed, they turned their attention to protecting the homeless who had taken the opportunity to move into the area. 

In this way, their resources got sucked into the black hole of [[mutual aid]]. This isn't an indictment of them from moral grounds - their actions, especially as popular support was receding, were heroic. And the plight of the homeless is a moral travesty, especially in a place like Seattle. 

However, Marxists don't do what we do out of a sense of morality alone. We organize the [[proletariat]], and not the [[lumpenproletariat]], because the working class is the revolutionary force that can break capitalism apart and create a world where there will be no homelessness, and no police violence for that matter. 

If we want such a world, we have to turn a critical eye to the failures of past movements, and learn from them. The June uprising in Seattle and elsewhere is no exception.
