# Introduction
The [[philosophy]] of dialectical materialism (DiaMat) combines the [[dialectics]] of [[Hegel]] with a view of the universe based in [[materialism]]. It provides the foundational worldview and theory of change in [[Marxism]], underpinning the economic and historical analyses of that school of thought. 

For a more in-depth look on both of these topics, see [[Socialism - Utopian and Scientific (1880)]].

## Materialism
Materialism is simply the principle that a real material reality exists, and it is this material reality that causes things in the word to change. Materialism stands in opposition to [[idealism]], the principle stating that it is ideas which are more 'real' than material things, and it is ideas which change the world. 

This seems commonsense, because it is the philosophy of materialism that allows our modern world to run. The real issue is that this materialism is artificially walled off from the social sciences in any real way. For example, if you told a chemist that reactions were inherently unique each time, and were too hard to predict because there were lots of variables, the chemist would laugh. But these are basically the 'scientific' conclusions of bourgeois political theorists.

If a bourgeois theorist was studying the reaction of water and heat, at first they would write an op-ed claiming that water is liquid and is certainly not a gas. Anyone who would suppose otherwise is insane. Then, as the bubbles began to form, they would say that water itself is losing its meaning, perhaps due to the changing values of the water. Then as the water began to boil, the theorist would claim that water was a gas all along!

# Political implications
Dialectical materialism helps us escape from reacting to our impressions of reality, which often reflect the trajectory of the previous time period. For example, to relate this to the revolutionary events in [[Germany]] in the 1910s and 20s, we can see that lacking a DiaMat analysis, the [[KPD]], at the peak of the fury believed that the anger would continue. When it began to disspate, they were isolated from the mass movement, and many activists were killed or arrested without the protection of the masses. Then they would re-orient to the conditions of a contraction in the movement, and fail to take advantage of the coming upsurge. 

In comparison, a DiaMat perspective instructs us that we have to look at the forces that are acting on the masses' political perspective and willingness to fight. If we can see which forces are increasing in strength and which are decreasing, we can predict the movement of the masses.
