## Fives According to the Enneagram Institute

I am an [[What is the Enneagram?]] type five. This type is called ==The Investigator==. It is an intense, cerebral type that can be perceptive, innovative, secretive, and isolated. 

==Basic [[fear]]==: being useless, helpless, or incapable.
==Basic Desire==: to be capable and competent. 

==Key Motivations==: To possess knowledge, to understand the world in order to defend the self from threats. 

==Famous fives==: [[Buddha]], Einstein, [[Nietzsche]], [[Sartre]], David Lynch. 

More than any other type, [[Enneagram Fives seek expertise]]. Behind this drive is a deep insecurity. Fives feel that they just aren't able to do things as well as others. In response to this, fives tend to withdraw into their minds where they feel more capable. 

### Levels of Development
1. Become visionaries, broadly comprehending and penetrating the world. Open minded, taking things in their whole context. Make pioneering discoveries and change the way things are thought about and done.
2. Observe everything with perceptiveness and insight. Mentally alert and curious.

9. Seeking oblivion, they may become suicidal or have a psychotic break. Generally corresponds with the schizoid avoidant and schizotypal personality disorders.

### Personal Growth Recommendations
Fives need to keep their mental space in balance with the other aspects of their lives. Take a step back and learn to notice when your trains of thought or speculation are dragging other aspects of your life down, and learn to moderate them.

Notice when a project or research interest is no longer fufilling the needs of your life more generally and try and redirect your attention towards something more useful, while also stimulating you intellectually. 

Fives need to push themselves to open up to those around them, fighting against their instinct to avoid pain and conflict by turning inward. Remember that conflict is a natural part of all relationships that ought to be worked through.
