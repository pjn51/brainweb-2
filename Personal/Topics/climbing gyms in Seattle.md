# Climbing Gyms in Seattle


---
# Introduction
I want to find a [[climbing]] gym to go to in [[Seattle]] once I get a job.

# Seattle Bouldering Project 
Here's their [website](https://seattleboulderingproject.com/).
They have locations in south Central District and in Fremont. Membership costs $75 per month with a $40 start-up fee, or you can pay $780 per year, which amounts to $65 per month. They could do a single month for $95. 

- Pros
	- I think Maddy and Marina go here to work out.
- Cons
	- Central District / Fremont location.
	- Cost is at least $65 monthly, and it costs $40 to start an account.
	- No ropes.

# Stone Gardens Seattle
Here's the [website](https://stonegardens.com/). 
A monthly membership costs $74, with a $50 start-up fee. It comes with one free guest pass per month, and two free "first time" guest passes per visit. 

I could also do a 10 punch pass for $180, which amounts to $18 per session. If I climb more than once a week, it's better to get the monthly membership. They offer a 30-day intro pass for $102, which just seems way worse than getting a monthly membership and then canceling it. 

We could do a family membership for $128 per month, meaning $64 monthly. 

- Pros
	- They have ropes
	- Slightly cheaper than SBP
- Cons
	- Ballard location

# Momentum Indoor Climbing Seattle
Here's the [website](https://www.momentumclimbing.com/sodo/).
Monthly membership: $68 + $59 enrollment fee.
Couple membership: $108 + $59 enrollment fee ($54 per person monthly).

- Pros
- Cons
	- SODO location
	- No ropes

# Edgeworks
Monthly membership: $74 + $50 enrollment fee.
Couple membership: $136 + $40 enrollment fee ($68 per person monthly).

- Pros
	- Ropes!
	- 1 guest pass per month, 2 first-time passes per day
- Cons
	- Price, location (Bellevue - 22 min drive)

# Conclusion
The cheapest option is Momentum at $54 monthly with the couples' membership, but I *really* want to be able to climb ropes. That means my best option is Edgeworks at $74 monthly. I need to find somebody to climb with though, but I could take Eylen with me once a month using the free pass.
