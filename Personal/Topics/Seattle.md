# Seattle 
---
Seattle is a city in the [[USA]] where I live.

There are a lot of leftist groups in and around Seattle. There's [[DSA]], which is the largest by far. Then there's [[Socialist Alternative]], [[FSP]], [[PSL]], and of course the [[IMT]]. There are probably others that I haven't encountered. 

There are a few [[climbing gyms in Seattle]] that I want to check out.
