# Postmodernism
---
Postmodernism is a school of [[philosophy]] that stands opposed to [[modernism]], and thus to [[dialectical materialism]], as well as every other method of making sense of the world. It views all progress as totally subjective, and doesn't think that it's possible to analyze human development in a scientific way. Basically, [[Postmodernism questions all nariatives]]. 

Postmodernist thinkers are skeptical of any historical narriative, even though their skepticism does create its own historical narriative (one that makes no sense whatsoever). They view all the events of history as seperate affairs that are not constrained and pushed forward by common features or patterns of behavior, or outright abandon the concept of progress whatsoever.

[[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]]. And the fact that postmodernism is the defacto reigning ideology in [[academy|academia]] today signifies the fact that the [[bourgeoisie]] can no longer have any conception of forward progress for humanity. In an epoch where all they can do is attempt in vain to safeguard their wealth, it makes sense that there would be a prevailing attitude of helplessness and confusion when it comes to the direction of human development. This is why [[Postmodernism is a philosophy of despair]]. 

I also think that postmodernism is plain annoying, since [[Asking questions without proposing an answer is annoying]] and these thinkers tend to do that a lot.
