In [[art]], it's important to develop a style, and to find new ideas for art things.

## The Brief
Illustrators recieve briefs that tell them all the guidelines they have to follow for the illustration. When you have a brief, you already have a base to work on that you can brainstorm with. 

This can help cut through the initial step of deciding what to draw. 

### Know Your Niche
What is your specialty? Do you enjoy telling a story, displaying an emotion? Or maybe you like to create complex scenes. 

## Wordplay Ideation
There are two methods to this. The first is easy, while the second takes more preparation.

### Finding Wordplay
We can find some interesting imagery in literature, preferably by a good author! Certain phrases from books or poems can evoke images that we could try and bring to life. 

For example, a poem that says "I went into the citrus coffee cups of your hands" or "I went into the darkest corner of your hair" could evoke some interesting stuff. 

### Adjectives and Nouns
Collect a list of equal length for each of these categories. Take this collection and randomly assign one from each list to a pair. 

Now doodle an illustration for each pair, and then create a more finished piece from the set of doodles.
