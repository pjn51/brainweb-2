# Thought Cabinet Workflow

# Introduction
I am following a loose version of the workflow described in [[How To Take Smart Notes (2017)]]. This will not discuss how to create idea notes, only the workflow before and after their creation. There are two modes of knowledge work within this system: note creation and note upkeep. First, I will discuss note creation.

When it comes to taking notes from literature, I first create a note for the book, article, or whatever it is that I'm learning from. Then, I will jot down main ideas in a list. After finishing reading, or whenever I feel compelled to move to the next step, I will review these ideas, and see which ones are worthy of elaboration. I perform this elaboration by creating idea notes around these main ideas. Then I will move on to my general workflow.

The general workflow starts after the creation of an idea note. I will write the note, tag it with whatever topics it addresses, and then I will ensure that it's accounted for in my [[thought cabinet]]. As long as it is tagged with a pre-existing category, there's no additional work to be done here, but if it is tagged with a new category, I have to add that category to the cabinet. 

After it has been accounted for, I will scroll through the cabinet, and look for any ideas that seem to connect with the idea that I've just written. If I find one, I will link to it from the new note. By linking to it, I will establish a bi-directional connection, since all idea notes have a [[dataview]] query that allows me to see unlisted backlinks. 

Now we can move on to the second type of knowledge work within this system, note upkeep. Periodically, I will revisit idea notes, and I look to see if the idea is mentioned anywhere that hasn't explicitly been written about on this note. If so, I may choose to write a short blurb explaining why that connection exists.
