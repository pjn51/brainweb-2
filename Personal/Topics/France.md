## 1968
There were millions in the streets, and red flags flying over factories all throughout the major cities. Unfortunately, the French Communist Party talked the masses down, preferring to make a deal with the French [[state]] so that a new government would be created. 

This was a classic betrayal of the working class, and 1968 could have been the year that a socialist revolution hit France.

Notably, the [[PCF]] soon lost a lot of popular support and their electoral gains were erased within a few elections.
