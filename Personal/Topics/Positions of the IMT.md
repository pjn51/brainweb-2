# Positions of the IMT
---
# Ideas
[[The IMT considers itself a tendency rather than a party]]. 

# IMT's orientation towards the DSA
We are raising our ideas within [[DSA]], trying to encourage DSA to help create a working class party. 

We are not practicing [[entryism]] within the DSA. We aren't dissolving our organization, we aren't being secretive, we aren't trying to take over DSA. 

# IMT's orientation towards the [[Democratic Party]]
The IMT has a clear perspective of [[class independence]] and refuses to work within or support a capitalist party. 

The Democrats may seem to provide small reforms and aesthetic changes in comparison to the Republicans, but their inability to solve or even adress the real problems of [[capitalism]] will simply cause a swing back to the Republicans sooner or later. 

# The IMT on Sanders
We chose to neither endorse nor talk shit about Bernie. While we refuse to endorse a Democrat, we were still able to win over a lot of his supporters to revolutionary ideas, both before and after he caved to the pressure and endorsed [[Biden]].

Because we didn't endorse him, when he was revealed to be a dead-end in his potential, this further strengthed our position and sent many of his supporters our way, as events had validated our perspective. 

# The IMT on entryism
The IMT is not opposed in principle to the tactic of [[entryism]]. We value flexibility of tactics over dogmatic reliance on one tactic or another, or the principled refusal to use a certain tactic. With this in mind, we aren't doing entryism in any section.

We aren't carrying out a strategy of entrism in the [[DSA]]. The [[IMT]] is not formally dissolving ourselves into the DSA, nor are we attempting to take over their leadership. 

We aren't even following a tactic of entrism in the [[Labour Party (UK)]] with *Socialist Appeal*. They did consider doing this in support of Corbyn, considering attempting to seek election to LP positions. However, they determined that Corbyn wasn't aggressive enough to carry through a purge of the LP's rightwing elements. 

Entrism is not possible in the Democratic Party.

> Events, events, events, will shake the LP to its foundations. The LPs and TUs will become forums for revolutionary discussion. The stagnant atmosphere in the party and country will be transformed.
> \- Ted Grant, [[Problems of Entrism (1959)]]

It is precisely this aspect which is lacking in [[Democratic Party]]. The Democratic party lacks the internal structure to allow for *any* discussion to really take place, much less a revolutionary discussion.

# The IMT on gun control
As for every issue, we need a class approach and a class analysis. We want the working class to be able to defend themselves, but we recognize that our weapon isn't the gun, but the strike. Therefore, we don't view the ability of the working class to arm themselves as a primary consideration, although it is certainly a consideration.

> [!question]
> Is this because of the sheer size of the working class today compared to the struggles of the past? If not, what separates our situation from the ones in the past where armed uprising was an essential component for revolution? Or is this a political manuver, where we see that the need for armed detachments of the working class will present itself later but don't want to come out in support of that right now?

# The IMT on BLM and [[June 2020 uprising]]
We support the Black Lives Matter movement. In places where our org was large enough to put forward demands, we tried to promote an orientation towards the [[unions]], and called for the organization of neighborhood self-defense committees in major cities.
