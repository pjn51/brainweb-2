# Hobbies
---
I want to get more hobbies that keep me well rounded as a person. Ideally, I want hobbies that get me out of the house, introduce me to new people, and give me more self-confidence by allowing me to express skill.

**Pottery.** I took one random pottery class and it was really fun. I think I could get more into this, and it's a good way for me to get into an [[art]] activity though something that I enjoy. This one is a little expensive. 

**Climbing.** I used to do this so much, and this is a great [[exercise]] for my whole body. It also connects me with anothe community and gets me out of the house. The only downside is the cost. For some places I could go, see [[climbing gyms in Seattle]].
