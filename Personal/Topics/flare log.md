# Sudden flare December 2020
## Saturday,  Dec 26th  
I had a big dinner last night, prime rib with baked potato, asparagus, and a martini.i had meat and potatoes pie this morning for breakfast. A few hours later, stomach pain intensified and I ==vomited== (2:21 pm). I felt better after vomiting.  
  
5:45- woke from nap,felt better. Drank shake.

## Sunday,  Dec 27th  
Felt fine in AM, had greek yogurt. Went on walk for 30min, felt exhausted. Back and stomach pain, returned home. Medium ==stomach pain== around 4pm.  
  
Pain increased after 4, and subsided around 7.  

## Monday, Dec 28th
Felt fine in AM, had shake and some pieces of sushi throughout the morning. ==Stomach pain== began around 2:45 pm. Low energy. 

I talked to a nurse at my gastro office who recommended tylenol for the pain. Dr Zisman ordered blood and fecal tests, as well as an MRI which I am hesitant to go do since I don't feel THAT bad. But since I have really good insurance right now maybe I should just do it. 

I ate five pieces of sushi around mid-day. 

Stomach pain intensified throughout the afternoon. I ==vomited== at 3:15, and stomach pain intensified until 7. I was feeling very light headed and weak until I drank more beelers broth and an electrolyte drink. After about 30 min, I began to feel better, and my symptoms eventually subsided totally. 

## Tuesday, Dec 29th
Felt fine in AM as usual, commited to a liquid-only diet today. Had shake for breakfast, another for lunch around 1 pm. As of 1:40, no symptoms present. 

## Wednesday, Dec 30th - Thursday, Dec 31st 
Wednesday was about the same as Tuesday, but I felt a little worse because of either A) eating a bite of food here and there, including a french fry, or B) because I had some dairy products, like a keto nutrition shake. If hypothesis B is true, I will know soon because today I fed myself on an Ensure drink and a keto shake, both of which have dairy. 

Today my symptoms have been low like yesterday, but my BM today was watery unlike what it has been so far this flare. I hope that this isn't a sign that the dairy is causing my inflammation to increase again, because I have to sustain myself on dairy products for at least two more days before we get home from our New Year's Eve trip to Ocean Shores. 

## Friday, Jan 1st
Today was much like Thursday. I took shrooms which didn't seem to increase my symptoms that much. I also had miso soup (without rice) for dinner which also didn't increase my symptoms. I think this is a reliable way for me to re-introduce solid food. 

Throughout the day, I had a few bites of cheese puffs, which didn't seem to do much harm. My stomach was rumbly and felt a little bad for a few moments here and there, but seeing as the miso soup went well I don't think my inflammation was triggered that much. 

## Saturday, Jan 2nd - Tuesday, Jan 5th
I've stayed on the liquid diet this whole time, and my symptoms seem to be getting worse very slowly. Tuesday I went and got a MRI and bloodwork done. The MRI was horrible, I had to drink that gross liquid and I was so cold and shivering in the office. Later in the machine I got nauseous and threw up which just sucked. 

My stomach pain and bloating got a lot worse in the afternoon, and I think it was a combination of the medications they had me on and the fact that I drank my shake with peanut butter and soy milk. No more doing that. 

## Wednesday, Jan 6th - Thursday, Jan 7th
My stomach hurt less yesterday than the day before, but was still kind of uncomfortable and I felt bloated and gassy all day. I had a headache in the evening.

Thursday, I felt good in the morning, but was dehydrated. I took my first dose of entocort.

# Hospitalization flare Feb 2020
I had felt that I was recovering well from my Dec 2020 flare, but after a month of budesonide (entocort) it was time to taper from 9 mg down to 6. I forgot to take the steroid for one day, and then the next day I only took 6mg. This was a mistake, as my abdomial pain and nausea returned with a vengence. 

## Saturday, Feb 6th
Abdominal pain, intense nausea. 

## Sunday, Feb 7th
Abdominal pain, vomited twice. 

## Monday, Feb 8th
Abdominal pain, I vomited around noon and made the decision to go to the ER. 

At the ER, i was rehydrated by IV, and they gave me pain relief, although the morphine caused me to vomit again. They prescribed me prednisone and oxycodone. That evening, I took one of my lefover vicodin from the last flare. 

## Tuesday, Feb 9th - Wednesday, Feb 10th
After I got back from the ER, I had a pretty substantial bowl of chicken soup, and I actually felt pretty good for the subsequent two days (Tuesday the 9th, Wednesday the 10th). 

## Thursday, Feb 11th
However, on Thursday, I had a pretty dense smoothie with peanut butter and dairy in it. That sent me into a pain spike, that culminated in me vomiting again. We decided to go to the ER again, since I needed to be hydrated again. 

I was discharged from the ER without needing any pain relief, and had another bowl of chicken soup in the evening. The ER team attributed my symptoms to dehydration, so I was discharged with instructions to stay hydrated at all costs. 

I had a CT scan either this day or the next, I can't remember. I think it was this day. But they didn't see anything crazy anyway. 

## Friday, Feb 12th
The next day, I made this my singular goal. I drank six glasses of water before noon, but I still threw up and had abdominal pain. At this point, I was very demoralized and we headed to the ER *again*. 

This time, the ER team decided to keep me at the hospital overnight for further treatment. I was checked into a room, and kept on an IV to rehydrate me.

I was switched to IV prednisone.

## Saturday, Feb 13th
The next morning, I woke up and was visited by the on-call gastroenterologist. I was on a clear liquid diet that included broth and jello. I didn't have much stomach pain, although there was some action when I had too much dairy in the evening.

## Sunday, Feb 14th
Second day in the hospital. Still hooked up to the fluids, and getting IV pred still. The decision was made to perform a exploratory colonoscopy on Monday since they didn't do that sort of thing on the weekends. 

## Monday, Feb 15th
I had the colonoscopy in the morning, where they went into my small bowel to investigate the source of the symptoms that weren't showing up on the CT scan. The idea was that if I had a stricture that was causing the pain, they could use a balloon to try and stretch the scar tissue out.

However, they actually found *ulcers!* So they didn't end up really *treating* any of the ulcers, they just took a couple biopsies and did some more bloodwork. 

Afterwards, I talked with the on-call gastroenterologist, who said that I was gonna get put on Remicade instead of Entyvio. Bye Entyvio! However, we had to wait for some tests to clear me for Remicade. So the plan was to wait for those tests to get recieved on Tuesday morning, and then give me my first Remicade infusion on Tuesday and send me home. 

I experimented with pushing my diet to be more nutritious, and ran into 5/10 stomach pain and bloating when I had a meal of mashed potatoes, honey nut cheerios w soy milk, another soy milk, and an italian ice.
