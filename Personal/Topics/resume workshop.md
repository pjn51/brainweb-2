# Resume Workshop
`TAGS:`

---
These are my notes from the resume workshop we took during Metis. 
- A resume is a billboard, not a detailed information source. 
- Resumes need to be built for the sorting algorithms that toss out most resumes before recruiters even see them. 
- Include info about how you collaborate across teams and fields. 

## Biggest Mistakes
- Some resumes lack direction and have irrelevant information. When we include our experience, focus on transferrable skills rather than the mundane tasks that won't apply to a [[data science]] role. 
- Make sure the font is easy to read. Use *sans serif*. 
- Don't have too much detailed information. Recruiters spend 15 seconds on your resume. 
- Not enough info. Make sure that there's enough to go off of. 

## Ideal resume
- Clean
- Streamlined
- Easy and fast to read
- Focused, relevant information

## Things to include
- Contact info ==including city and zip==
- Skills
	- Programming langs, stats techniques, [[machine learning]] skills, software packages, etc
	- Especially important for data science since its's so technical
	- Don't rate yourself, just list the skills. 
- Projects and publications
	- Anything that's relevant, nothing that isn't. 
	- Especially important if you have limited work experience
- Relevant [[career]] experience
	- Go back 7-10 years
	- Make sure to include metis! That counts

## Not necessary to include
- Summary
	- Unless you need to create a narrative about yourself
- Volunteer experience
- Hobbies

## Do NOT include
- Objective statement
- Picture
- Awards and recognition
	- These are important but should be built into your experience section
- References
	- Keep these to yourself until the recruiter talks to you first
- Self-rating or subjective scales and stuff
	- Don't assume that the recruiter has a shared understanding of what "proficient" means
	- Just list the skill, then you and the recruiter can talk more in-depth

## Things to remember
- Write outcome-oriented bullet points
	- "Managed day to day activities of seven corporate accounts that raised $2.1 million in new business" is much better than "Managed day to day activites of corporate accounts"
	- "Built a [[flask]] application for the client that led to a 15% increase in site traffic" is better than "Built a flask application for the client"
- Resume should be one page only
- Be consistent with styling and punctuation
- Correct grammar
- Showcase tasks and results
- Use [creddle](https://content.creddle.io/) so that you can focus on the content and then style it multiple different ways. 

## Cover letter
- We have to write cover letters, even though they suck.
- It's time consuming, but recruiters actually do read them. 
- This is especially important if you're submitting a resume *cold* or using an online application without talking to a recruiter. 
- Gives us an opportunity to share our story beyond the resume

## Cover letter structure
- First paragraph
	- First paragraph must be customized. Keep it between 5 and 7 sentences. Talk about something specific to the company that stands out to you, and what stands out to you about the position. 
	- This is where the most work is done per application. 
- The body
	- The body should be 1-2 paragraphs. We can create a standard body that we amend based on the company. 
	- Write a blurb about each project you worked on and all past experience
	- The job description is your cheat sheet that you should use when amending the cover letter. 
- Last paragraph
	- Thanks for the opportunity, here's my contact info
	- No need to customize. 

## Cover letter considerations
- Tell your story
- Mirror the job description
- Tie skill set to the job
- Answer why you would be a good fit for the role
