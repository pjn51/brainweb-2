# Introduction
This will be the organizing note for current health insurance information, as well as other healthcare-related information and links.

# Insurance
I'm currently recieving dual insuance through [[Atos]] and Apple Health. I have it set up so that it runs through my work insurance first, and then the leftover is paid by the Medicaid program. 

# Vision
My prescription can be found in my local health files. I'm going to a vision place right across the street, I forget the name. 

# Dental
Right now I'm going to Mt. Baker Dental. Their number is (206) 588-2692. They're only open on Tuesdays and Thursdays for some reason. 

# Primary
I go to the Swedish clinic on Broadway. My PCP was Dr. Wong, but she left so I need to re-establish care. 

# Vaccinations
I've received three doses of the Pfizer [[COVID-19]] vaccine. 

I received a tetanus booster in August 2021. 

I learned from my infusion in May 2022 that I have immunity to Hep B, and therefore don't require further vaccination. 

# Bone clinic
My doctor at the UW bone clinic is Dr. Ott. This is where I get treatment for [[osteoperosis]].
