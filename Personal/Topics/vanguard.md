# The Proletarian Vanguard
---
The vanguard is the section of the most determined and class-conscious members of the [[proletariat]]. The goal of Marxist organizations is to weld together all elements in this vanguard, and use it as a tool to elevate the [[class consciousness]] of, and lead the movement of the working class. 

The errors that must be avoided in this mission are [[opportunism]], [[sectarianism]] and [[ultraleftism]].
