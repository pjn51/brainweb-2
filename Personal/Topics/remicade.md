# Remicade
---
# Introduction
Remicade is a biologic [[drugs|medication]] for [[Crohn's disease]]. 

A standard dose is about 5mg per kilogram body weight. 

# Cost
I get around 250 mL of medicine each infusion, and it costs $17,000 for the medication. That means the remicade costs $68 per mL. Infusions last around an hour and a half, meaning that I'm recieving $2.36 worth of medicine per second on average. That's $141.60 / minute. 

One milk jug of remicade would cost $272,000. 

Per year, I take about 1.5 L of medicine, costing $102,000. 

# Function
The medication is a chimeric monoclonal antibody biologic. It works by binding to and neutralizing [[TNF]]-$\alpha$, a chemical messenger and a key part of the autoimmune reaction.

The medication is a human-mouse antibody. 

# Effectiveness
For Crohn's, there are two phenotypes that have different response rates when it comes to remicade. For fistulizing disease, a 94-patient trial in 1999 showed that between 56% and 68% of patients who recieved remicade had their fistulae close. A larger, 256-patient study showed a 66% effectiveness rate in maintaining closure after 14 weeks, and 36% maintained closure after 1 year. This should be compared to the 19% closure rate for placebo treatment. 

For inflammatory Crohn's, remicade induced remission in 39% to 45% of patients after 30 weeks, compared with 21% of those who weren't treated. It also increased the mean duration of remission from 21 weeks to 38-54 weeks. 

# Profitability
The company that markets remicade is called Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. In 2013, J&J reported that sales of remicade accounted for 9.4% of the company's total revenue that year. That amounts to around $6.7 billion. If I'm paying an average amount for my medicine, that means that around 67,000 people around the world take remicade each year.
