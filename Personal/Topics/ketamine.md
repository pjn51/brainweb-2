Ketamine is a psychadelic and dissociative [[drugs]], which is usually injected, taken orally, or snorted. 

When snorted, a social dose would be around 0.25 mg/lb. For 135 lbs, that's equal to 34 mg. A solid psychadelic dose would be around 0.5 to 1.0 mg/lb. For 135 lbs, that's between 67.5 mg and 135 mg. 

People often do smaller bumps of ketamine at frequent intervals until desired effects are achieved. This results in greater absorption of the ketamine. 

When taken orally, 1.0 - 2.0 mg/lb of ketamine is mixed with a little hot water to dissolve it.  The cup is filled with juice and drank. 

# Setting and preparation 
At low doses, ketamine can be taken in a club or party setting, and at high doses, ketamine should be taken in a dimly lit room, lying down, with no need for much movement. 

Ketamine can cause nausea so you shouldn't eat for 90 min before you take it. 

# Duration
When snorted, ketamine kicks in in about 5 or 10 minutes. When taken orally, it can take 10 minutes to an hour depending on how full your stomach is. 

The main effects come on strong, and will last for about 30-45 minutes when snorted, or about 90 minutes when taken orally. 

 # Effects at a low dose
At a low dose, ketamine causes the user to experience mild inebriation, stumbling, dreaminess, and increased sociability. 

Some people call ketamine "hippy cocaine," but we should [[Never confuse content and form]], and I would say that while ketamine looks like coke, and you snort it, it's more like alcohol at a low dose than cocaine.

# High dose effects
The high dose experience is more of a psychadelic trip. The user experiences reality "fracturing" and may feel like they're leaving their body at a higher dose.
