# Ethics ðŸ˜‡ ðŸ‘¿
---
Ethics is a subject of inquiry in [[philosophy]], dealing with what we ought or ought not do. 

The basic divide in ethics is between deontology and consequentalism. [[deontology]] argues for [[Deontology proposes universal ethical rules|univeral ethical rules]], while [[consequentialism]] argues that we should judge actions based on outcome. [[Marxist ethics]] are closer to the latter school of thought, while [[Kantian ethics are deontological]]. 

There are also various ethical systems based on [[religion]], such as [[Buddhist ethics]]. 

I believe that [[Morality is historically contingent]], and fall closer to the camp of [[consequentialism]] as a result of that. I think [[Deontology is anti-dialectical]] because it ignores context of actions.
