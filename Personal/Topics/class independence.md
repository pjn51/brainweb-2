# Introduction
Class independence is the principle that the movement of the working class should only stand on its own two feet. The forces of [[Marxism]], as well as [[mass organizations]] of the working class should not base themselves off the support or assistance of the [[bourgeoisie]]. [[Workers need their own party]]. 

# Why is it important?
First of all, if we rely on the support of the bourgeoisie, the moment we truly threaten the bourgeoisie, then they will withdraw all their support, and will instead bring down the full fury of their institutions upon is. All that we have achieved due to their help will crumble into dust. 

Second of all, our reliance on the [[bourgeoisie]] confuses the class [[class consciousness]] of the working class. The most important mission of the [[vanguard]] is to help the workers to see that they have the power to run society, and to challenge the ruling class. If we rely on the ruling class for our small victories along the way, this makes the workers less confident in themselves. This is far too high a price to pay for the meager advances we can make by relying on the bourgeoisie. 

There have been huge disasters when the workers movement has leaned on the bourgeoisie in times of crisis. In [[China]], the [[CPC]] allied with the national bourgeoisie when fighting against [[Japan|Japanese]] agression. When the tide turned, the national bourgeoisie massacred the Communists, forcing the leadership to turn to the [[peasantry]] for a mass base. A similar situation happened in [[Indonesia]]. 

# How to achieve it
First of all, we should never take any [[currency|money]] from the bourgeoisie. That's pretty basic. Also, all the leadership of the organization should take no more than a skilled workers wage in the area they live. This ensures that no layer of our organizations start to be influenced by alien class interests. 

This tactic has a second benefit, in that when the workers see that our representatives in the legislature (at a certain stage in our development) are refusing to take the high salaries that come with that position, it increases our credibility. 

If we are working in another organization, we can encourage these policies be taken up through the tactic of [[Marxists should use positive demands]].
