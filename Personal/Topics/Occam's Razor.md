# Introduction
This is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] heuristic that advocates simplicity. This concept proposes that when presented with multiple hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the one with the fewest assumptions. 

In science, Occam's razor is used as a heuristic in the development of theoretical models. Since there are an infinite range of possible hypotheses that can explain a given result, this is a useful tool to select the most likely ones that should be further investigated.

For example, a scientist sees that when a ball is dropped, it falls to the floor. One explanation is that gravity is working as we normally understand it. But another possibility would be that gravity temporarily reversed, and God himself forced the ball to fall despite the lack of gravity. The latter hypothesis assumes a lot more, and should therefore be discarded based on Occam's razor.
