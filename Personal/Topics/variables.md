# Variables
`TAGS:`

---
# In [[Python]]
## Variable conventions
- Variables should not include dots or any reserved keywords such as ‘lambda.’ Also, make sure that variables don't start with a number. 
- Multi-variable names should use underscores. If ‘kent’ is part of the dataset ‘clark,’ call it `clark_kent`. 
- Make variable names as descriptive as possible. 

## Variable assignment
- A variable must equal something, but that value can be blank if you just want to create an empty [[data]] structure. 
- We can chain assignments, assigning the same value to multiple variables at the same time. 
	`clark = bruce = ‘superheroes’` for example. 
- We can also say `a, b = 1, 2` to make a equal to 1 and b equal to 2.
- We can increase a variable by x by saying `variable += x `
