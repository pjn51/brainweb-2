# Introduction
Asking a question is the first step in the classic data sci workflow. It's important to start with a question we want to answer, or a problem we want to solve in order to make sure that our work is actually useful. In the private sector, we aren't just researching interesting things or trying to create models for fun. 

Since we are going to have to present our findings to management or to clients, we need to have a firm grounding in *why* we are pursuing this topic or issue. 

Scoping a potential question is also important. You want to know generally how hard a problem will be to solve, and make sure that's an amount of effort that you're willling to invest (and an amount of resources that your client or boss is willing to invest).
