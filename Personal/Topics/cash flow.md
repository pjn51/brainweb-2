# Cash Flow


---
## Introduction
Cash flow is an essential feature of the [[stash-o-matic project]] project. The overall goal is to maximize cash flow by tweaking variable expenses. 

$C = S - E$ 
... Where *C* is cash flow, *S* is sales, and *E* is expenses.

$S = S_a + S_b + ... + S_n$ ... Where *n* is the product you sell

$E = E_c + E_v$ 	
... Where $E_c$ is constant expenses, and $E_v$ are variable expenses.

$E_v = E_s + E_p + E_m$ 	
... Where $E_s$ are shipping-related costs, $E_p$ are purchasing costs, and $E_m$ are marketing costs. $E_e$ are other costs.

So overall...

$$
C = (S_a + S_b + ... + S_n) - (E_c + E_s + E_p + E_m + E_e)
$$
