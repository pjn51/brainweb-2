# COINTELPRO


---
COINTELPRO was an FBI program aimed at left-wing organizations. Short for counter-intelligence program, the mission was to surveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt the targeted organizations.

# History
The program officially began in 1956, targeted at [[CPUSA]]. Tactics included anonymous phone calls, IRS audits, and attempts to internally divide the leadership. 

Later, Black civil-rights activists were included in the program, under the excuse that the movement had been infiltrated by Communists. After 1963, MLK was a central target of the organization. They began to bug King's home and hotel rooms, in the search for incriminating material. They recorded evidence of him cheating on his wife, and sent him a letter telling him to kill himself or the information would be released. He did not, and the FBI commenced a media campaign to smear King. 

The [[Black Panther Party]] was also targeted by this operation, and [[Huey P. Newton]] was most likely assasinated with the direct assistance of agents working under the COINTELPRO mandate. 

[[Malcolm X]] was also targeted by the program. The FBI deliberatley worked to widen the rift between him and the Nation of Islam, a member of which eventually murdered him.
