# Introduction
By "the academy," I mean the specific political tendency of academics like  [[Federici]], [[Dave Harvey]], and [[Chomsky]], who tend to have a very specific political outlook. I don't want to honor them by referring to them as "academic Marxists," since I think it does a disservice to [[Marxism]] to tie that epitaph to their ideas, which are frankly terrible, especially since they stake their careers on the worth of their ideas and words. 

Always remember that [[Marxists who don't organize shouldn't be taken seriously]]. 

# Social position of the academy
The academic milieu resembles the [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]], and [[The petty bourgeois political method is toxic]].
