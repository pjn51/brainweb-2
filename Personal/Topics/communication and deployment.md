# Communication and Deployment
`TAGS:`

## Communication
This is the "last" step in the [[data science workflow]]. We have to communicate our results using [[metrics]] that are useful for other people's decisions. This means knowing how to give good [[presentations]], and using the correct model metric for the situation. 

Also see the concept of [[We should work with the garage door open]]. Maybe I should be incorporating some kinds of social media communication into my projects. 

## Deployment
This is not *technically* part of the standard workflow for [[data science]] projects, but it's good to understand where [[data science]] fits in with the larger workflow of projects. 

We can use [[flask]] or [[streamlit]] to translate [[Python]] to something that a web server can read. 

*Heroku* is a good option for hosting web apps. 

For an introduction, see my [[2-3-21 metis]] notes on model deployment.
