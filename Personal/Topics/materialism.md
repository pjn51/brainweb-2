# Materialism
---
# Introduction
Materialism is the belief that [[The material world exists]], and matter acts as the primary force in the universe, molding human thought and belief patterns. This seems obvious, but an large amount of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] political [[philosophy]] is based on the opposite claim, that of [[idealism]]. 

Materialism, when combined with [[dialectics]], forms the basis of Marxist philosophy, [[dialectical materialism]]. When applied to the course of human history, materialism forms the basis of [[historical materialism]].

# Materialism in Marxist philosophy
Some accuse Marxism of *vulgar materialism,* and say that Marxism is deterministic for this reason. However, [[Marxism isn't deterministic]], and does recognize the role of free will and individual choices.
