# Strategies
## Introduction
I want to compile my thoughts and strategies on the online game Warzone.

## Politics
Choose your allies carefully, and your enemies even more carefully. 

Only trust an ally as far as their own self interest aligns with your friendship. 

## Offense
Always attack where you enemy is weakest. When performing a sneak attack, seek to disrupt as many bonuses as possible.

## Defense
Pick your battles wisely. The rigid tree snaps in the storm, while the limber branch survives.
