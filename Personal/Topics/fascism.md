[[What is fascism?]]

# The Conditions for the Emergence of Fascism
In order for fascism to emerge, there have to be a few preconditions. Since [[Fascism has a petty bourgeois base]], the [[petty bourgeoisie]] must have a mass character. 

Even with a mass movement of the petty bourgeoisie, the working class is much larger and theoretically more powerful. This means that the working class movement has to have been recently defeated, or has to have such bad leadership to prevent them from fighting off fascism, which the workers naturally reject.

# Fascism in the USA
Many people talk about how this or that US politician is a fascist. As covered above, Marxists view fascism as a social phenomenon that doesn't exist independently of a certain material context. 

Therefore, we can confidently say that fascism is not a threat to the working class of the US, because the social conditions for the emergence of fascism do not exist. If a counter-revolution emerged in the [[USA]], it would be more similar to the coup in [[Bolivia]] than to the reign of the [[Nazi Party]]. 

# Fascism in Germany and Italy
Fascism arose in [[Germany]] at a time where the German Revolution had just been defeated. The advanced workers were tired of fighting and were demoralized, just having been betrayed by their [[reformism|social democratic]] leadership. This allowed the Nazis to enter into this power vaccum, helped along by the [[bourgeoisie]] who viewed the situation as a choice between [[Hitler]] and socialist revolution. 

A similar situation happened in [[Italy]], where the [[reformism]] of the workers' leaders betrayed the revolutionary upsurge in the 20s and opened the door for fascist counter-revolution.
