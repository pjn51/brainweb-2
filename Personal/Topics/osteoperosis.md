 # Osteoperosis ðŸ¦´
---
Osteoperosis is also known as low bone density. Those with [[Crohn's disease]] are at higher risk.

The WHO defines a normal [[z-score]] as within 2 standard deviations from normal bone density. 

These results mean that I am over 2 [[standard deviation]] below the mean bone density for my age group, putting me in the 1st percentile for bone density.
