Maoism is the revolutionary legacy of [[Mao]]'s ideas. There is also something called Mao Zedong Thought, which I don't know anything about. 

Some Maoists take a Third Worldist position on revolutionary potential. [[Third Worldism is counter-revolutionary]]. 

When [[Collaborationism doomed China's 1927 revolution]], the [[CPC]] was forced to base itself off the [[peasantry]]. Because of this, [[Maoism was a product of proletarian defeat]]. Despite severe difficulties, [[The CPC led the peasants to victory in 1949]]. 

## Literature Related to Maoism
- [[Settlers - The Mythology of the White Proletariat (1983)]] <- very flawed account of the history of the [[USA]]
- [[On Contradiction (1937)]] <- overview of [[dialectical materialism]] according to Mao. Has some flaws.
- [[Does Maos Combat Liberalism Actually Combat Liberalism (2019)]] <- a critique of Maoism
