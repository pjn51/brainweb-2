# Introduction
Ireland is a small island to the west of the [[UK]]. It was one of the first colonies of the British Empire, and has a long tradition of resistance and fighting for national liberation - a struggle that continues to this day. This tradition brought us figures like [[Connolly]]. 

# English occupation
The UK has had a military presence on the island as far back as the 1100s. The 1175 Treaty of Windsor was the first recognition of English rule over parts of Ireland. In 1801, the two countries of Great Britain and Ireland were formally merged, into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 

The union with the UK, at the beginning of the industrial revolution, stagnated Irish economic development. The island became part of the much more advanced British economy, and became a source of raw materials and agricultural produce. 

# The Great Famine
Between 1845 and 1851, the Irish population fell by 1/3rd. More than a million people died of starvation and disease, and another million fled the country. 

# Rebellions
The Irish launched many rebellions against British rule. The first prominent one was the Easter Rising of 1916. It was led by a group known as the Irish Volunteers, who opposed Irish involvement in [[WW1]] and advocated for an independent Ireland. It failed and fifteen leaders of the Rising were executed, with thousands imprisoned. The harsh treatment of the rebels galvanized Irish nationalism across the island. 

The nationalist party [[Sinn Fein]] gained massively in the 1918 general elections, and the Irish Volunteers, now known as the Irish Republican Army, or [[IRA]], began a guerella war against the British. 

# Partition
In 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty gave Ireland complete independence in domestic affairs and de-facto independence overall, but allowed the six northern counties to opt-out. These counties did opt out, and became Northern Ireland. 

There was an ensuing civil war in the Irish Free State over the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which had some stipulations. This war ended in 1923 with a cease-fire by those who opposed the Treaty terms with the British. 

# Independence
The Irish Free State gradually declared more and more independence from the UK, and formally proclaimed itself as the totally-independent Republic of Ireland in 1949.
