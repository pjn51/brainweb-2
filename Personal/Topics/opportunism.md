# Introduction
Opportunism is a common error among working class movements. Opportunists water down the principles of revolution and Marxism generally in order to win power within whatever immediate conditions they find themselves in.

For example, today in 2020, calling for the overthrow of the state and capitalism isn't going to get me much support. An opportunist would water these positions down to make them more appetizing for the workers today with their low level of class [[class consciousness]] and lack of revolutionary conclusions. 

The role of the vanguard is to seek to elevate the political consciousness of the working class, not adapt their demands and principles to whatever that level of consciousness happens to be at the time. 

This error is fundamentally because of a failure to think [[dialectical materialism|dialectically]]. If we want power, a non-dialetical outlook would assert we have to do things that will gain us power under the conditions that exist today. However, we know that the conditions that exist today are not static. Once they change, the conditions which we were adapted to will desert us, and we will be doomed. However, if we prepare for the new conditions that we know will eventually arise, we will be prepared for them and able to take power under *those* condtions. 

# Class collaborationism
Related to opportunism, class collaborators advocate that workers should lean on the help of the ruling class, and not attempt to form organizations on the basis of working class support alone. This is a deeply pessimistic outlook that ignores the fact that the working class, once mobilized, is far more powerful than all other classes combined. 

However, this is a tempting prospect in a situation where the working class is not mobilized, and the ruling class has the ability to gate-keep nearly every bourgeois institution.
