Structural Expressionism is a school of late modern architecture that is also known as high-tech architecture. It developed in the 1970s, in the context of a declining interest in [[brutalism]].

It seeks to incorporate elements of high tech industry and technology into the design of buildings. It seeks transparency, showing the underlying structure and function of buildings throughout the interior and exterior.

Aesthetically, these structures seek to make use of materials reminiscent of industrial production, like steel, glass, and concrete. 

On the interior, these buildings tend to have an open floor plan with a large central area, serviced by smaller surrounding maintenance spaces. Service and maintainance elements such as ventilation ducts and air conditioners are often left visible.
