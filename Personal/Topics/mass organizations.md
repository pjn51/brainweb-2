# Mass Organizations


---
## What is a mass organization?
The working class is capable of forming spontaneous organizations on multiple levels. At the most local, atomic scale, [[mutual aid]] networks and hobbyist societies emerge. At the level of the individual workplace, [[unions]]. In the political arena, the [[workers' party]] is the proletarian organization. 

There isn't a linear schema of development that we can follow, but in the past the labor movement has moved into the political arena and formed workers' parties, and the reverse has also happened.

## What makes it a *mass* organization?
There isn't a black and white answer to this, but mass orgsanizations are those which the [[proletariat]] feels represented in. They also have internal democratic structures so that the masses can make their voices heard to at least some extent.

## Orientation of the Marxists
As outlined in [[Problems of Entrism (1959)]] and [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]], Marxists shouldn't form parties opposed to working class parties, but should try and give expression to the revolutionary currents within these parties. We should try to harden and weld together the most advanced workers within these organizations, fighting the leaderships which are often representative of [[reformism]].

[[Revolutionary parties tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations]].
