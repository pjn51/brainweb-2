## Sixes According to the Enneagram Institute
[[Eylen]] is a type six. This type is called ==The Loyalist==. It is a committed, security-oriented type that can be engaging, responsible, anxious, and suspicious. 

==Basic [[fear]]==: being without support or guidance.
==Basic Desire==: to have security and support. 

==Key Motivation==: to have security and feel reassured and supported by others. They want to test the attitudes of others towards them and fight anxiety and insecurity. 

==Famous sixes==: Mark Twain, Prince Harry, Rush Limbaugh. 

Out of all the types, sixes are most loyal to their friends and their beliefs. They will hang on to relationships more than most. They are also fiercly loyal to their beliefs, even when this gets them into trouble. 

Their intense loyalty comes from a desire to avoid being abandoned by others. The central issue for sixes is a failure of self-confidence. They tend to believe that they can't handle life alone, and get around this by relying on alles and structures to help them. 

Sixes also tend to be bundles of opposites. Since they have trouble with doubting themselves, they tend to vaccilate from one extreme to another. Sixes will often be both aggressive and passive, both thinkers and doers, both tender and mean, both generous and stingy.
