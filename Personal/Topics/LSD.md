# Introduction
LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, is a psychadelic [[drugs|drug]]. 

# History
LSD was first created by Albert Hofmann in 1938, but the psychadelic properties of the chemical were only discovered in 1943. 

Beginning in the 1950s, the [[CIA]] began to research the possibilities of using LSD for mind control. This program was called [[MKUltra]]. The agency purchased $240,000 worth of LSD, which was practically the entire world's supply at the time, and brought the LSD to the [[USA]] through CIA front organizations. 

The study was conducted by administering LSD to CIA employees, soldiers, doctors, other government personnel, mental patients, and members of the public, usually without their knowledge or consent. This was revealed in a Congressional inquiry in 1975. 

After LSD became associated with the 60s counter-culture, it was made illegal in 1968. 

In 2020, Oregon became the first US state to decriminalize LSD posession.

# Dosage
A single dose of LSD ranges between 50 and 500 $\mu$g. Threshold effects can be felt after as little as 25 $\mu$g. The most common street dose hovers around 100 $\mu$g. 

# Production and distribution
Due to the small dose, 5-6 kg of crystal LSD, made from 25 kg of precursor, can produce around 50-60 million doses at 100 $\mu$g each. 

However, LSD is usually produced in a series of small batches, so that less precursor is wasted in case a step goes wrong. 

In the US, manufacturers fall into one of two groups: a few large-scale producers, and a few small clandestine chemists who work on a limited scale. 

Many producers describe a [[religion|religious]] or humanitarian intention behind their production of LSD. 

Sometimes, dealers will substitite mimics instead of LSD. A common one is [[25I-NBOMe]], which has been linked with several deaths.

# Effects
[[Psychadelics are relatively harmless]].
