# Surplus Value


---
## Introduction
Surplus value is a central concept of [[Marxism|Marxist]] economics. Surplus value is the [[value]] created by [[labor]]-power which exceeds the cost of the labor-power purchased in order to create it. Under [[capitalism]], this surplus is appropriated by the [[bourgeoisie]], and is either pocketed as profit or used to pay for the overhead required for business.
