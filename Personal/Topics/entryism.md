The role of a revolutionary party is fundamentally about orienting to the [[mass organizations]] of the [[proletariat]], through which the working class becomes politically active. 

Entrism is a #tactic to build support for the ideas of Marxism within these organizations, aiming to gain control of the leadership of the organization. 

In order to carry this out, the formal organization has to be dissolved and internal structures must be covert, as well as membership. 

This should only be used as an advanced tactic, because the secretive methods will only be able to outmanuver the bureaucracy for a little while, and will eventually be expelled if they can't win over enough support inside the party. 

# Validity of entrism
As it says in [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]],

> The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties....The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others...

To me, this passage clearly shows the validity of entrism as a tactic. Of course, not in all circumstances though. 

# Conditions for entrism
As outlined in [[Problems of Entrism (1959)]], the conditions for entrism are... 
1. Pre-revolutionary or revolutionary situation
2. Ferment in Social Democracy
3. Development of a left wing
4. The possibility of the rapid crystallisation of the revolutionary tendency
