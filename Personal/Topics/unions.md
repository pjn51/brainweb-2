# Unions
---
The unions are an important mode of organization of the [[proletariat]]. They are the first lines of working class defense in the cases where they are present. 

## History of the unions in the USA
During the postwar boom in the [[USA]], and amidst an attack on the left during McCarthyism, there was a purge of leftists in the unions. This was possible because of the strong current of [[reformism]] that the upswing in [[capitalism]] laid the basis for. 

There was a resulting decrease in the scope of the labor movement. Union density began to decrease in the private sector, and increase in the public sector. 

In 1983, there was 21% union density, down from 40%. Today, the union density is 10.3%! Also, most of the unions today are in the public sector (density is 33% in the public sector, 6% in private). 

The idea of having a defined-benefit pension is really a thing of the past, because of the decrease in union power. 

## How Marxists operate in the unions
Marxists start from a perspective totally different from the current leaders. We see that all wealth comes from the [[labor]] of the workers, and that we don't need the capitalists to run society.

Marxists understand the strategy of mass mobilization, unification of workers, solidarity with all other workers, and organizing the unemployed. This has helped many unions with Marxist [[cadre]] in them to greatly expand their influence. 

Marxists also understand that the economic fight is linked with the political fight. The unions need a political apparatus, a [[workers' party]] that can unite their struggles and elevate them. 

Marxists should seek to create an alternative leadership within the unions. By providing an alternative vision, we can show the workers that another way is possible. Again and again, as their [[reformism|reformist]] leadership betrays them, our position will become stronger and stronger.

## Positive demands
When the trade union leadership is corrupt or going against [[class independence]], then we need to skillfully point this out without alienating the base who may still have illusions in the leadership based on their own experiences.

In order to do this, we place [[Marxists should use positive demands]] on the leadership, instead of simply standing to the side and criticizing them. If the leadership gives way to these demands, we will have won a victory, and if they don't, they will expose themselves as having different interests than those of the workers. 

For example, the plan floated by the Reform and Revolution caucus of the [[DSA]] in the event of [[Trump]] trying to steal the election was to call on the union leadership to declare a general strike. We were under no illusion that the union tops would want to do this, but we call on them to do it anyway. If they don't, this will reveal to the rank-and-file that the tops are not what they say they are. 

## Strikes
A strike is a basic weapon of the union. By depriving the bosses of their labor in a specific shop, firm, or even industry, the workers can make use of their leverage as the class which creates all value (see the [[labor theory of value]]).

## The general strike
A general strike is the highest form of the strike tactic. By organizing enough of the working class in general, a strike in all industries can be called. The committees that often emerge to manage such activity can even be used to pose the question of who ought to run society.
