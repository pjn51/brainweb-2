# Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Germany has a long history of revolutionary upheaval. [[The failure of the German revolution was the Soviet death certificate]], but nobody at the time knew it yet. 

# The revolution of 1918-19
Soldiers and workers rose up in opposition to [[WW1]], but they placed their faith in the traditional [[workers' party]], the [[SPD]]. The SPD purposefully diffused the energy of the movement, and handed power back to the [[bourgeoisie]]. 

The [[Spartacists]] pursued a course of [[ultraleftism]], refusing to participate in elections. They later tried to lead an uprising and were massacred. This led to the deaths of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Liebknecht]]. 

# The revolution of 1921
The failure of the German revolution, and later the inability of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[KPD]] to fight against the Nazis led to the rise of [[fascism]] in Germany. This was in part due to the fact that [[The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s]].
