# Sugar 


---
# Introduction
I really want to kick my habit of consuming too much processed sugar. I know that it's an inflammatory, and it's just bad for you in general!

# My experience
For those with [[Crohn's disease]], sugar is an inflammatory. I've noticed that when I consume lots of sugar, I tend to feel worse the next day. I usually have diarrhea the next day when I've gone overboard.
