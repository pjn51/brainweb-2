# Introduction
This topic is all about tools like [[Obsidian]] and how we can best use them to manage our store of knowledge. As is obvious, I find this interesting and useful.

There are a few different frameworks that people like. The ones I've heard of are the [[zettelkasten method]], [[PARA]], and the [[IMF framework]]. 

I think PKM and artificial intelligence have a lot of potential when paired. I recently learned of a project called Dual. The idea is to train a [[transformer]] on your vault notes, and use that to create a personal assistant with your knowledge base! What a sick idea.
