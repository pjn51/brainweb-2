# Economism


---
# Historical context
Economism was a trend in the workers' movement in [[Russia]] in the years before the 1905 revolution. 

# Ideas
The economists believed that workers were only concerned with economic goals, and that any attempt to move workers into political action was unfounded. This led them to create two wings of their organizations: the workers' side, which focused on purely economic agitation, and the intellectual side, where the intelligentsia and [[petty bourgeoisie]] discussed theory that was supposedly too complex for the workers to understand.
