# Marxist ethics

# Introduction
There have been lots of arguments about the personal ethical stance of [[Marx]] and [[Marxism]] generally. He didn't really call capitalism 'unjust' or talk in moral terms when he was describing it as a system. Nor did he talk about [[communism]] in explicitly moral terms. This is because Marx understood that morality, like all [[philosophy]], is an outgrowth of the ruling class's perspective. Therefore, the current ruling morality is the morality that benefits the [[bourgeoisie]], and flows from their perspective. 

Some said that because of this, Marx chose not to critique [[capitalism]] on moral grounds at all. Others disagreed, and said that Marx counterposed the ruling ideas of morality with the moral ideals of the [[proletariat]], and that these moral ideas were the moral theories of communist society. Marx, coming from a proletarian perspective, would agree that capitalism is immoral. This perspective cannot account for why Marx never actually said capitalism was immoral though. 

While Marx never talked in explicitly moral terms, he referred to 'embezzlement,' 'robbery,' and 'theft' when talking about capitalism. 

Fundamentally, the issue is that the language of moral [[philosophy]] is a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] langauge, as this philosophy exists within, and is shaped by, the ideas of the ruling class. Therefore, Marx made an effort to base his ideas on other foundations, such as economics and [[historical materialism]], instead of trying to adapt the ideas of bourgeois philosophy, which are fundamentally idealist in addition to being part of the capitalist [[The dialectic of base and superstructure|superstructure]]. 

There are various tactical issues with [[moralism]] that Marxists should avoid.
