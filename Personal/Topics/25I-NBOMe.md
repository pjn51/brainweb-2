# 25I-NBOMe


---
25I-NBOMe is a synthetic hallucigenic [[drugs|drug]]. It was discovered in 2003, and entered recreational markets around 2010.

Due to its cheaper manufacturing cost, it is often substituted by dealers for [[LSD]]. 

## Dosage

It has similar effects to LSD, but users report more negative effects and more risk of harm following use when compared to LSD. 

Case reports of seven people who were hospitalized due to 25I-NBOMe overdose indicate that seizures, hypertension, and other effects are possible. 

A harmful dose has never been established for 25I-NBOMe, and there have been at least 19 reports of deaths linked to the drug in the [[USA]].
