# The Labor Theory of Value
---
The labor theory of value, the central [[economics|economic]] theory of [[Marxism]], argues that [[labor]] is the source of all [[exchange value]] for reproducible [[commodities]].

The simplest way that I would explain this is that obviously labor creates value. If labor did not create value, why would a company hire any employees? Obviously, the company is benefiting from hiring you in some way. Knowing that, we can make the logical step to the assertion that your labor increases the value of whatever product you are involved in the production process of, no matter how distant or complex the production process is.
