# Imperialism üåê

## Fundamental theories
[[Lenin defined imperialism around financial domination]], which now constitutes the basic [[Marxism|Marxist]] definition of imperialism. However, there were other competing definitions. [[Kautsky defines imperialism as agrarian expansionism]] instead. [[Lenin criticised Kautsky's definition of imperialism]]. 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]] motivated by the fact that [[Capitalism requires expansion]]. 

I think Lenin's theory has been further validated by the fact that [[An increasing proportion of goods and services travel internationally]], and [[Supply chains are becoming more complex]], as well as how [[Colonial extraction continues today]].

## In relation to war
[[Imperialism drives warfare]]. 

[[Kautsky proposed the theory of ultra-imperialism]]. [[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]], but in my opinion, [[Lenin's critique of ultra-imperialism has flaws]]. 

## Postwar imperialism
Despite the fact that [[The formal colonial system declined after WW2]], [[Postwar "decolonization" was a mirage]] and [[Colonial extraction continues today]].

Instead, local officials manage imperialism in their respective countries. The advanced capitalist countries are not able to compete for these markets, since [[A unipolar world emerged after WW2]]. Due to the fact that [[American empire is in decline]], we would expect to see imperialism become more and more visible. We are beginning to see such a trend, with the US media obsessed with Chinese influence in Southeast Asia and East Africa. 

# The Marxist attitude towards imperialism
Obviously, Marxists need to stand against imperialist domination, and with the oppressed masses of the world, whose lives are made worse by imperialism. However, some organizations, such as the [[PSL]] end up focusing too much on the current form of imperialism, rather than its content. [[Never confuse content and form]]. 

Seeing that the [[USA]] is the dominant imperialist power currently, this group opposes *American* imperialism specifically. For example, they explain away all of the actions of [[China]] in Africa, which demonstrates that China is indeed bound by the same laws of imperialist expansion as the [[USA]]. Also, they support Assad in [[Syria]], demonstrating that they don't stand with the *masses* who suffer under imperialism, they are standing with the national [[bourgeoisie]] who suffer under imperialist domination by the USA specifically. 

# Imperialism and the "progressive bourgeoisie"
Some have said that because of imperialism, the [[proletariat]] can ally with the national bourgeoisie in order to achieve national liberation. However, [[Trotsky]] made an excellent point with his theory of [[permanent revolution]], saying that because the national bourgeoisie is tied to the imperialists through investment and debt, they are incapable of playing a revolutionary role when it comes to even a "bourgeois" revolution of national liberation. 

Because of this, Trotsky says that the task of the historically borgeois revolution has fallen to the proletariat, and since the proletariat will ultimately move past the tasks that the bourgeois revolution asks of it, we should expect the workers to begin to abolish [[capitalism|capitalist]] property relations right after they abolish feudal or imperialist ones.
