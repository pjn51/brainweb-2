# Idealism
---
Idealism is the [[ontology|ontological]] stance that ideas or thought are the prime force in the universe, and matter and the material world are a reflection of this force, standing in opposition to the position of [[materialism]]. However, in my opinion, [[Matter, not idea, is fundamental]]. 

Throughout history, we've seen that [[Idealism and religion are intertwined]]. 

Since the early days of western [[philosophy]], the position has been debated. [[Aristotle criticized idealism]], while [[Plato was an idealist]]. However, [[Aristotle]] wasn't a firm [[materialism|materialist]]. 

[[Idealism ascribes essential attributes]]. Showing a tendency towards this, [[The Enneagram model views type as static]]. 

Since ideas are discussed and transmitted through speech, [[Idealists center discourse]]. 

While I disagree with this position, there have been times that idealism has moved [[philosophy]] forward. [[After Locke, idealists made the advances in thought]] - until [[Marx]], that is.
