## Introduction
Labor is a central term in [[Marxism|Marxist]] economics. According to the [[labor theory of value]], labor is a value-creating force in society. 

## Labor vs labor power
Labor power is distinct from labor. When a member of the [[proletariat]] engages in work, they are selling their labor power, for a certain amount of time, or a certain product of this labor power. Rather than selling the value of their labor itself to the capitalist, the worker sells the potential to create value to the capitalist, they sell their labor power.
