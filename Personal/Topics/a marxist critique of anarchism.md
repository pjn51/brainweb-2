# A Marxist Critique of Anarchism

## On the state
[[Marxism|Marxists]] critique the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] approach towards the [[state]]. While Marxists think that the [[proletariat]] must seize state power and weild it against the remnants of the gobal [[bourgeoisie]], anarchists abstain from using state power, at least in their minds. 

When anarchists have come to power, they have certainly used state power. The state is defined as an instrument of class oppression, and anarchists did oppress the ruling class during the [[Spain|Spanish revolution]], for instance. However, their ideological opposition to using state power prevented them from consolidating their gains, and was one factor in how the [[fascism|fascists]] took power. 

## On organizational forms
Another issue with anarchism is their organizational structures themselves. Anarchists often claim that they have no hierarchies within their organization, and no leaders. However, in any movement natural leaders will arise. Those who are most dedicated, have the most experience, and are the most charismatic will rise to the top with or without a formal position in the organization.

In a centralized "hierarchical" organization, if there is adequate internal democracy, these leaders' decisions are known and the leaders can be removed if they begin to make mistakes or degenerate politically. Without any official structures, the de-facto leadership can hide from any responsibility for their actions, claiming that there are no leaders. 

Another critique of horizontal organizing is the lack of discipline and decisiveness. An organization with no formal structure cannot wage a long-term campaign in the same way that the bourgeois state can. If we want to go up against this state and win, we need to be as organized as they are. We can see examples of this in the late degeneration of [[June 2020 uprising]] in [[Seattle]], where the police routinely out-manuvered the ENDD demonstrators, demoralizing the movement and arresting its most active members. 

## Philisophical differences
Marxists base their thinking in [[dialectical materialism]]. Anarchists tend not to, and can be subject to the influences of [[idealism]] and [[metaphysics]]. For example, anarchists will sometimes take a pessimistic view seeing as most workers aren't radical, for instance in [[Desert (2011)]] where the author states that revolution isn't possible because of the small number of anarchists worldwide. They are failing to see that [[class consciousness]] is a variable, not a constant. Under the pressure of great events, the average worker can be inspired to move into politics.
