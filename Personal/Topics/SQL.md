- [[SQL organizes data in tables]]
- [[SQL primary keys identify rows]]
- [[SQL views function as virtual tables]]

SQL is a standard for accessing and manipulating [[relational databases]] (it's a [[RDBMS]]). While many think it stands for Structured Query Language, [[SQL is not an acronym]]. It is useful for [[database]] management and is commonly used for [[data wrangling]]. 

# When to use SQL
[[SQL is a declarative language]]. [[Declarative programming describes results, not processes]]. This means that it's harder to run SQL statements line-by-line and debug them, but that it's easier to get things done in SQL sometimes. 

# SQL Statements
Can be either [[SQL data statements]] or [[SQL schema statements]]. [[SQL schema statements create database objects, data statements manipulate data]]. 

# Most important statements
- [[SELECT statement]]
- `UPDATE` - updates data in a database
- `DELETE` - removes data from a database
- `INSERT INTO` - inserts new data into a database
- `CREATE DATABASE`
- `ALTER DATABASE`
- `CREATE TABLE`
- `ALTER TABLE`
- `DROP TABLE` - deletes a table
- `CREATE INDEX` - creates a new index (search key)
- `DROP INDEX` - deletes an index
