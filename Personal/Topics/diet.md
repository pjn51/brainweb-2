# Introduction
This is an attempt to work out a dietary system for the treatment of [[Crohn's disease]] flares.

The plan is to establish a range of diets that work for me. Phase 1 is to be followed when I'm currently in a flare, and phase 4 is for when I'm not having any symptoms. This first table is a general rulebook of what I'm allowed to eat during a flare. Phases 1 and 2 have further restrictions on this table, while in phase 4 I'm allowed to make some exceptions.
