I watched a video about the metro construction in Bucharest, where [[Ceausescu]] personally designed the route. His wife urged him to not add a stop for the central city, since there were only students there, and students should be forced to walk instead of ride the metro. The engineers *secretly* built the station, knowing that it would eventually have to be built anyway!
