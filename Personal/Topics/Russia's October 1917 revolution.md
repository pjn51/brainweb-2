# Russia's October 1917 revolution
---
The [[Russia|Russian]] revolution of October 1917 was the first and so far only successful workers' revolution, in which the [[proletariat]] seized [[state]] power.

Coming mere months after [[Russia's February 1917 revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks]] gained power in the Petrograd Soviet due to their steadfast opposition to [[WW1]] and the compromised position of the [[Mensheviks]] who had supported the state. They were thus able to set up and control Military Revolutionary Committees and detachments of Red Guards, who overnight occupied the key points of the city. 

The revolution itself was almost entirely bloodless, +1 to the idea that [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]]. It was only the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] counter-attack of the Civil War that caused death across the country.
