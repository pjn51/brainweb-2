# The Self
---
The self is a common topic in [[philosophy]]. 

The nature of the self is a common topic in [[Buddhism]]. From what I remember, Buddhists view the self as not having any innate characteristics, and therefore say that the self isn't 'real'. But they also wouldn't really say that anything is 'real,' because everything is always changing, and doesn't have any fixed characteristics or innate self.
