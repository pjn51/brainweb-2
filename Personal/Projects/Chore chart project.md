# Chore Chart Project

---
# Overview
I want to create a chore system that helps me stay on top of tasks that I often overlook. It's important to create robust systems because I agree with Clear about systems ([[Prefer systems to goals]]). 

Following his advice, I want to incorporate as many of his laws for behavior change as possible ([[Clear proposes four laws of behavior change]]). 

I also want to make this system adaptive, increasing the reward that I get from tasks that I don't do enough. For instance, I tend to overlook the litter more than I do the kitchen, so that should be accounted for.

Today I'm starting to think about this project, and my first thought is to make a spreadsheet with rows for each chore, and columns for each day. I would check off whenever I do the chore, and then I should tally up the points at the end of the week and reward myself with something. 

First thing first, I have to decide what chores should be on the chart, and then decide what points to give them. 

- Clean the litter
- Take out the trash
- Clean the kitchen
- Clean the bedroom
- Clean the shower

These are just chores, but I could incorporate other habits if I wanted to. For now, let me think about chores, I can worry about habits later. 

Now to decide how many points pre chore. Let's just start with one point per chore, and then I can increase the points per chore if I fail to do them. I'm not going to worry about frequency, since ideally I would do this stuff daily I guess. 

| Chore    | Points |
| -------- | ------ |
| Litter   | 1      |
| Kitchen  | 1      |
| Bedroom  | 1      |
| Bathroom | 1      |
| Trash    | 1      | 

This means that if I did *every chore, every day,* I would end the week with a total of 25 points. This represents 100% completion, and this represents the maximum score. If I get 20 points, that represents 80% completion. That seems like a good threshold for reward. 

However, there's an issue here. What if I slack off on Monday and Tuesday, and realize that no matter how many chores I do later in the week, there's no way for me to meet the threshold. That would de-motivate me to work for nearly a whole week! Maybe there should be some remedial chores or household projects that I can do to make up for a bad few days, or to get extra points. That seems reasonable. I could even score these on an hourly basis: lets say I need 5 points to meet my threshold, I could work for an hour and "pay" myself 5 points an hour doing housework. That seems reasonable. 

But what should the reward be? Ideally, it's something that I'm not at risk of indulging in anyway, such as a cookie or something. It should be good enough to motivate a whole week worth of work, and ideally it shouldn't cost too much, since I *could* achieve this every week. Maybe I will reward myself by going to a coffee shop and relaxing on the weekend. That seems like a doable reward that I would genuinely look forward to each week.
