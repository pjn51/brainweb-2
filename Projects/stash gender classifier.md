# Stash Gender Classifier

# Introduction
As a short and easy project for Stashlogix, I'm going to set up a [[Python]] script that can take names as an input, and output predicted gender. 

# Timeline
## [[2021-12-13]]
I'm starting this today, and diverging from the overall [[stash-o-matic timeline]] because this is a branch off the main project. 

This should be relatively easy once I establish a working link between the Python instance running on the server and [[MongoDB]]. I'm going to try using [[PyMongo]] to do this. 

This project will be paused until I establish a protocol for linking the server with MongoDB.
