# Covid Tweet Investigation
---
Our fourth project as part of the [[Metis]] bootcamp is to perform some kind of [[unsupervised learning]] involving [[NLP]]. I performed [[topic modeling]] and [[sentiment analysis]] on tweets related to [[COVID-19]], and trying to fit a [[linear regression]] to predict case numbers based on the sentiment of tweets about a certain state's covid response.
