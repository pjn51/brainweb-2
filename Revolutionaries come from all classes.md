# Revolutionaries come from all classes. 
While [[The working class is the motor of society]] and therefore the only truly revolutionary class, revolutionaries will step forward from all classes - from [[lumpenproletariat|lumpen]] to [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] to [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]. 

For example, [[Engels]] came from a bourgeois background, [[Lenin]] was of petty bourgeois origin, and [[Huey P. Newton]] was lumpen in background.
