# Summary
A lot happened this year. It felt like an extension of 2020 in some ways, since the pandemic never seemed to quite end, and actually started getting worse later in the year. 

The winter and spring started out rough, with my worst flare yet starting in early January, culminating in my hospitalization for five days in February. Almost at the same time, I graduated from Metis and started looking for a job, a process which would take nearly six months. 

The summer was pretty hard as well, with lots of signs of burnout starting to show. There was a week of insanely hot weather, and our candles melted in our house! 

In the fall, things started to look up for me in a big way. We saw friends, went to my parents place for Thanksgiving, and of course: I got a job! I also went to the [[IMT]] national congress, which was a life-changing event that really affirmed by commitment to the organization. The fall was probably the best season for me this year.

Ending out the year, the winter brought snow on Christmas Day. I felt lonely and disconnected during the holidays, since I didn't really give any meaningful gifts, and I didn't recieve many gifts at all. 

Overall, this year got progressively better as time went on, which is a good thing I suppose. It bodes well about next year, although we all know that things rarely progress in a linear fashion, and [[Change is omnipresent]]. 

Next year, my big resolution is to make more friends, and start to cultivate a social network that isn't just Eylen and her friends.

# When have you felt proud of yourself in 2021? What were you doing?
I feel proud of myself for getting my diet together and solidly removing gluten and dairy from my diet. It's always been a challenge for me to control what I eat, and I'm proud that I've had very few slip-ups when it comes to getting rid of those ingredients, which hasn't always been an easy task. 

I also feel proud of the work I've put into the branch this year. It's taken a lot of patience and dedication, but the branch culture is pretty good. 

# If you had to teach one thing you learnt this year (that would improve one's quality of life) what would it be?
Continuing with the theme of personal health, I would teach that the *direction* your health is moving is far more important than where you are *right now.* For almost the whole of 2019 and 2020, I was slowly sliding downwards, but I ignored it because I was able to handle my symptoms and manage ok. That was a big mistake, and I should have gotten my shit together much earlier. 

However, I think some things have to be learned from experience, and it really took my hospitalization for me to change my mindset. So I'm not sure if I could really teach others the lessons that I've learned. 

# What kept you up at night with excitement this year? Was it worth it? Would you want to do more of it?
Finally getting my job. Yes, it was very much worth it, and I would love to continue having a job haha! This isn't exactly what the question is meant to be about, but this is what I was most excited by this year. 

# How did you have fun differently in 2021? 
Hmm, I guess I spent more time reading probably. I didn't really do any new fun activities this year, if anything I went biking less and didn't really replace it with anything. 

# How did you suffer differently in 2021?
Well, my flare was pretty horrible from Jan to Feb of 2021, so that would be that. 

# What people / kind of people did you spend less time with in 2021? 
We spent less time with our old friends from Bellingham for sure. Which was sad, but I'm looking forward to seeing Syd more often since they live closer now. 

# What people / kind of people did you spend more time with in 2021? 
I spent a little more time with my new Seattle friends, Jordan, Rae, Jeff, and Ari. Not much more time, but it's going in that direction which is exciting. 

# What did you feel guilty for in 2021?
I feel like I didn't prioritize forming solid relationships, and let that aspect of my life really suffer from lack of attention. 

# What three people are you the most grateful to in 2021 and why? How can you find more people like this in your life?
The people who come to mind are my Mom and Eylen. My Mom flew all the way out here to help out during my flare, and Eylen has always been there for me through everything. A third person honestly doesn't come to mind, which is sad. I want to really put more energy into reaching out to others more, in order to cultivate a network of people who I can rely on during hard times. 

# What have you learnt about the way you deal with uncertainty in 2021?
I definitely withdraw when faced with difficulty and uncertainty. I feel like if I retreat within my shell, I can minimize the pain and anguish of whatever I'm going through. Honestly, that seemed to work ok during the really bad times, but avoiding problems is a really bad way to solve them in the long term. 

# What new habits did you create in 2021? Which ones would you want to keep?
I really developed a habit of reading and thinking, which is both good and bad at times. It can be really powerful and enjoyable to think abstractly, but sometimes it does take away from the other aspects of my life. I want to cultivate more interpersonal habits in 2022. I also feel like I'm moving towards a better balance of keeping us healthy in terms of food. 

# Did you feel you spent enough time with your family / significant other in 2021? How would you change this in 2022?
I feel like I saw my family enough, and I was *physically* with [[Eylen]] enough this year, but I don't feel like I brought enough of my mental presence to our relationship this year. I should dedicate more effort to our relationship and making her feel special. I know if I dedicate my energy to this, I can improve things a lot. 

# What things did you stop caring about in 2021?
Hmm, nothing really comes to mind. I'll revisit this one. 

# What new things did you spend a lot of money on in 2021?
The big one was my bootcamp, but really the big ticket items were all bad things, like having to get our car repaired. I got a new laptop and phone, as well as new glasses. 

# What new thing did you spend a lot of time on in 2021?
I spent more time on the [[IMT]] than I did last year. I feel like the branch is really coming into its own, and could soon be developing a sustainable energy all its own. 

# What do you feel you've gotten a lot better at in 2021?
Political work, as well as caring for myself. For the former, I've put in countless hours reading, thinking, and explaining these concepts, and I feel more consolidated than ever before. 

In terms of my health, I feel like I've taken responsibility for my own care in a way that I should have done long ago. 

# When you felt at peace this year, what were you doing?
The time I felt most at peace this year was probably when 

# Which of last year's goals did you not achieve? Why did you not achieve them? Will you carry them on to 2022 and if not why?
I didn't really have any goals for this year, as far as I can remember. I probably wanted to work out, and I *sort of* did, I got a lot healthier in general at least. But seeing as I didn't have firm goals for 2021, I can't really carry them forward, can I?
