# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
This evening we're hanging out with Colin and Deb. I've never met Deb so I'm looking forward to it. We also have an apartment showing at noon. We've decided to broaden our search to one-bedroom apartments, since it seems impossible to find a two-bedroom anymore. If the choice is between renting a one-bedroom and owning a one-bedroom, the decision is obvious. 

I feel good about the work I've been doing on the Stash project in the last two days. [[JavaScript]] isn't so intimidating when you really get down into it.
