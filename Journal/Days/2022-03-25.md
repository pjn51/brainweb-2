# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is our first day back to reality after our trip. I have an infusion in the morning, followed by an in-person one-on-one with Josh. Later, I've been invited to hang out with Jacob. 

I got an email notifying me that there's a British comrade visiting Seattle in April, and he wants to attend branch or grab coffee or something. I'm really interested in meeting up with him. 

Josh expressed some desire to step back from his recent responsibilities. That sucks to hear, but I just have to figure out how to get some weight off his back. I think I can start rotating the reading group convening responsibility instead of having him do it every time, and maybe freeze his contact intake. Hopefully that will help. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
