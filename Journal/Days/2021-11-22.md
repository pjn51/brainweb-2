# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for being able to see my family. This is our first day in Boulder. My mom was talking last night about all her woes with getting people to help out with her fruit rescue group. They harvested over 90 apple trees this season, and they're trying to see apple butter but no volunteers want to help my mom out. So she has to do it all herself.
