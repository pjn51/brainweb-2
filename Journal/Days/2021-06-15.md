## Thoughts
Today is the first day that I test out my pomodoro goals of 3L, 2H, and 6C sessions. So far this seems really manageable. It's only 1pm and I've gotten 9 of the sessions done already.

I truly cannot fucking get [[spaCy]] to work on this computer. I've tried so many different ways and methods, but it always just says `zsh: illegal hardware instruction` because this Mac has the M1 chip in it. I think that over time these libraries will start to work with the new chip natively, but it's a serious pain in the ass right now. I can't get TensorFlow to work either, meaning that I can't really do any [[deep learning]] locally.

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
