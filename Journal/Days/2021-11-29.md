# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for routine and comfort. I'm also especially grateful for [[Eylen]] since she's going to be leaving from the 1st to the 10th. While she's gone I want to try to stay social, since that's something she does for me most of the time. 

I'm diving back into [[NLP]] in a big way, using my [[Obsidian]] notes as a dataset. It's a really interesting dataset for me, because it really represents my inner life. 

I tried to change the font in Obsidian, to no success. It seems like every solution that others use doesn't work for me. I created a snipped exactly like others' have done, but nothing changes when I activiate it. I'm in the mood to mess around with how this platform looks today. Not very productive but satisfying. 

Today I have an infusion, and I'm going to try and work from the hospital so that I don't have to work late. This will be the first time I really try and work from my laptop for any real amount of time. 

Look what I figured out! Since images now render in edit mode, I can put a pretty banner above all my daily notes. Isn't that cool?

Damn, the infusion today is taking forever. I started at 2 and it seems as if it's going to take 2.5 hours at least.
