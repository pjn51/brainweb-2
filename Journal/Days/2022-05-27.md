# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I'm expecting the offer letter from Indeed today. They said they would have it to my yesterday, but I'm trying not to worry too much - it's just a bureaucratic process of writing a contract, they've already made their decision. 

There was really low attendance at the reading group last night, so we're pushing the reading until next meeting. I sent a reminder that comrades should send apologies. I know I go pretty easy on people, and sometimes I need to counteract that tendency. It's not that hard to tell us you can't come to a meeting. 

I had a bit of a scare with the GitHub backup of my vault today. Some files got corrupted, so I think I'm going to store it in Google Drive instead. However, I don't think that Drive really functions as a *backup,* more as a sync method. So I have to look into that.
