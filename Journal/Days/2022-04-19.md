# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Last night we downloaded a new video game, Wolfenstein 2. So far, it's really fun. I was playing it in the morning, but I should really try and be productive at this time of day. I haven't coded anything in a while. 

Honestly, sometimes it seems that even though our branch is now 8 active members, there's still the same amount of work that the more experienced comrades are doing. I really need to try and change that - it's on the verge of burning out our cadres if we were to expand any further. That's going to be a difficult process of having very fresh comrades step up to take on organizational tasks. 

I downloaded an interesting new plugin. It's called[[ spaced repetition]], and it introduces a system for that process of information reinforcement into [[Obsidian]]. I'm using it for a slightly different purpose - reinforcing the connections between notes. It's pretty useful as a way to review old idea notes, attempting to form new connections between them. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
# ✏️ Today's edits
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.cday < this.file.day
WHERE file.mtime > this.file.day and file.mtime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.mtime
```
