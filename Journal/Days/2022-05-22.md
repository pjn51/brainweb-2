# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is the last day before by final interview for the [[Indeed Technical Analyst]]. I really have to grind today, and practice all aspects of what tomorrow will demand of me. I need to practice a bit of [[SQL]] and [[Python]] problems, and prepare for the situational interview with Syed. I also have two rounds with people from various teams that I'll be working with. I don't really know what to expect from those, or even what teams I'll be meeting with, since Syed never replied to my email asking for more details. 
 
Interview prep today
- [x] Review all Metis projects
	- [x] Project 2: [[natural amenity regression]]
	- [x] Project 3: [[fake job classifier]]
	- [x] Project 4: [[covid tweet investigation]]
	- [x] Project 5: [[wildfire classifier]]
- [x] Review stashlogix project
- [x] Go through common situational questions using the [[STAR method]]
- [x] Mock live-coding

I did a mock live-coding session with Eylen, and it really stressed me out. I couldn't even solve the "easy" challenge, although I felt better seeing that it was from Interview Query, where the "easy" problems have less than a 40% success rate.
