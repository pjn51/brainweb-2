# Thoughts
Today my mission is to clean the house up and to be social this evening. Calla is going to be in town and has been asking [[Eylen]] to get drinks. Eylen doesn't want to be alone, so I'm coming along I guess!

Today I'm grateful for the fact that I was able to find a parking spot not too far from home. We're actually going to go ahead and start spending $150 monthly to get a parking spot at our building. There's just no point in owning a car when taking it anywhere is a downright nightmare. 

Yesterday, we played a lot of Cuphead. I actually defeated three bosses in a single day: the theater woman, the ghost train, and the mermaid. That made me feel accomplished and skilled. 

In this moment, I feel pretty hopelessly incapable of finding a job. Maybe I'll just be unemployed forever, living off of Eylen and using the medicaid insurance. 

Also, I'm really bored. I feel a compulsion to buy a new video game, but nothing on Steam seems remotely interesting to me. I should probably stretch or meditate or something to get my mind off of things.
