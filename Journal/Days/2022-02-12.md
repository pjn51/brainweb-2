# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today I had a really productive branch meeting ([[2022-02-12 branch]]) where we decided on a day for our reading group, and I proposed a slate of officers for the next period of the work. I'm feeling pretty good about that. We're going to have our first reading group next Thursday at 6:30 PM. I gotta remember to put that on the calendar! This is a new step for the Seattle work. It wasn't so long ago that we started having weekly meetings, and now we're going to have a whole other avenue of the work!
