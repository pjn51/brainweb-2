# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today I kind of blew up. Eylen has been saying "Yatriiiiik" in a very high-pitched way that's really been annoying me. Anyway, she was doing that this morning, and I asked her why she could never just ask me politely to come and visit with her. Well, if there's one thing to really guarantee bad behavior from her, it's a question like that. Of course, it became a whole thing and it ended with her pressing a button that made a loud noise right next to my ear repeatedly, and me grabbing the button and throwing it across the room. 

In other news, this evening is our joint IMT branch, which is going to be nice. I wish it wasn't friday at 6pm though, so that we could have other plans. That reminds me, I need to actually prepare a little leadoff on the state of the work in Seattle. That shouldn't be too much work.
