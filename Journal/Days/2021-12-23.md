# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for the fact that my code worked well yesterday, haha. 

My top priority today is to do some work on the stash project before we go run some errands. We're getting a new desk to replace the one that [[Eylen]] is using, and we're going to Target to return a lamp and get some last-minute gifts.
