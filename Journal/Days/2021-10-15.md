# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to take care of [[Eylen]]. My passive nature tends to make me a sub-par caregiver, because she usually has to ask for help before I provide it. I should really be predicting her basic needs, and trying to meet them before she asks, because usually it's too late by then. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that she doesn't have [[COVID-19]], and that I actually got a job, which I will start on Monday. I'm heading to the Microsoft campus and meeting with Janet Slasor, who will walk me through getting set up on their computer for me, as well as some onboarding stuff. 

Looking at yesterday, I created a fuck ton of notes. I think that represents the fact that ideas were a big missing hole in my brainweb that's now being filled. That process ought to slow down somewhat, although I could still see myself creating a huge amount of notes very quickly.
