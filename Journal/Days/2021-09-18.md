# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to have a one-on-one with Jake, and probably go do a paper sale and perhaps go to the [[Socialist Alternative]] rally this evening. 

Today I'm grateful for...

Yesterday, [[Jacob]] and I hosted Jake Thorp. We walked around Cap Hill, the UW district and campus, and we visited the [[Lenin]] statue in Fremont. We had long discussions about the work, and it was nice to actually meet Jake in person. In the evening, Jacob and I went bowling for Ari & Jeff's combined birthday party. I ended up walking almost 18,000 steps!
