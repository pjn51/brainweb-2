# Thoughts
We're switching to a new format for the [[IMT]] locally. We're going to meet on the Branch Development Committee twice a month, and then we will have an in-person reading group at a coffee shop in Seattle somewhere. Since [[Jacob]] is stepping back, and we're trying to do a little bit too much, I think this is the best option. It makes me feel much better that the political content of our meetings will be put back in the center of the in-person activities. I'm #emotion/excited for the future.

I get off work at three, and Globe Optical closes at 5, so I should just head straight there when I get off work and get my contacts.
