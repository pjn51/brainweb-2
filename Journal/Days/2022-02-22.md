# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Last night it actually snowed a little bit. I'm jealous of my friends in LA while I have 30-degree days here. Anyway, I feel like coding some today, so I'm going to give my Dad a call and see where we can take the project from here. 

I decided to put [[IMT]] anniveraries for each comrade in my calendar. It will be a nice reminder of how far we've come, as individuals and as a branch. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
