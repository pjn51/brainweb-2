# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we're having the first mid-week tabling session. It's going to be nice not tabling after branch on Saturdays, so that I'll have more time with [[Eylen]] on our days off. 

I'm making a lot of progress on my mini-DS project. It's making me feel more confident, and more interested in pursuing [[data science]]. I feel like I have >80% of the skills needed to do full-time DS, so why am I trying to go in a different direction?

Well I called Apple Health to give them an income attestation, and they did kick me off. But there isn't going to be any penalty for me not reporting my income since October.
