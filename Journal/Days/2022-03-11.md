# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We submitted an offer for [[320 Melrose Ave]] last night, but now we're regretting it after we've seen the HOA minutes. Their building is very poorly ran, with many things being broken for long times without being fixed. For example, they had a leak in the lobby for 2 months (!) before it was fixed, and there is apparently no regular maintainance schedule, or even regular collection of dues or enforcement of any bylaws. However, our realtor Robert says it's fine! We decided to ask him his thoughts on the minutes as a way of gauging his honesty, and he failed big time. 

I started creating a personal website. You can find it at https://pjn51.github.io/! Since full-stack development is a possibility, it's a good idea to have a portfolio website. After playing around a bit with front-end dev stuff, I realize that I hate it way more than backend. There's no way I would want to be a fullstack dev. HTML is particularly infuriating to work with. In order to make a div flush with the window, I had to set the margin to negative 7 pixels. Like what the fuck is that about? There's nothing I've seen in [[JavaScript]] yet which is as stupid as that. 

I need to prep for branch tomorrow --> [[2022-03-12 branch]].
