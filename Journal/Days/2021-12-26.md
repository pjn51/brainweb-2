# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for the fact that it snowed on Christmas day. Very appropriate. 

My top priority today is to relax, but also to prepare for Syd's potluck that we're attending this afternoon. We need to think of what food to bring. 

# New note taking method
Yesterday I mentioned that I had developed a new method of taking notes from physical books. I realized that I've begun to dread reading books on which I've commited to taking extensive notes, such as [[The History of Philosophy (2021)]]. It just isn't fun to read a page and then write down everything that the page said. 

Instead, I've begun to use an index card as a bookmark, and when I come upon an idea that deserves a note, I'll make a tiny dot in the margin and write the page number on the index card. Then after I accumulate a good number of ideas, I can pause and begin creating notes from these ideas. 

I've been trying this out with [[Marx and Engels - Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy (1959)]], and it's going very well. It seems to be a good balance between flow and note-production. 

I'll call this system the [[dot method]] for short.
