# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I'm feeling pretty upbeat this morning. My new toothbrush should come today - I'm happy that I finally just went ahead and ordered it. 

I have to go through a list of minority disagreements to get my disagreement rate down. So far, I can clearly see that the majority are cases in which others said Not Compromised and I said something else, like Unclear or Suspicious. I should go a little easier on the grades apparently. 

I've confirmed the day of my next interview for the [[Listing - Indeed Technical Analyst]]. On Friday I'll be speaking with the hiring manager.
