# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
I found a really interesting site called [Elicit](https://elicit.org/) that provides a [[machine learning]] based approach to research and topic generation from the academic perspective. You can enter questions, and the algorithm will search 200 million research papers and attempt to answer. It has a few other tasks as well, such as brainstorming research questions, clarifying a concept by breaking it into components, defining terms, etc. 

Here's an example for brainstorming: when I enter "effects of capitalism on the environment," the algorithm returns more specific questions:

- How does per capita wealth affect the environment in nations?
- How would a transition to universal basic income impact environmental issues?
- How do developed countries pay for environmental costs?

Then, I can take the third question, and plug it into their "lit review" task. That returns the following ideas:

- Markets do not reflect the full social cost of production, resulting in incorrect measures of scarcity. That's an important idea! [[Markets tend to externalize social costs]].
