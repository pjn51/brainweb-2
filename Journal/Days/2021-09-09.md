# Thoughts
Today my mission is to get some shit done. Pretty standard. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that I live in the 21st century. If I lived long ago, I probably would have died because of [[Crohn's disease]] by now. That's a scary thought. 

Today I'm going to do physical therapy, and then I have a one-on-one with JT. I'm not working today, so I want to use that opportunity to get the house in order. Yesterday we cleaned the bedroom a lot, and today I want to get the rest of the house really tidy. It feels good to be in a clean and neat environment. 

I also attended [[2021-09-09 with JT]] today.  

# Notes from PT
I need to walk 30 min per day. I have some new exercises to do, like lying on my belly with 90 degree arms and flexing my chest backwards off the ground. Try 20 of those. It will improve posture and strengthen back. 

I should also do a leg extension and wall sits. Notes can be found on the paper that the doc gave me.
