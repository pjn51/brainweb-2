## Thoughts
Today I started reading [[Dune (1965)]]. This book is super thick and that excites me. I know that reading this book will be a journey that will take months to complete, and there are multiple other books in this series afterward! So far it's really interesting, and the world it's creating is captivating. A part of me wants to take notes on the world, but another part of me wants to just let the book wash over me without worrying about categorizing every piece of new information. I think I'll take notes on it, but only the thoughts that reading it makes me have, not any kind of exaustive summary or anything. 

The Dune movie is coming out on [[2021-10-01]], so if I want to read all 794 pages by then, I just have to read 9.8 pages per day on average. That seems *sort of* doable. We will see.
