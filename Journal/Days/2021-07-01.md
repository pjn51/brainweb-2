## Pomodoros
```
LEARN    ---> 2
HUNT     ---> 5
CREATE   ---> 2
```

## Thoughts
I really need to focus more on the actual job hunt. Maybe I should raise my goal from 2 pomo to 3. Not that I'm reaching that 2 pomo goal generally. Today I did though! I'm listing Stashlogix as [[career]] experience now that I have enough things to talk about in a future interview. I have to go pick up my contacts today after work, and the optical place closes at 5.
