# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for the snowy weather. I really like looking out the window and seeing it all white and calm. I'll take this cold and snowy weather over the warmer but rainy and grey one. 

My top priorities today are to deliver a package to the post office, and to clean the house before our guests arrive this evening. 

Today was the first day of information processing under my new system of note-taking. I realize that I haven't fully elaborated this system. I'll call it the [[dot method]]. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
