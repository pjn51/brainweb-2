# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today's the day we send the earnest money. I reached out to Renee, our [[escrow]] agent, and she is going to ask Matt to send over the contract so she can set up an account for the earnest money to go into. Then we can wire it, hopefully by mid-day today. 

Attempts to wire it have run into issues. First, I don't know my debit pin, since I never use the card. That prevented me from doing an online wire, so I tried to do it over the phone. For some reason they can't see my checking account, so they have to "call the back office" to see how they can access it. If they can't, I just have to go in-person to the bank, which would be fine. This seems like a lot of complexity for one of the basic operations of a bank...

The BofA rep I was talking to can be reached at 904-273-3801 and francesca.deem@ml.com
