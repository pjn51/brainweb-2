# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to set [[Eylen]] up for success - she got food poisoning and isn't feeling so well. 

Today I'm grateful for my comrades still. I'm starting to have a bit of what JP called "post-partum depression" as I return to my normal life after the Congress. It felt like I discovered a whole family of people there, and I wish they were here with me still. However, I still feel super energized to build in [[Seattle]]. 

Today Eylen started to feel really bad, she threw up and developed a fever and chills. We're really hoping that it's just food poisoning or something, but we're getting tested for [[COVID-19]] tomorrow morning. I went ahead and asked my comrades to move branch online tomorrow, since I won't have the results by the time we were going to meet. 

# Questions for realtor
We're going to an apartment showing today and I want to ask a few questions.

1. Any possibility for negotiating the price?
2. Negotiating HOA fees?
3. Reputation of the investor? I know it was a flipped property
