# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today I had a one-on-one with Jake, which was nice. It's just nice to talk to somebody who's so dedicated to the work. He's like a role model for me, honestly. I feel like he's one of the few people who understand what it means to choose to prioritize organizing in your life. 

# One-on-one with JT
- Set up one-on-one between Jacob and Chris
- Maybe the Transitional Program would be better for Freeman
- Read through Three Letters to Dobbs
