# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Fuck, I was just messing around and lost a week's worth of notes. God damn it. Well, that's what I get for not backing up my vault. I guess that's one downside of [[Obsidian]], no automatic backups. 

# 📝 Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
# ✏️ Today's edits
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.cday < this.file.day
WHERE file.mtime > this.file.day and file.mtime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.mtime
```
