# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today is a lazy Sunday. I'm going to go pick up crutches for Eylen so that she doesn't have to walk so much. I love her so much, especially when she reads my secret notes 🤪

I started writing a choose-your-own-adventure in Obsidian. I figure it's way easier to do it in here, rather than in Python. I'm not sure why I didn't think of this sooner honestly. 

I got the results from my infusion-related blood tests back, and I have an elevated ALT liver enzyme. That's probaly from all the [[ketamine]] that I did over the course of our trip. I should tone it down a little bit probably. 

# ✏️ Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
