# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We went to the Lights concert last night which was fun. We even got the setlist! It wasn't the kind of music I would usually go see, but it was fun. The fans were mainly younger than us which made me feel old. 

I just got off the [[2022-04-05 WRC]] call, and I feel pretty inspired to bring consolidation and contact work to the next level. We really need to professionalize the consolidation system that we use in the branch. As of right now, I'm really the only one conducting consolidation meetings with newer comrades. That needs to change.
