## Thoughts
Today I have [[2021-07-07 with Jen Raimone]]. I thought that we were doing branch today, but I got the date wrong and we're actually doing it on Saturday. I've been feeling very unproductive this whole week so far, and that's reflected in my pomodoros. Not so great. By this time last week I had done 15 pomodoros, and this week I've done only five. 

I feel like I'm in a haze today. I don't have the attention span to focus on anything, even video games. However, in the evening, I feel a lot better. Not sure what the deal was today, but I set up a new tasks plugin in [[Obsidian]]. Now I can keep track of tasks a little more effectively, and I can see all overdue tasks in each daily note. 

I think I will also start tagging tasks based on which project they're a part of, so that I can also compile tasks for certain areas, such as political work, project work, or life tasks. 

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
