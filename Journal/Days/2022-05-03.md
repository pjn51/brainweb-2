# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
[[Eylen]] and I have finally gotten [[COVID-19]]. She tested positive this morning, and we both have sore throats. I can't belive that after two years and one month of the pandemic, we finally got it. 

I'm regretting that I didn't ever get a fourth booster which I'm entitled to. 

There was a bit of an issue figuring out what we will talk about for branch this weekend, but in the end Jacob agreed to give his leadoff that he was planning to do before he bailed.
