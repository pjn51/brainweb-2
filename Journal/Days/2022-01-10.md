# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Last night I was reading some more of [[Atomic Habits (2018)]] and it inspired me to attach a time to a few of my habits. I want to work out for 13 minutes (convinent for my work) right at 10 AM, and then I'll meditate right after. The book was saying that having a specific time for a habit can make it more doable. I also want to attach these habits together to take advantage of a technique called *habit stacking,* which the book mentions. We're more likely to do a new habit if it's attached to an existing one. 

Today I have to go get a [[COVID-19]] test in preparation for my colonoscopy. I'm a bit worried for it, since I was hearing that many people are testing positive *after* being in the hospital, due to staff testing positive but being forced to work due to staffing shortages. I'm hoping that's not the case here in Seattle. The only place I've heard of that happening is NYC. Regardless, I don't really have a choice, and it isn't like I'm going to be in there for more than a few hours anyway. If I got through a week in the hospital, a few hours should be ok, right?
