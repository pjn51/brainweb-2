# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today [[Eylen]] and I were talking about our different writing styles. I noticed that she tends to express more emotion and personality in her writing, which I envy. I feel like I'm missing out on something, like there's a part of my emotional side that is either missing or buried somewhere. I would really like to do some digging and find that side, because I think it would shake me out of my tendency towards passivity and avoidance. I want to really feel alive instead of having some kind of intellectual distance between me and the world. 

# One-on-one with Freeman

- [[Philosophy]] as a bulwark against [[socialism|socialist]] ideas
- Modern philosophy's disconnection with reality
- Theory as a map to action
- [[Lenin]]'s use of propaganda in the right context (writing WITBD at the right time)
- Relationship of philosophical ideas and the [[proletariat|workers]]' movement
	- "Errors in theory lead to errors in practice"
	- [[dialectical materialism]] explains that things can and do change, and helps us understand how they change 
-  [[Materialism]] versus [[idealism]]
	- Examples of idealism: [[religion]], beliefs in the un-revolutionary nature of American culture, the [[state]] as idea rather than physical force
- Lenin's respect for theoretical questions and philosophy
