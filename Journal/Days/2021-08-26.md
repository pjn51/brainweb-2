# Thoughts
Today my mission is to prepare for Evan coming over.

Today I'm grateful for...

Im debating if YAML frontmatter blocks are worth putting at the top of each note. I can have custom attributes, but without a concrete benefit that I can think of, putting a new format at the top of hundreds of notes is a lot of work. This app already supports a few, suck as `ctime`, `tags`, etc. The one huge benefit would be the use of aliases, where I can make multiple terms lead to one note. That seems incredibly useful for some terms that I tend to use the restrictive alternate label formatting for. 

I am a size 7 for ring / rings. 

# Todoist
```todoist
{
"name": "Tasks for today",
"filter": "today | overdue"
}
```

# Today's notes
```dataview
LIST 
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
```
