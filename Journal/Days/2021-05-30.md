## Thoughts
This morning I'm tabling, but only Kylee can make it. To be honest I'm a little #emotion/nervous tabling without [[Jacob]] because he really adds to the excitement and the energy. This will be good for me though, good experience. 

Just got back from tabling, it was a positive experience I guess but some old people yelled at us about how [[socialism]] meant that we "wanted to harvest people's organs like in [[China]]." That #emotion/annoyed me. We also had weird interactions with two other socialist groups, the [[FSP]] and [[Socialist Alternative]]. The FSP lady asked why we didn't just join FSP, and the SAlt people set up their table right next to us which was weird for everyone I think. 

We sold 5 papers and made three contacts though so that was still good. This is the hard and slow work of building an organization.
