# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to get some shopping done and host JT. This evening, I'll be going to Ari & Jeff's combined birthday party at a bowling alley or something. 

Today I'm grateful for our parking spot! Minus ten stress points whenever using the car. 

I'm wondering what we should do with Jake today. I don't really have anything planned besides talking about the work, but I think we should go on a little BLM walking tour of Cal Anderson. I drove by the East Precinct and they're taking all the metal fencing off of the outside today. Interesting timing. I wouldn't be surprised if things flare up within the next 12 months, making this decision a bad choice. I guess it reflects their confidence due to the fact that there haven't been any BLM protests in the last few months.
