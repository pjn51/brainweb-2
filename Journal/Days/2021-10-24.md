# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to hang out with Daniel while [[Eylen]] is at an all-day ceramics class. 

Today I'm grateful for my ability to read theory by great thinkers like [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]]. Many communists in the past would be hard pressed to get access to works that I can easily get for free instantly. 

Daniel came down from Bellingham to hang out today. We went to Chinatown to have some Dim-sum at a place that featured a "fried meat football" that Daniel wanted to try. We ate in a park and then took the bus to see the Lenin statue in Fremont. From there, we walked the path around Lake Union past Gasworks and back to UW, where we took the LINK home. It was nice to see him and get an update on what his life is like in Bellingham and how things are going.
