# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Back to work. I have a one-on-one with Jake, and then I'm going on a drug run. I also need to hammer out some disagreements from last week that I never got around to discussing. I played with Mimi for fifteen minutes today very intentionally and it made me realize how little we play with her in an average day. She's just the best cat ever. She puts up with anything with little complaint. 

# One-on-one with Jake
- Poliana - absence due to unsupportive husband
- Josh - feeling burnt out, stepping back from press duties
	- He recommends explaining that leadership isn't about having answers, it's about stepping up and getting the work done and doing your best
- Hayden - new member, beginning one-on-ones with her
- Travis - hopefully meeting him at our reading group Thurs
- General engagement - how to cultivate? 
- Reading - [[What is Money? (2016)]]
	- What point is Booth making about the credit / debt theory of money? -- it's one half of the truth, but has limitations if you reject the role of money as commodity
	- The idea of [[primitive communism]] isn't universally accepted.
