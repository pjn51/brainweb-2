# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to ace my [[2021-10-01 Atos interview]]! I'm really excited about this position, and I think I have a good shot. I'll be bummed if I don't get an offer. 

Today I'm grateful for the fact that my work will end with time left for me to prepare for my interview. I've been calling out of work for one reason or another every week, and I'm glad that I can avoid doing that. I need them to still like me for a little while, until I get another role!

UPDATE: I feel like the interview went well. I answered every question the right way *I think* and the only thing that would really stop me would be if some others with more experience applied. Even then, I feel like I have a competitive application. They said that they thought that the job might be a little bit boring for me, but I tried to emphasize that I really want a job with a very defined role that I can perform. 

# I GOT THE JOB!!!!!!
161 days, 117 applications, 41 formal rejections, 5 interviews, and one offer. I'm going to be working for Atos and getting paid $67K annually, with health, vision, and dental benefits.
