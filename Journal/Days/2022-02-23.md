# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
After [[Aikido]] yesterday I'm very sore. It threw off my whole morning since I didn't want to get out of bed! It's a sunny day today but very chilly. My plan is to do my laundry, and then have a mid-day break at a coffee shop before returning to work in the evening. I should also get some coding done, but I'm not feeling very inspired to go on to the next few tasks. They all involve learning [[JavaScript]] and [[JQuery]], which I don't really want to do. I know that I should, and it will be good for my resume, but I actually want to build something rather than just learn about some new syntax. Oh well, I should just get it over with. 

I started watching a crash course video series on JQuery, and now I'm taking a mid-day break at Rapport, which has become a good option for going someplace near my apartment.
