# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
This morning we're going to see a townhouse, and then a maintainance guy is coming to fix the seals around our windows. 

Jacob called me today to let me know that he wants to step down to sympathizer status. I think that's the right call, and we should have done that a year ago, but better late than never. It's a more accurate reflection of his real role in branch. He hasn't been active for almost two years at this point frankly. 

As I've been working on the next draft of my article, my blows on [[Socialist Alternative]] have softened somewhat. It's hard to pin their errors down, since on paper they're the exact same organization as the [[IMT]]. I haven't found a perspective that they seriously differ from us on, the difference is in the internal mood and methods of the organization, and the fact that their methods *don't* align with their perspectives.
