## Thoughts
Today I have [[2021-07-21 with Dr. Zisman]]. Not much to talk about, which is a good thing! Today I'm going to try and do half of the things I need to do, to ease my way out of this slump. 

I ended up doing nothing, but I feel like I finally recovered today. [[Eylen]] made a great dinner and even did half the dishes. That made me feel much better. I had a lot of time to just be bored, which I think is essential for curing [[burnout]]. 

## Today's notes
```dataview
LIST

WHERE file.ctime > this.file.day and file.ctime < (this.file.day + dur(1 day))
SORT file.ctime
