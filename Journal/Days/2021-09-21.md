# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to see my nutritionist, and get ready for my Atos interview. 

Today I'm grateful for [[Obsidian]] organizing my thoughts. I can easily pull up doctors notes and medication names on the fly, which makes it really easy to stay on top of things. 

Today I have [[2021-09-21 with Dr. Judson]]. 

I've been thinking about how to design the hardest maze possible. I was initially thinking of it in terms of the highest number of incorrect decisions that you can make, but I should maybe think of each decision based on how likely the player is to make it. If the wrong decision is obvious, then the player will make the right one. People usually judge maze decisions by looking a little bit ahead and seeing if the path closes off. So should I make the highest number of medium-long pathways possible, with only one being the correct route?
