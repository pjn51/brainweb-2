# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I'm meeting up with Killian at Discovery Park. I hope it will be fun, and if nothing else, we will be going somewhere I've been meaning to go forever. I think we'll have lots to talk about. At the least I can ask him lots of questions about what Switzerland is like, and what it's like to be a welder working on ships. 

Today has been a weird one so far. I think it's the grey weather. The first thought I had this morning was "Every day is the same, they're all bleeding together." It's weird that I was thinking that way, since I have many things happening this week to look forward to.
