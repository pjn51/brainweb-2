# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
We're still in a bit of a haze from getting the townhome, but now we've entered the planning stage. There will be a one-month overlap between getting posession of the home and our current lease ending, so we have plenty of time to move in. There are some projects that we want to get done right away, mainly converting the carpet to a vinyl plank floor in the bedrooms. Other stuff can wait until we're fully moved in. 

We have to send the earnest money by Tuesday at 5pm, and we also have to apply for a loan by Friday! Lots to do. I'm about to see my net worth plummet by 82% lmao. 

# Call with BofA representative
- Fees
	- $40 fee for domestic wire transfer
	- Is there a possibility of waiving fees? If so, will they waive fees for my case?
- Speed
	- Same day: have to make sure it's a wire transfer, not ACH. No additional fees. 
	- We need the money to arrive by Tuesday at 5pm. 
- Through my computer, bofa.com, transfer / zelle, send to outside institution, input correct info, determine speed **must be wire transfer, not ACH**
