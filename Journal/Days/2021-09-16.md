# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to prepare for JT's arrival and think of some things we could do. He will be staying at [[Jacob]]'s apartment Friday and Saturday nights, and then we are all going up to Bellingham to have a joint meeting up there. He wanted to see what Cap Hill is like, and there's a [[Socialist Alternative]] rally on Saturday that I thought we could attend, so Jake could get an idea of the numbers that SAlt was actually pulling in [[Seattle]]. Other than that, I'm looking forward to just talking about politics and organizing. 

Today I'm grateful for the chair that I'm using today. [[Eylen]] says that her designer chair is hurting her back, so I'm getting it today. It's great for my back! I feel like I'm sitting up perfectly straight all day when I'm sitting in it. 

I went to the dentist in the morning to get an impression for a nightguard. I'm glad that I've gotten around to doing that, because my teeth are really feeling the impact of grinding. The infusion center never called me back, so I have to call them today, *again.* Insurance sucks, and I hate it. 

Colton --> Louisa's (Metis student I taught) husband's roomate in College, now works at Convoy. This is a *tenuous* connection at best lol. But I'll take whatever I can get!
