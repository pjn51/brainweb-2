# Thoughts
Today my mission is to care for [[Eylen]]. She needs some support right now. I should go to the grocery store and make a good meal for her today. 

Today I'm grateful for the season. I've been looking forward to fall for months and it's finally here! 

We went to Jake and Bean's apartment this evening, and Jake proposed to Bean! We were playing pictionary, and Jake was drawing and we were all guessing. Finally, Bean guesses "Proposal!" and Jake stands up and walks over to her and gets down on one knee and proposes! We were all freaking out since we had no idea that was about to happen. He recorded it via a camera across the room, so he captured the audio of us all screaming once we realized what was happening. 

In less exciting news, Sam's boyfriend Patrick introduced us to Flint's Mints, which are really cool.
