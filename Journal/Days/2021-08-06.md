# Thoughts
I feel much better today than yesterday. [[Eylen]] and I are going thrifting and then I have a one on one with Tom in the afternoon. I always enjoy talking with him, even though we're discussing the most depressing book ever, [[Germany From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (2006)]]. I just love Tom's enthusiasm! 

I'm also hopeful about finding some new clothes today.
