# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today I got a lot done. 

1. Read for my [[2022-06-03 OoO with Hayden]]
2. Work on interview prep
	1. Rewrite [[SQL]] note for clarity, atomize it. 
3. Pick up chickpeas from the Buy Nothing post
4. Prepare my leadoff for [[2022-05-21 branch]]

We tried to go to Rapport, only to find that they've permanently stopped functioning as a coffee shop, and are transitioning to a brunch / dinner place. We were both quite annoyed at that, and headed to Top Pot instead. I wish they had decided to become a full-time coffee place instead, but I knew they would make a decision eventually. It was really weird that they tried to be a wine bar, cafe, and a resturant at the same time. Not a vibe.
