# 💭 Thoughts
Today I'm grateful for friendly Mimi, a peaceful morning, and [[Eylen]]'s coming return home. 

I want to learn more about teaching. [[How can I effectively teach others?]]

Lets do an inventory of what I'm reading with others right now. 
1. Reading through [[What is to be Done (1902)]] with John
2. Reading through [[Russia - From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (1997)]] with Josh
3. Reading through [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]] with Jake
4. Preparing a leadoff on [[Fascism What It Is and How To Fight It (1944)]] 

Pretty neat! Being in the [[IMT]] means that you don't have to have any willpower to become more consolidated, you just have to agree to do this kind of thing with others. It echoes how we should [[Prefer systems to goals]].
