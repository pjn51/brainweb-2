# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we're meeting with another realtor to see if he would be a good replacement, hopefully more trustworthy than Robert Street. 

We completed reading the Manifesto in reading group last evening, which was satisfying. Next up we're reading *State and Rev.* so that should also be really fun. I haven't read that in a while.
