# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
%%What did you do today, and how did it make you feel?%%
Today I feel pretty tired. Not sure why. I have a contact meeting with some person who reached out via Twitter, so that's interesting I guess. I still need to reach out to some data engineers, I don't know why I'm putting that off. Oh, also, we're submitting another offer on a house today. I really don't think we're going to get it, but if we did, that would be great. The place is really nice, and it's a great location. It's the type of place that I could see us living in for many many years. 

I called Grandmom today to ask if she could pitch in for a loan. She said she would have to crunch some numbers but could at least do a couple thousand. I don't really think that will make much of a difference honestly. Anything under $10k is small beans in the world of real estate around here unfortunately, which is an absurd thing to wrap your head around.
