## Thoughts
Today we went and fed Maddie's cat, went to an interesting yard sale hosted by a Bosnian couple, one of whom is an architect and the other is a graphic designer. They had lots of interesting books about both topics. Later in the day, Christine came to visit and we walked to Pike Place Market. It was a nice relaxing Sunday with not much stress. 

I started taking notes on the [[Python Data Science Handbook (2016)]] which is a comprehensive guide to DS that will increase the density of my [[Obsidian]] DS cloud (and also I will learn which is the real focus of course). 

## Today's notes
