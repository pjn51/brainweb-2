# 💭 Thoughts and feelings
Today we're having a workday at Rapport. We're going to a hockey game tonight, which ought to be fun. I took a lot of notes and read my next portion of [[Russia - From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (1997)]], which was *really* depressing. It was the section on how [[Stalin]] killed so many [[Bolsheviks]], including basically all of [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]]'s family.
