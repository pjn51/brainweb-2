# 💭 Thoughts
Today my mission is to start my [[Atos]] training and get us back on track in the cooking department. We've really been struggling to eat well this week, and it's really because I've been distracted. If I don't set us up for success, nobody will.

Today I'm grateful for [[Eylen]] getting me an air fryer! It's an early anniversary / birthday gift. We made fries last night and they were pretty good. It's really fast too. I want to have fried mushrooms, that sounds really tasty. 

So far, this Atos job is going to be really easy, but not *insanely* easy. I'm still going to have to be at my computer for around 8 hours in the day. I basically have to grade 50 to 60 sessions daily, but I could ramp up to that slowly. I can still have online meetings (with some interruption) and I can read and write and take notes and work on other projects during the workday. 

Today (so far) I've done 14 grades in around 30 minutes. That means my rate is something like 28 grades per hour, or just over 2 min per grade. If this pace is representative, that means that in an average workday, in order to do 50 sessions, it would take an hour and 40 minutes of work.
