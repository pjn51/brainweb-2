> ⭐️ - I did well during the interview process for the [[Indeed Technical Analyst]]. I'm really excited for this role!
> 💣 - This week it was really challenging to cook and take care of myself. 
> 	
> This week was really all about those interviews, and other than that it was a haze. I didn't do a good job taking care of food, and I went to bed hungry a few days in a row. As the week ends, I'm hoping to turn that around, since it just isn't the way to live.

> [!three] 
> This week, we ate dinner with Eylen's mom to celebrate late Mothers' Day. I spent the whole week studying SQL in preparation for my technical interview early the next week. I had a chat with Dr. Zisman about basically nothing, since I'm feeling good. I had an infusion on Friday, and I spent the weekend at branch and cramming SQL prep. It was a bit of a stressful week as I prepared for my interview. However, I didn't have to cook that much since Eylen's mom prepared some great food for us.
