# Summary
This was a really great month! From start to end, a lot of good things happened to us. First off, I got my job of course! That was an excellent start to the month, and would singlehandedly make it a great month. We also saw friends multiple times, and I attended the National Congress, which was honestly a life-changing event for me. 

This is the kind of month that counteracts the negative events of the last year, and paints the whole season in a positive light. I'm hoping that the rest of autumn and the rest of the year will be just as good, although I know that eventually we all have to come down from highs, and this month was certainly a high point.

Eylen and I spent a day with Jeff and Ari, after unsuccessfully going shooting (the spot had been closed). I had a one-on-one with Josh. I picked up my nightguard from the dentist.

# Third week
I attended the second day of the National Congress of Socialist Revolution, and returned home. [[Eylen]] came down with some illness, and we got tested for [[COVID-19]] (we were negative). I had a branch meeting online to prevent the spread of my potential infection. I began including ideas in my brainweb.

# Fourth week
We went to see four apartment listings. I had my first day at Atos, which was a shitshow with setting up my workstation and getting situated. Eylen got me an air fryer. We went to see a few apartments. I had a branch meeting and went tabling near UW.
