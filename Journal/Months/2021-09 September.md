# Summary
I would say that this was a relatively good month. I didn't feel that overwhelmed. We saw our friends, did fun activities most weekends, and I got some great political work done. As the weather gets worse and worse as we head into October, I hope that I can keep the positive vibe going and overcome some signs of burnout returning.

# First week
This week, I had a lot of medical appointments, and some political activity. We went to Jake and Bean's house, and he proposed to Bean! We went to the first day of Day In Day Out and saw KAYTRANADA as well as some other artists. I attended branch and went tabling on the UW campus.

# Second week
We attended the second day of Day In Day Out. Christine came over on Monday, which was my Dad's birthday. I went to the Metabolic Bone Disease Clinic for some physical therapy. I had a one-on-one with Jake Thorp. This week contained the (likely) last 80-degree-day of the year. We went to some really bad stand-up comedy and got drinks with McKee and her partner Maggie. I played Magic with [[Jacob]] and some of his friends.

# Fourth week
I attended the aggregate IMT meeting in Bellingham. I saw my nutritionist, and had a second-round interview at Atos. This was the first week of fall. I made a cool "red wedge" sticker for my computer.
