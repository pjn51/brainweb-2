# Credit destabilizes the global economy. 
Because [[Global debt has surpassed GDP]], lenders and debtors are tied in a complex network of obligations. This system works fine as long as the lenders are confident that debtors will continue making interest payments, but as soon as a single debtor country defaults, global lenders will begin withdrawing their investments, all trying to avoid being the last person "holding the bag." This means that investment [[capital]] dries up quickly, stalling the economy.

This is an additonal way that [[Global supply chains are fragile]] on the investment side.
