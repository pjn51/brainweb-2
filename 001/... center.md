# The center of my vault 🌐
---
This is the center of my vault. It is a place to begin lines of inquiry and dive into the ideas and questions that I've collected here. 

My questions are generally divided into two categories: questions which look outward and seek to understand the world, and questions that look inward, seeking to understand myself. 

I look outward and ask, 
# [[How can one understand the world?]]

I look inward and ask 
# [[How can I live a good life?]]
as well as 
# [[What's next for my career?]]
