# Style guide üìù

---
This is where you can find general information about my [[Obsidian]] vault. Fundamentally, my vault is organized as a web of topics, meetings, literature notes, and other thoughts. I created this vault in November 2020.

# The evolution of my software stack
Initially, I had a separate daily journal where I kept my thoughts and tasks, but I integrated my daily journaling habit into Obsidian in May 2021. I continued to use Google Calendar for recurring events and as the final word in my task management system, but some tasks began to live inside Obsidian. 

In July 2021, I commited to task management in Obsidian, since I was using the program so much more than Google Calendar. I continued to plan events using the latter tool. 

In August 2021, I switched over to Todoist for task management. It's ok for me to just let tasks be tasks and knowledge be knowledge. Obsidian isn't really designed for task management. 

# Hubs
I've developed a method of giving my vault some bones to build on without being restrictive at all. Topics that serve as organizing pages are called hubs in this system. This table lists all the current hubs in the web. I want to be as flexible as possible when it comes to this system. I eventually moved on from this system but the notes still exist. 
```dataview
LIST FROM (#hub)
WHERE file.name != "001 - start"
WHERE file.name != "hub template"
SORT file.name
```

# Citations
In my literature notes, I tend to cite following the style (p.1). If the literature note is expected to have multiple sources (for instance, if I'm taking notes from a collection of essays such as *Marxist Classics v.1*) then I will follow the format (Ibid, p.1). 

In my idea notes, I either follow the above format or another one, such as [1].

[1]: Ibid, p.1

# General conventions
[[Note friction should be minimized]]. [[Build scaffolding, not cages]]. In general, I tend to follow the guidelines of the [[evergreen notes]] system, with a lot of influence from [[How To Take Smart Notes (2017)]]. 

# Tagging conventions
Notes are tagged by type, especially when the type is too broad for me to use a direct link.

I no longer use Obsidian for tasks, but I have tags for my past tasks. 

# Linking conventions
At first, I tried to create a *hierarchical* linking policy, but now I feel that's too restrictive, and focuses too much on creating a clean, pretty graph. With so many notes, the graph is actually holding me back instead of playing a progressive role. 

With that in mind, I've decided to switch to a *dense* linking policy. I think that wherever I mention a concept, I should link to the note on that concept, regardless of the aesthetics of my graph view. However, I avoid linking to things artificially. If the word doesn't appear in writing, it doesn't deserve a link.

I can still use the hub system with this linking policy to dive into my brainweb from this page. 

# Literature notes
When I'm taking notes on what others have said, I should make it clear that these are not my own thoughts. I can do this by structuring my writing to indicate that I'm relaying the arguments or the explanations of an author. For example, I should say, "The author said XYZ is true," rather than just parroting "XYZ is true."

# File names
I prefer to use 'natural' capitalization (don't capitalize things that wouldn't be capitalized in a sentence) and I prefer not to include "the" in front of organizations (I wouldn't say 'the United States,' just '[[USA|United States]]').

# Folder conventions
Folders are organized by type rather than topic.

# Formatting conventions
In some notes, I use H2 headers for every division, with a decimal system indicating which sections are swithin other sections. In other notes, I just use H1 headers with H2 headers within, and so on. Some notes have a combination of these systems. 

# Graph conventions
I use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/272b34-ba2d0b-d5f2e3-73ba9b-fab2ea-6c8ead) to generate a color palette. 

# Idea notes
For idea notes, I want to include *my own ideas* rather than the ideas of other thinkers. I prefer to have each note title be a standalone sentence that acts as the distillation of the idea. Within the idea note, I have a backlinks section so that I can see where the idea is referenced or origninated. 

I prefer tagging to categorization, and I have a variety of idea tags that represent the topics discussed. More information can be found in my [[thought cabinet workflow]]. 

# Question notes
Question notes act as natural organizers of ideas. When questions are linked in ideas, they should be on their own line as a H1.
