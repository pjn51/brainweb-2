# Introduction
The Democratic Party is a through-and-through capitalist party. Organizations like the [[CPUSA]] and the [[DSA]] support voting for Democrats or running candidates on its ballot line, but the [[IMT]] does not. 

# Structure of the Democratic Party
The Democratic Party is not really a traditional political party like you would see in other countries. The actual party apparatus lies dormant between elections, with most branches of the organization only existing to manage volunteers for canvassing and phone banking for candidates. The real decisions aren't made by the rank-and-file party members, but by a clique of careerists and their hired consultants at the top, inside organizations like the DNCC (Democratic National Coordinating Committee) and DSCC (Democratic Senate Coordinating Committee). These two bodies control the funding of House and Senate races respectively. 

# Function of the Democratic Party
Unlike other political parties, the Democrats have a total stranglehold on [[state]], in coalition with the Republicans of course. They control redistricting between races, and they and the Republicans have been able to play off one another to prevent any outside challenges for a long time. 

The structure of the Party makes it clear that the real function of the Party is to act as a vetting organization for the funds of the ruling class. By approving candidates for ballot-line access, they also approve them for funding from Democratic sources, including rich donors. Candidates also gain access to media coverage that will paint them in a positive light.
