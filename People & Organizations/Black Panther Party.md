# The Black Panther Party 
`LINKS:` [[the black power movement]]

---
This #org was founded in 1966 by [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]], college students in Oakland. 

Their organization was involved in a lot of [[mutual aid]], education, and organization of the Black community throughout the [[USA|United States]], in the [[UK]], and in Algeria. 

At their peak in 1970, the BPP had 68 offices throughout the country, and thousands of members. However, [[media]] was able to villify them, and they started to become isolated. 

In their isolation, and due to the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] program, the BPP began to degrade. Some chapters were accused of criminal activity by the local community, and by '72, most activity was in and around Oakland. 

# BPP Ideology
At first, they were largely a black nationalist organization. They began to be affected more and more by the ideas of Marxism, and specifically maoism. Newton goes over this in depth in [[Intercommunalism (1974)]].
