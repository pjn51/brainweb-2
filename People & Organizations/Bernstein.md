# Introduction
Eudard Bernstein was a notable thinker of the [[SPD]] in [[Germany]]. He was associated closely with [[Marx]] and [[Engels]], but began to criticize their ideas and moved towards a position of revisionism. 

Bernstein was a founding member of the [[USPD]] in 1917, the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. However, Bernstein rejoined the SPD in 1919 during the events of the failed revolution. 

# Ideas
Bernstein believed that the ownership of [[capital]] was becoming more and more diffuse, as opposed to the Marxist prediction of the centralization of capital. Based on this idea, he opposed revolution and favored a slow, graudal building of the [[reformism|social democratic]] movement since he belived that [[capitalism]] could adjust and escape the cycle of crisis.
