# Introduction
This is the company that I work for as a Security Consultant. 
# [[How can I detect compromise?]]

There are various notes that are important to keep track of, such as my [[Atos health insurance options]]. 

# 401(k)
Atos will match *half* of my [[401(k)]] contribution, up to 6% of my paycheck. That's the level that I've enrolled at. 

# FSA
[[A FSA allows you to use pre-tax income for healthcare expenses]]. I'm currently paying $500 into my FSA annually, as of Nov 2021. 

# Sites
- [MyAtos](https://wac.das.myatos.net/sso_auth/authenticate) is where I go to submit time sheets, look at my info, etc. 
- This [Portal](https://prod.uhrs.playmsn.com/uhrs/?ReturnUrl=%2fmarketplace%2ftasks%2f) is where I actually login to work. 
- [MyADP](https://online.adp.com/signin/v1/?APPID=RDBX&productId=80e309c3-70c6-bae1-e053-3505430b5495&returnURL=https://my.adp.com/&callingAppId=RDBX&TARGET=-SM-https://my.adp.com/static/redbox/) contains my payroll info. 
- [Blue Cross Blue Shield](https://www.bcbs.com) provides my health insurance. 

# Insurance
www.bcbstx/member.com is where I can see my health info such as group no, etc. If I need help with that, I can call `800-521-2227` and tell them that my group number is `276 693`. 

If I want to change my health insurance selections, I can go to https://atosmybenefits.hroffice.com/#/navigate/home which is the Atos benefits center. Not much information about my plan here though. 

# Overall healthcare costs
I have a variety of [[Atos health insurance options]] and [[Atos dental and vision options]]. 

If I pursue the silver plans across the three fields, my costs are broken down here:

```
$4461.16		annual medical cost
$150.28			annual dental premium
$67.60			annual vision premium

$4679.04		estimated annual cost
```
