# Introduction
The French Communist Party (PCF) is a political party based in [[France]]. They played a negative role in the events of May 1968, choosing governmental favors over genuine proletarian revolution. After those events, they lost credibility in the eyes of the French workers, and steadily lost influence, arriving where they are today.
