# Introduction
Martov was one of the leading figures on the left-wing of [[Mensheviks]]. He sometimes appeared to be moving towards [[Bolsheviks]], but tended to waver at the decisive moment. 

After the Russian Civil War (see [[Russia]]), Martov went to [[Germany]], where he died of natural causes in 1923.
