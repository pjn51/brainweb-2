# IMT branch tracker: [[IMT branches]]

The IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency, is a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]] organization, with sections in 50+ countries. Global membership stands at over 4,400 as of Jan 2022. 

The [[USA|American]] section of the IMT is called Socialist Revolution, and has 450 members in 30+ cities (as of June 2022). The IMT supports building a [[workers' party]], and [[The IMT considers itself a tendency rather than a party]]. See the [[Positions of the IMT]] on various issues. When I joined the IMT in March 2020, there were ~220 members. 

[[The IMT emerged from a split in Militant]] in 1991, and its first US comrade (JP) joined around 2000. 

As for the SEA branch, [[How can I nurture the branch?]]
