# Life


# Ideas
[[Engels]] said that Saint-Simon's coming of age during and after the French revolution informed his ideas about the main antagonism of society being between [[proletariat|workers]] and idlers. 

Engels credited Saint-Simon for saying that the French revolution was a three-sided class war between the nobility, the [[bourgeoisie]], and the propertyless class, and even starting the conversation on the abolition of the [[state]].
