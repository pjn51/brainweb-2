# Karl Kautsky

Kautsky was a prominent theorist of the Second International as a member of the German [[reformism|Social Democratic]] party, the [[SPD]]. He went from being one of the most respected Marxist scholars to what [[Lenin]] called a 'renegade' later in his life, because of his support for [[Germany]] in [[WW1]] and efforts to blunt the edge of Marx's ideas on revolution. He became a leading figure of the current of [[reformism]] and [[opportunism]] in the Social Democratic movement.

> Kautsky loftily sweeps aside [[Marx]]'s views on terror... at that time, do you see, Marx was still very 'young' and consequently his views had not yet had time to arrive at that condition of complete enfeeblement which is so clearly to be observed in the case of certain theoreticians in the seventh decade of their life.
