# Introduction
The CWI was an international association of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] political parties that existed from 1974 until 2019 when there was a split.

# History
It was established by a group of Trotskyists that were kicked out of the [[Fourth International]] in 1965. It was primarily made up of members of [[Militant]] in the [[UK]], as well as other revolutionaries from 12 countries. 

They pursued a strategy of [[entryism]], but this ended in the early 90s with the Militant's "open turn."

In 2019, there was a multifaceted split over the issues of [[identity politics]], the role of the [[unions]], and the international program. This led to two organizations claiming the legacy of the CWI, the "In Defense of a Working Class and Trotskyist CWI" faction, and the "CWI Majority" faction. The former faction claimed that the CWI was dead and that they were refounding it, while the second claimed that the CWI still existed and the former faction was just splitting from it.
