# Introduction
The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) is a left-wing organization in [[Mexico]], specifically the Chiapas region near the border with [[Guatemala]]. They take their name from the movement led by [[Emiliano Zapata]]. 

They are an organization based in the [[peasantry]] that claims to be at war with the Mexican government, although the conflict isn't very active. 

The EZLN has been described as [[socialism|socialist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] but rejects any definite ideological classification.
