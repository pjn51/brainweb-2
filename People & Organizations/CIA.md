At its core, the CIA is the most direct agent of [[USA|American]] [[state]] intervention. The CIA is sent in when the interests of the ruling class are threatened directly and no sugarcoating of the situation can be done by the press. When a third-world leader tries to raise local living standards or disrupts the flow of global [[capital]], it's the CIA who are tasked with destabilizing their government or supporting their rivals.
