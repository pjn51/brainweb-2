# Quotes
> “...with my vote, I want to support the reformists in the same way as the rope supports a hanged man- that the impending establishment of a government of the [[reformism|reformists]] will prove that I am right, will bring the masses over to my side, and will hasten the political death of the reformists, just as was the case with their kindred spirits in Russia and Germany.”
