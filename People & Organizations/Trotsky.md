# Life
Leon Trotsky was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainain]] revolutionary who fought side-by-side with [[Lenin]] in [[Russia|the October revolution]]. He later led the creation of the Red Army and the defense of the USSR during their civil war. 

When the [[Bolsheviks]] split with the [[Mensheviks]], Trotsky initially held out for a reunification of the two parties, refusing to join the Bolsheviks outright. However, when he saw that the Bolsheviks were the truly revolutionary of the two, he joined and was a big part of their success.

Even before Lenin and other Bolsheviks, he believed that workers in Russia could advance towards the creation of a socialist project, although such a project would be impossible to complete without revolution in the more developed capitalist states. 

After the victory of [[Stalin]] and the bureaucracy he represented, Trotsky was exiled from the USSR, and eventually killed by a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] assassin in [[Mexico]]. 

His legacy inspired many others who carry the banner of [[Trotskyism]] today. 

# Ideas
Trotsky explains his theory of [[permanent revolution]] in [[Results and Prospects (1905)]] and [[The Permanent Revolution (1931)]]. 

Trotsky believed that the USSR under Stalin represented a "degenerated [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]." He expands on his theory, as well as his position on support of the USSR, in [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]] and [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]].

Trotsky expands on his idea of the relationship between the leaders and the workers in [[The Class, the Party, and the Leadership (1940)]]. This represents some of his best work in my opinion. 

# Quotes
>Naturally, the “condition of class forces” supplies the foundation for all other political factors; but just as the foundation of a building does not reduce the importance of walls, windows, doors, roofs, so the “condition of classes” does not invalidate the importance of parties, their strategy, their leadership.
>-- [[The Class, the Party, and the Leadership (1940)]]

> The dialectic is not a magic master key for all questions. It does not replace concrete scientific analysis. But it directs this analysis along the correct road, securing it against sterile wanderings in the desert of subjectivism and scholasticism.
