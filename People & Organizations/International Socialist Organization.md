# The International Socialist Organization ðŸš©

The International Socialist Organization, or ISO, was a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] group active between 1976 and 2016 in the [[USA|United States]]. It emerged from a split in the [[International Socialists (US)]] over leadership style, and was founded as a section of the [[International Socialist Tendency]], but was expelled from that group in 2001.  

The group entered a decline througout the 2010s, and entered a crisis in 2019 after it was uncovered that the leaders of the ISO had covered up a rape committed by one of the leading members in 2013. After a third of the membership resigned immediately, the ISO voted to dissolve itself, with many members joining [[DSA]] instead.
