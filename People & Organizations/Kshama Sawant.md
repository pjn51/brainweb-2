Sawant sits on the [[Seattle]] city council, and is a member of [[Socialist Alternative]]. She was elected in 2013 by a 1.7% margin, and was re-elected in 2015 by a 12% margin. In 2019, she was again re-elected with a 4.1% margin, despite her opponent recieving more than $1.5 million in corporate backing. 

During the [[June 2020 uprising]], Sawant led protestors into Seattle City Hall, and participated in a march to Mayor Durkan's home. These actions led to a recall election in 2021, but Sawant survived with a margin of only 310 votes, or 0.76% of the total ballots cast. 

Hey, thanks so much for the invite! Unfortunately, crohns disease doesn't make it easy for me to travel to Vegas. Hope to see you all soon though!
