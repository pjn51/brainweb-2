Kornilov was a military commander in [[Russia]]. He led the failed Kornilov Affair under the [[Kerensky]] Provisional Government, but this failed and he was arrested.

In November 1917, he escaped prison and became a leader of the White Army. He led soldiers across eastern Russia, saying that he wouldn't stop in the pursuit of his goals, even if he needed to "set fire to half the country and shed the blood of three-quarters of all Russians."

He was killed by a Red Army shell in April 1918, as his forces were laying seige to a city near the Black Sea.
