# Plekhanov
`TAGS:` #people 

---
Plekhanov was a [[Russia|Russian]] revolutionary, and a contemporary of [[Lenin]]. They often butted heads, but also frequently worked together. 

He was originally a member of [[Narodniks]], but started studying Marxist theory in exile. He realized the errors of Narodnik strategies, and tried to move the org in a more proletarian direction, but eventually split from them and went in more of a Marxist direction.

Later, Plekhanov was a member of [[Bolsheviks]], but eventually moved over to [[Mensheviks]] and was a major thorn in Lenin's side. He supported the defense of Russia in [[WW1]], further removing him from the Bolshevik position. 

By the end of his life, he was an isolated far-right social chauvinist.
