--- 
Socialist Alternative is a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] political group in the [[USA|United States]] and elsewhere. 

They are relatively numerous in [[Seattle]], with a few hundered members. One member of the Seattle City Council is a member of SA, [[Kshama Sawant]]. 

SA was formed as Labor Militant by members of the [[CWI]] that had moved to the [[USA]] in the 80s. They changed their name to Socialist Alternative in the late 90s.

After the CWI split of 2019, Socialist Alternative affiliated to International Socialist Alternative (ISA).
