Trump was the President of the [[USA]] from 2016-2020. He was often accused of being a specter of [[fascism]], although he must not have been a very good one, seeing as he was removed from office without much real resistance. The fact is, he was just an egotistical asshole. 

His success lay in the fact that he knew how to seem different from the standard political ghoul, while not actually isolating himself from those in the ruling class he needed to win support from. He was able to skillfully channel the anger of the masses at "the swamp," despite the fact that he had no intention of draining it, and was in fact an inhabitant.
