# Line

# Introduction
The attributes of a line have many factors. Lines can be thin or thick, and textured / non-textured. 

Dry ink pens can provide a thicker and textured look, while fountain ink styles can give a smoother look. 

# Texture in Linework
For a line with more texture, pencil styles are best, or maybe a textured art brush. To add texture, we can add a new layer above the base linework so that we can edit it without editing the lines in general. 

Try to combine different brushes to give your art more variation and make it interesting. 

# Stippling
This adds a retro look and a bit of an 'unpolished' vibe. If you want it to be a little more vintage, add a little ink bleed or stippling where the lines meet.
