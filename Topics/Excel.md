## Introduction
Excel is a tool offered by Microsoft that allows us to create tables, organize data, and perform some data analysis. It is common in the business world, but its powers are exceeded by tools like [[Python]]. However, it is important to be fluent in Excel since many business-sector people only know Excel, and if we want to collaborate with them, we have to use a shared language. 

## History
Excel was first released in 1987. It is a very old software that has been updated a ton. 

## PivotTable
A pivot table is a table of grouped values that aggregate the individual items of a more extensive table. This may include sums, averages, or other statistics. In Excel, this functionality is available via the PivotTable functionality. 

## Charts
Of course, Excel supports various plots and histograms. It also supports PivotCharts, which are charts linked directly to a PivotTable. 

## Size limitations
As of version 16, Excel can handle a little over one million rows and 16,000 columns. This makes it ideal for smaller datasets. 

## Conclusion
Excel is a tool that is useful for communication with less technical people, but it isn't really that useful for large-scale [[data wrangling]] or [[data science]] in general.
