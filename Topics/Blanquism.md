# Introduction
Blanquism describes a conception of socialist revolution through a takeover of the [[state]] by a small group of secretive revolutionaries. In Blanqui's mind, this group would seize the state apparatus and use it to overthrow [[capitalism]] through a temporary dictatorship by the revolutionaries. Then after a new state of affairs had been established, this clique would turn power over to the people. 

Blanquism was often used as an insult by [[reformism|Social Democrats]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards [[Lenin]] and his conception of revolution. Lenin denied that he was a Blanquist. 

> To speak of civil war before people have come to realise the need for it is undoubtedly to lapse into Blanquism.” - Lenin (LCW, The 7th (April) All-Russia Conference of the RSDLP(B), vol. 24, p. 236)

> Blanqui is essentially a political revolutionist. He is a socialist only through sentiment, through his sympathy with the sufferings of the people, but he has neither a socialist theory nor any definite practical suggestions for social remedies. In his political activity he was mainly a "man of action", believing that a small and well organized minority, who would attempt a political stroke of force at the opportune moment, could carry the mass of the people with them by a few successes at the start and thus make a victorious revolution.
