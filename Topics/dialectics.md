# Dialectics

# Fundamental laws
The dialectic method is to view things in motion rather than their static form at the moment of analysis. A chair is not only a chair, it is in process of being used and being used up simultaneously. You cannot fully understand anything apart from its context and without knowing the place it is heading.

[[Engels breaks down the laws of dialectics into three principles]]. I've rephrased these using my own words. 

1. [[Quantity transforms into quality]]
2. [[Opposites require each other]]
3. [[Action causes reaction]]

# Contradiction
One key idea is that [[Everything contains contradictions]], and that [[Things change through contradiction]]. 

In order to analyze things dialectically, we have to look at the internal contradictions within that thing, see which direction each contradiction is moving, and see what factors are causing each side of the contradiction to strengthen or weaken. Then, we can try and determine at which point in the quantitative strengthening or weaking of each side of the contradiction a qualitative shift will occur. 

> [!Example]
For example, if we are studying the motion of a ball through the air, we see that the ball is being slowed by the air, but being pushed forward by the force put into it by the thrower. We can see that friction is causing the momentum of the ball to slow, while the air resistance is unchanging. Therefore, we can determine that the direction of the ball will one day change qualitatively (it wll be headed downward, rather than forward), and we can keep our eye out for the moment that the quantitative decrease in momentum will result in this qualitative shift.

For a more complex example, we can analyze the class struggle dialectically. As [[unions]] move into action, the anger of the workers may push the unions to strike, while the corrupt leadership may push the unions to remain inactive. If we see that the material forces behind the workers' anger are growing in strength, we can deduce that eventually the workers will replace their leadership and strike. 

# History
[[Marx inverted Hegel's dialectic]]. 

# Applications
Dialectics, combined with the idea of [[materialism]], forms the basis of Marxist philosophy, [[dialectical materialism]]. [[The dialectic is a weapon]] in the hands of the [[Marxism|Marxists]] and the [[proletariat]] generally that can be used to plot a revolutionary course forward.
