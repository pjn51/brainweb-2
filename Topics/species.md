# Introduction
A species is a term used in [[biology]] and [[environmental science]] to describe a group of organisms that can reproduce together to create fertile offspring. Species can also be described as groups that share some degree of similarity in their [[DNA]], morphology, behavior, or ecological niche. 

The total number of species on Earth is estimated to be between 8 and 8.7 million, however only 14% have been described as of 2011.
