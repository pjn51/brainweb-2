# China's 1949 revolution
---
In 1949, the [[CPC|Communist Party of China]] came to power, backed by an army of [[China|Chinese]] [[peasantry|peasants]]. 

Upon taking power, [[Mao set up a deformed workers' state]] from the outset, since there was never any workers' democracy, and thus no authentic [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]].
