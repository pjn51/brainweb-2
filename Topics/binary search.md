## Introduction
Binary search is a search algorithm. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. It begins with an interval covering the whole array, and then compares the search key to the value in the middle of the search interval. If the middle value is too low, then we remove the bottom half of the search interval, and vice versa.

This algorithm assumes that the array is sorted, which is a whole field of computer science. [[How can we sort efficiently?]]

[[Binary search has logarithmic time complexity]]. 

and is able to use this information to get down to [[complexity]] of $O(\log{n})$. [[Big O notation relates input size to run time]].
