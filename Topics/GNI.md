# Introduction
[[GNI measures economic output owned by a country's citizens]]. Gross national income, or GNI (formerly known as GNP), is a measure of the total domestic and foreign economic output claimed by residents of a specific country, regardless of where the production takes place. 

# GNI vs GDP
[[GDP]] measures the value of the products and services produced in a given area, regardless of the national origin of the firm producing the products. For example, firms owned by shareholders in the [[USA]] which produce goods in [[China]] count towards Chinese GDP. 

On the other hand, [[GNI]] measures the value of the products and services produced by the citizens of a given country, regardless of where these products are produced.
