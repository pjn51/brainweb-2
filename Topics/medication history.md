# Introduction 
I have taken various [[drugs]] to treat my [[Crohn's disease]]. 

## Mesalamine
I took this medication very inconsistently for multiple years. It's unclear if it played any role in reducing inflammation.

## Prednisone
I was prescribed [[prednisone]] (40mg daily) after my April 2020 ER visit. I sucessfully tapered off of it, and took my last dose on 6-17-20. 

I resumed taking prednisone after my February 2021 hospitalization, and sucessfully tapered off of it, with my last dose on 3-24-21. 

## Entyvio
I've been taking [[entyvio]] every eight weeks from July 2020 to February 2021
I stopped taking infusions in February 2021 as my symptoms came back hard.

## Entocort
Started taking 9 mg on 1-7-21.
Tapered to 6 mg on 2-4-21. 
Stopped taking after my Feb 2021 hospitalization since they obviously weren't working. 

## Remicade
My first [[remicade]] infusion was on 2-17-21. I am scheduled to receive infusions every eight weeks (current as of May 2021). 

## Azathioprine
I took my first [[azathioprine]] dose sometime shortly after 2-17-21.
