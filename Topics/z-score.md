$$z = \frac{x – μ}{σ}$$

- x = observation
- μ = population mean
- σ = [[standard deviation]]

A z-score, also called the standard score, gives us an idea about how far from the mean a specific observation is. Technically, it's a measure of how many [[standard deviation]]s from the mean an observation is.

A z-score is a way to compare results in a normally distributed (see [[normal distribution]])  population.
