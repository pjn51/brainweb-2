# Natural Language Processing ðŸ’¬
---
Natural language processing (NLP) is the [[modeling]] task to extract features from text. This process is also called [[tokenization]]. These features can be used to model patterns in the content, [[topic modeling|topic]], or [[sentiment analysis|sentiment]] of text documents. 

For example, we can try and predict what topic a tweet is about, and recommend hashtags. Or we could try and predict what word will come next in a sentence, and create an autocomplete feature.
