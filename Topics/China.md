# China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³
---
China is a large Asian country which is governed by the [[CPC]]. They're a nominally [[Stalinism|Marxist-Leninist]] party, but have deviated greatly from even the line of the degenerated Communist Party of the [[Russia|USSR]]. Today, unfortunately, [[China is a capitalist country]]. 

The ideology of [[Maoism]] both influenced and was influenced by the course of the Chinese revolution. [[Maoism was a product of proletarian defeat]]. 

# The 1927 revolution
[[China's 1927 revolution]] was a failure, partially due to [[Collaborationism doomed China's 1927 revolution|the mis-leadership of the CPC and Comintern]]. 
[[Mao]] says that the decision to ally with the KMT was due to the conditions of the time. Mao said that the contradiction between [[imperialism]] and China's bourgeois had intensified to the point that the national bourgeoisie was a revolutionary class. To me, this seems short sighted, and the decision to ally with them is one thing, it's quite another to allow them to stab you in the back in a move that you should have seen coming. 

# The 1949 revolution
During [[China's 1949 revolution]], [[The CPC led the peasants to victory in 1949|The CPC led the peasants to victory]]. 
Later during [[WW2]] and the [[Japan|Japanese]] invasion, the CPC continued this pattern, and was only brought to power on the backs of the peasantry.

[[Mao set up a deformed workers' state]]. 
Initially, the CPC wanted to involve the bourgeoisie in agriculture, but the capitalist class was too undeveloped after the revolution, and were too afraid of the instability of the revolution to be progressive. Because of this, the CPC was forced to proceed on a path of collctivization of agriculture.
