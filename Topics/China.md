China has a complex history of revolutionary movements. For a book on this subject, see [[China - From Permanent Revolution to Counter-Revolution (2016)]]. 

The ideology of [[Maoism]] both influenced and was influenced by the course of the Chinese revolution. 

# The 1927 revolution
The Chinese Communist Party mishandled the situation and choose to back the [[Kuomintang]] and itâ€™s class collaborationist ideas. This gave Chiang Kai-Shek an opportunity to massacre Communists and workers in 1927, ending the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary organization of the working class. 

[[Mao]] says that the decision to ally with the KMT was due to the conditions of the time. Mao said that the contradiction between [[imperialism]] and China's bourgeois had intensified to the point that the national bourgeoisie was a revolutionary class. To me, this seems short sighted, and the decision to ally with them is one thing, it's quite another to allow them to stab you in the back in a move that you should have seen coming. 

# The 1949 revolution
Later during [[WW2]] and the [[Japan|Japanese]] invasion, the CCP continued this pattern, and was only brought to power on the backs of the peasantry.

The [[CPC]] was forced to adapt its theory on the role of the [[peasantry]] as a revolutionary class, since all the advanced workers were basically dead after 1927. This meant that there was no real basis for a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], and the CCP had to play the role of organizing bureaucracy. 

Initially, the CCP wanted to involve the bourgeoisie in agriculture, but the capitalist class was too undeveloped after the revolution, and were too afraid of the instability of the revolution to be progressive. Because of this, the CCP was forced to proceed on a path of collctivization of agriculture.
