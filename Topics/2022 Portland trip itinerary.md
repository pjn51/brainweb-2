# Ideas
- Nature / scenic
	- Portland Japanese Garden is around $20
	- Mt. Tabor (good views)... maybe do this as we leave on Thurs?
	- Pittock mansion (good views, near house)
- Westside
	- Coffee / breakfast: Fehrenbacher Hof (right next to our streetcar stop!)
	- Drinks: The Driftwood Room (midcentury modern lounge and bar, near house)
	- Activity: Powells books
- Eastside
	- Drinks: The Coffin Club
	- Food: Katchka
- Strip club recommendations ([source](https://www.heremagazine.com/articles/best-portland-strip-clubs))
	- Lucky devil lounge (eastside): “It’s a smaller, more intimate club with an outside covered patio and fireplace, large food menu, talented dancers, and a wide array of music from the obscure to Top 40.”
	- Kit Kat Club (westside): "hourly themed performances, very strong drinks."
	- Mary's Club (westside): woman-owned, oldest in the city. Divey vibe

# Monday
We will be driving for 3 hours to get there, so we probably can't do so much. We should have dinner someplace cool though. Check in is at 4 PM. If we leave at 11, we will arrive around 2pm and we could get lunch before heading to the Airbnb. 

# Tuesday
Relax day? We could go hiking, go to the Japanese Garden (~$20), or see the views from Pittock Mansion (unknown $).

# Wednesday
Going into the city for [[Eylen]]'s birthday!

# Thursday
Back into the city on our last day. It takes three hours to get home. So we probably have to leave by 3 or 4 PM. Check out is at 11 AM.
