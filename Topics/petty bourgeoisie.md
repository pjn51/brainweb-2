# Introduction
According to the economic theory of [[Marxism]], the petty bourgeoisie is the group of middle layers between the [[proletariat]] and the [[bourgeoisie]]. They use their own [[labor]], but supplement it with the labor of others. 

# Revolutionary potential?
It is a mistake to paint all the layers of the petty bourgeoise with one brush. They are a very heterogenous group, ranging from the owner of a hotdog stand to the owner of a chain of car dealerships.

The petty bourgeoisie has *some* revolutionary potential. A wide layer of their class stands on the precipice of disaster at all times, and therefore they can be quite sensitive to worsening conditions. However, they have a lot more investment in the system than the working class does, so their outlook will be more vacillating and unreliable than that of the workers. 

It is the revolutionary potential of the petty bourgeoisie that fuels [[fascism]]. However, the petty bourgeoisie can also play a positive role, since during periods of revolutionary upswing the PB layers tend to just go with the flow. 

# The modern petite bourgeoisie
The petty bourgeoisie are *much* less powerful in the 'developed' countries than they used to be. They used to be a huge power base that the state could rely on, but as [[capitalism]] has trended towards monopoly (see [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]]) the petty bourgeoisie has shrunken and become even more unsteady. Therefore, they can't really play an active social role anymore, at least in the [[USA]] and Europe. 

In other countries such as [[India]], there is still a large and powerful class of petty bourgeois [[peasantry]] and small merchants.
