# Selection Sort
When sorting [[data]] using this method, we have one pointer at the start of the list, and another pointer moving across. When the second pointer finds the next minimum element, we swap.

This method has a [[complexity]] of $O(n^2)$ since we have to proceed across the whole list for each list element.
