Sectarianism is an error in which [[Marxism]] becomes dogmatic, and the sectarian loses all flexibility in their understanding of the movement and their principles. 

On the deepest level, sectarianism represents the shell of Marxism without its' soul, [[dialectical materialism]]. The sectarian may adhere to what appear to be Marxist positions, but they have lost the ability to utilize the *method* of Marxism, and therefore are intellectual zombies, not really alive in a political sense. They live off the legacy of thinkers whose stances only made sense in a specific context long forgotten by the sectarian.
