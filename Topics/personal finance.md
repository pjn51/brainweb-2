## TA income
I got paid $30 / hour as a TA before taxes, and $25.52 after taxes. If I work two days a week, that means my monthly net pay will be around $1,429 per month. That amounts to a net income of around $17,000 annually. However, I can probably get a few hours from the asynchronous material, so my takehome will be higher than $1,400 monthly. 

If I work three days a week, my income would be $2,143 per month, which projects to $25,724 annually. That's my plan for the next few months, until my hours likely get cut in September. 

## Atos income
My total compensation is $2,577 per pay period, and my take home is $1,845 every two weeks. This amounts to $23.07 after tax per hour, and $32.22 gross hourly wage.
