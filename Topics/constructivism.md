Constructivist [[architecture]] emerged in [[Russia|the USSR]] during the 1920s. Its projects are characterized by modern (for the time) technology and engineering, combined with an ethos of [[socialism]]. 

Throughout the short lifespan of this current, there was a sharp contradiction between the economic needs of the country and the grand vision that the October Revolution had brought. Architects wanted to use the built environment to engineer social change. [[Constructivism was an expression of revolutionary inspiration]].
