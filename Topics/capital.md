# ðŸ’° Capital
---
Capital is accumulated [[labor]], created for the purpose of applying [[labor]] to it to produce more capital. 'Capital' is also used to refer to the capitalist class sometimes, since it is really the needs of capital itself that the capitalists end up prioritizing. Because the needs of capital represent "dead" labor, Marxists sometimes say that [[Under capitalism, past dominates present]]. 

Marxists attempt to study the processes related to capital. First and foremost, [[Capital tends towards concentration]]. This results in inequality and ultimately [[imperialism]]. This economic process is why Marxists say that [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]].
