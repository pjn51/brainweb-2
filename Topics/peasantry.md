# The Peasantry
---
The peasantry are a historical class of society that lives off agricultural work. In early [[capitalism]], they composed the majority of the population, but there are hardly any in the [[USA]] or Europe that we would consider peasants today. 

Many revolutionaries tried unsucessfully to lead the peasantry in revolution, including [[Narodniks]]. Unfortunately, [[The peasantry struggles to self-organize]]. Evidence for this can be seen in the numerous peasant revolts against [[feudalism]] that were ultimately unable to challenge the balance of class society. 

However, In [[China]], [[Mao]] was able to successfully lead the peasantry to revolution, overthrowing the semi-feudal Chinese state during [[WW2]] amidst the [[Japan|Japanese]] invasion. This is a part of the reason why the peasantry is a central topic in [[Maoism]]. 

[[Bourgeois revolutions rely on the peasantry]] to provide a mass character.
