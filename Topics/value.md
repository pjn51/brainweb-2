## Introduction
Value is a tricky thing to describe outright. 

## Value in Marxist economics
According to the economic theories of [[Marxism]], there are different kinds of value when it comes to [[commodities]]. We can differentiate between *use-value,* the quality of being useful or providing some value to the user of the item, and *exchange value,* having the quality of being valuable in terms of exchange with other commodities. 

Another important concept here is [[surplus value]], and the broader concept of the [[labor theory of value]].
