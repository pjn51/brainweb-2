This is the #hub for Marxist political theory. This is quite a broad topic, so I should be specific in what should link to this note. This hub is for Marxist *political theory*, not famous Marxists or organizations.

## Related Ideologies
The topic of ideology is complicated. [[Maoism]], [[Trotskyism]], and [[Stalinism]] claim to be the authentic torchbearers for Marxism. Even though I believe [[Trotskyism]] is the only authentic descendant, I'm classifying all three as their own thing to be a little more unbiased.
