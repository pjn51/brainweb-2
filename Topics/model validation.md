# Model Validation
---
When we're [[modeling]], we must ensure that this model is working well. This can be done through various [[metrics]], but we also have to ensure the model is *generalizing* well, that it is able to handle new data upon which it hasn't been trained. This is essential, because [[Predictive models must generalize to be useful]]. 

This process is called *validation*. If we want to go a step farther, we can perform [[cross validation]].
