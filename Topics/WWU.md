# Introduction
I attended WWU from 2016 to 2020. Because of my time there, I have a bachelor's degree in [[environmental science]] and a minor in political science. 

# My courses
## MATH 114
This class sucked. Just like every WWU math class. It wasn't even taught by a professor, just a grad student. And we had to manually calculate our grades because they couldn't bother to set up a page online! Totally disrespectful. I ended up getting a C. 

## SOC 269
The racism class. I wanted to see how "woke" college really was. Turns out not that radical. This class was interesting enough. There were probably over 150 students, our classroom was like a movie theater. My notes can be found in my Google Drive. I sat next to a Black girl, which was fitting since it was one of the only classes in which I saw Black people. I got an A. 

## PLSC 291
Introduction to comparative politics. The professor was cool. He studied the cartel in Central America. I was in a group with Sage who was fun to hang out with, but I would never really become friends with her. There was a Trump kid in the class who started multiple arguments. He wore a Trump shirt the day after the election, which was a bold move! I got an A. 

## ENG 101 			<-- start of winter 2016/17
English 101. This class was another joke. Nothing to write about this class. I made a podcast using one of [[Eylen]]'s songs for intro music. 

## ESCI 101
My first [[environmental science]] class! I thought it was super cool because I didn't know shit about the environment. The professor was awesome. My notes can be found in [[Obsidian]] now as the basis for the ESCI topic. Out of the 200+ students, I was in the top five and didn't have to take the final exam. I told the professor he inspired me to go into the field, and he remarked that he was sorry since I wouldn't make any money. I got an A. 

## PHIL 112
Introduction to moral [[philosophy]]. This was the only philosophy class I took, and [[ethics]] are the only philosophy that is interesting to me besides [[Marxism]]. The professor seemed cool at the time but looking back, he was trying really hard to seem cool. I got an A. 

## CHEM 121 		<-- start of spring 2017
This was my first chemistry class. I was better at chemistry than I expected, and it made me question if I could accomplish the chemistry needed for an ESCI degree. The professor *insisted* that we call her "professor," making me think she had issues with respect in the past. I got an A-. 

## ENVS 202
This class was about sustainability. This class was sort of a joke and made me rethink doing an ENVS degree. I learned about fish! I got an A-. 

## PLSC 271
International relations. This class was cool. I met Sam Zilly in this class, although we didn't talk much. We learned about theories of "the international community," which included a warped introduction to Marxism. I got an A-. 

## CHEM 122 		<-- start of fall 2017
This is the second general chemistry course. I don't remember anything about this one, except for that our professor was a Patriots fan and she cried once when she got a phone call that her toddler had hit his or her head at daycare. She was really nice, I would go on to have another class with her on purpose. 

## ECON 206
Introduction to micro-economics. I wondered if this class would make me move to the right, but all it made me think was that we already have the tools needed to plan the economy. I would later see the professor who taught this course at a protest at City Hall. I got an A. 

## LBRL 273
This class was on Chinese and Japanese art. It was taught by an older white guy which was funny. It was also at 8 in the morning, so it was deadly hard to pay attention. I wrote an essay about the famous [[Zen]] rock garden that I actually visited, Ryoanji. I got a B+. 

## CHEM 123			<-- start of winter 2017/18
This was the last general chemistry course. This was taught by the same professor as CHEM 122. My memories blur between those two classes. I got a B.

## MATH 115
This was precalculus II. All math classes at WWU sucked. They almost *want* you to fail out. Not me though, I got a B-. 

## PHIL 107
Introduction to critical thinking. I wish the professor applied some critical thinking, maybe he wouldn't have taught such a useless class about such a useful skill. We spent the whole time encoding arguments into an esoteric framework that I've never seen used anywhere else. I got a B. 

## BIOL 204			<-- start of spring 2018
This was the first course in the general [[biology]] series. This was the most interesting biology class I took. It was all about evolution, taught by a wacky old guy who went on expeditions all over the place. I should have done research with him. I got a B+. 

## GEOL 211
Introduction to geology. Cool in theory, but I hated how rocks all look the same but are actually different. I absolutley bombed the rock classification test, but overall I got a B. 

## MATH 124
Calculus. The first math class that was actually taught by a real professor. Daniel Groneberg was in this class with me. It was noisy, hot, and cramped in the classroom. I got a C+.

## BIOL 205			<-- start of fall 2018
The second biology course in the general series. This was all about cell and molecular biology. I don't remember much about this except for that I started to hate biology because of all the memorization. There were a lot of premed students in this class. I took care of a plant for an experiment, and I took it home afterwards. It lived a long while but died since I didn't take good care of it.

## PLSC 346
The politics of inequality. The professor never mentioned [[Marx]], what a waste of a class. Now I could make the class hell with so many counters to the idiotic ideas of the professor. I got an A-. 

## PLSC 449
The politics of social movements. This class was actually good. However, it would have benefited greatly from a touch of the ol' Marxism. I still have the textbook somewhere. Sam Zilly was in this class with me. I got a B+.

## BIOL 206			<-- start of winter 2018/19
This was the last biology class in the series. I just wanted to be dome with memorizing names of structures at this point. I got to cut open a squid which was cool. I got a B-.

## ENVS 303
This class was about environmental ethics. Sort of interesting, but not really a great argument to be made when we stop centering humans in our ethical analysis in my opinion. This was the only class in which we actually read something by Marx, which is interesting. I got an A-.

## PHYS 161
Introduction to physics. Sort of fun but challenging. The labs were really easy with ramps and carts usually. Otherwise it was unmemorable. Professor was French. I got a B-.

## ECI 302			<-- start of spring 2019
This was a course on environmental disturbance. It wasn't taught very well but it was interesting. The professor was a Department of Fish and Wildlife dude. Lots of talk about forest fires, natural disasters. I got an A. 

## ESCI 325
Introduction to ecology. It was taught by David Wallin, a really old dude who was kind of a character. He didn't bother to remember anyone's name. I didn't learn anything new in this class. I got a B.

## ESCI 340
Biostatistics taught by Rebecca Bunn. I got a taste of programming in [[R]] which was interesting. I didn't really enjoy this one that much other than that, but I use things learned in this class all the time now. I got a B. 

## PLSC 397W
This class was a history of [[communism]]. It was taught by somebody who grew up in [[Russia]] just before the collapse of the USSR. It was very interesting, and not horribly biased against the left. I still have the textbook. I got an A. 

## ENVS 320			<-- summer 2019
This was an online GIS class over the summer. This was a fun experience, I would go to a coffee shop and sit and work which was really nice. For a long time, I thought that a career in GIS would be a good option. I got a B.

## CHEM 251			<-- fall 2019
Organic chemistry. This course was taught horribly. The TA for the lab seemed like he had no idea what was going on, and the labs didn't line up with the lecture at all. When the TA was criticized by my lab partner, the TA threatened to lower my partner's grade! 

## ESCI 361
Water quality. One of the best classes I took. The labs were really interesting, we took samples from a nearby wetland and performed chemical analysis on our samples. The professor was really nice and helpful. I got my research project through one of the TAs for lab. I got a B+. 

## ESCI 492
A class on [[climate change]] taught by Andy Bunn. Awesome class. Another taste of R and Andy was my favorite professor. It was very educational without really being hard which is a good balance. I got an A-.

## ESCI 499A
This was the Huxley speaker series. I just took this for the credit, I hardly ever went. 

## ESCI 380			<-- winter 2020
Energy and the environment. This class was relatively wasy, but the professor was so bad at explaining simple concepts that it totally drained my will to try in the class. As a result, I got a C. 

## ESCI 435
Landscape ecology with Andy Bunn. This was my favorite class overall. Very big picture and lots of [[modeling]] in R. I still have my notes and the papers I wrote in Google Drive. I got an A. 

## ESCI 442
A course on [[remote sensing]] with David Wallin. Very interesting, and very applicable to [[data science]]. I would love to work with sattellite imagery again. Wallin knew nobody's name, of course. I made a land-use classification map of Whatcom County. I got an A-.

## ESCI 453 
The science and management of contaminated sites, or SMoCS. It was taught by Ruth Sofield, who was a total hardass. She had a weird, cultlike following among the toxicology students. This class taught me that I did *not* want to go into this field. 

## ESCI 498B
This was my research project. It was very fun and not that hard. Lots of working in the greenhouse, which was honestly relaxing. I would often eat lunch in there because it was quiet. 

## ESCI 407			<-- spring 2020
This class was about [[forest ecology]]. I was really looking forward to the field trips, but it was online due to [[COVID-19]]. Therefore, it was super lame. I just phoned it in and got my grade waived due to COVID, so it was really a waste of time. 

## ESCI 454
This was SMoCS II. This was my capstone where I did [[PCA]] in R. It was way over my head to be honest, but it got me interested in data science. My group was pretty cool too. I got an A. 

## ESCI 497Z
This course was about UAV technology. I would have been able to actually fly drones and take pictures for analysis if it weren't for [[COVID-19]]. Since it was online, it was just about FAA regulations and I just cheated my way through the whole class. I got an A-.
