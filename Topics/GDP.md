# Gross Domestic Product
---
Gross domestic product, or GDP, is defined as the market value of all goods and services produced in a specific area. 

[[GDP measures the economic output of a given geographic area]]. For example, firms owned by shareholders in the [[USA]] which produce goods in [[China]] count towards Chinese GDP. 

On the other hand, [[GNI]] measures the value of the products and services produced by the citizens of a given country, regardless of where these products are produced.
