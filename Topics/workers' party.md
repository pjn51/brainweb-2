## The need for a workers' party
The question of the creation of a workers' party in the US is an essential question of #tactic for the US left. A [[class independence|class independent]], mass organization, based in the [[unions]] is an essential step forward in the organization of the working class as a whole in the US. 

## Creation of a workers' party
We see that there are at least two models for the creation of a workers party. In the [[UK]], the unions emerged first and combined into a workers party. However, in Germany, the [[reformism|Social Democratic]] Party emerged first, and was the leading force in building the unions in Germany. 

A workers' party could emerge from the unions directly, could split off from the Democrats, or could even split off of the Republicans in a certain context! No matter what, the unions would be essential to give the party a mass character. Of course, the unions would likely be the right wing of such a party, but their support would be essential.
