## What is Moralism?
Moralism, as it relates to [[Marxism]], is the unfortunately all-too-common method of determining tactical approaches based on the action's moral virtue rather than the outcome of the action. While Marxism sets out from a fundamental moral statement, "The development of humanity is good," Marxists are ultimately concerned with the outcome of a given action, and judge actions based on if their outcome helps accomplish the central goal of Marxism, the movement of humanity in a progressive direction.

This method is distinct from other methods that are common. [[Anarchism]] is based in deep-seated moralism when it comes to building organizations. They refuse to utilize any organizational structure that is 'hierarchical,' since they want to use these organizations to build a non-hierarchial future. They view the participation in, and development of hierarches as immoral, and refuse to utilize them on that basis. My full critique of anarchism can be found elsewhere.

Moralizers can be found in other segments of the left as well. [[ultraleftism|Ultraleftists]] tend to have a deeply moralistic view of politics. Some view all white workers as 'settlers,' and refuse to organize among them on a moral basis. Many allow this moralistic view to cloud the movements of the past, refusing to criticize the [[Black Panther Party]] for instance. 

Organizations that choose to organize the [[lumpenproletariat]] often make a moral argument to support their choice. Authentic Marxists choose to organize the working class not because it's the right thing to do, *but becuase it is the only way to overthrow capitalism.*  If it were possible to organize the [[petty bourgeoisie]] into a revolutionary hammer with which the system could be smashed, we would be doing that. If the lumpens were really the only revolutionary force, we would be organizing them instead of the workers.  

## Moralism and Virtue Ethics
In some ways, moralism can be seen as the application of [[virtue ethics]] to politics. The goal of a political moralist is not to change the world, just to be a good person. Actually, it now seems to me that moralism is nothing but virtue ethics applied to politics. 

The emergence of virtue ethics in the field of politics makes sense. In the long shadow of repeated failure of movements to fundamentally change the world, the idea that we should just focus on our own virtue is deeply cynical. 

## Towards a Revolutionary Moralism
[[Marxism relies on moral assertions]], but we also assert that the end justifies the means.
