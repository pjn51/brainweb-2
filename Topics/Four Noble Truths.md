---
The Four Noble Truths are the most basic expression of [[Buddhism]]. They are best understood not as static beliefs, but as categories of experience or tasks we ought to perform. 

# The Truths as categories of experience

1. The truth of suffering: [[Buddhists believe that suffering is innate]]
2. The truth of the cause of suffering
3. The truth of the end of suffering
4. The truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering

The ordinary way we catergorize reality can be simplified down to two variables: me / not-me, and being / not-being. Instead of this, the Truths propose different variables: cause / effect, and skillful / unskillful. 

  __ | Skillful | Unskillful
---|---|---
Cause | (4) The truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering | (2) The truth of the cause of suffering
Effect | (3) The truth of the end of suffering | (1) The truth of suffering 

Some people criticize Buddhism as being pessimistic. They don't see that Buddhism must start with a diagnosis of life's problems if we are to solve them. 

Another criticism is that Buddhism focuses too much on the issues of suffering. One of the most important realizations that led to the [[Buddha]]'s awakening was that understanding pain lay at the heart of his spiritual journey. 

# The Truths as tasks
[[secular buddhism|Secular]] interpreters like [[Stephen Batchelor]] like to think of the 4 NT as tasks rather than static beliefs. 

1. Embrace reality and the suffering found there.
2. Let go of the blind reactivity that causes suffering. 
3. See the reactivity fade away and see the world from a more clear perspective.
4. Act on our new wisdom to allow us and those around us an easier existance. 

# Why Study the Four Noble Truths?
We study these four categories of experience, so that we can apply them to our life and know how to act properly towards each of them. In this way, we can attain happiness.

# The First Noble Truth
[[Buddhists believe that suffering is innate]]. 
We have to deal with suffering throughout our whole life, and there's no escape from it. From the richest to the poorest, we all have to deal with the fundamental problems of birth, aging, sickness, and death eventually. 

We will all have to deal with being separated from those we love, and losing the things we value. It is the clinging onto what the Buddha calls the *five aggregates* that causes us to suffer. 

## The Five Aggregates
- Form
- Feeling
- Perception
- Mental fabrications
- Consciousness

The five aggregates become the five clinging-aggrigates when we cling on to them and refuse to admit their true nature as impermanent. 

# The Second and Third Noble Truths
Since suffering arises from specific phenomena, it must also have an end if the specific phenomena can be ended. 

The Buddha talked about how the Dharma and the idea of "dependent co-arising" are one and the same. 

# The Fourth Noble Truth
By following the [[Eightfold Path]], we can end our suffering.
