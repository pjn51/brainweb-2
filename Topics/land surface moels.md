# Introduction
Land surface models are [[modeling]] approaches that seek to describe energy partitioning and water stores / fluxes for the field of [[environmental science]]. 

They can be broken down into two parts: the *physics,* which describe the complex real world by a set of equations, hopefully based on our understanding of physics. The other part is the *parameters,* which adapt the approximated physics to work over hetrogenous surfaces.
