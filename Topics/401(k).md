# Introduction
A 401(k) is a [[economics|financial]] term for a retirement savings plan that gives you tax advantages. The employee agrees to have a certain percentage of their paycheck deposited into an investment account, usually a [[mutual fund]]. The employer will match some part of that percentage. 

The funds can be withdrawn after the employee is 60, otherwise there will be a tax penalty. 

There are two kinds, traditional and Roth.

# Traditional
A traditional 401(k) is deducted from the employee's gross income. The deduction reduces the taxable income and can be reported as a tax deduction for the year. Taxes will be paid on the [[currency|money]] *when it is withdrawn.*

# Roth
A roth 401(k) is deducted from *after-tax* income. When the money is withdrawn at retirement, no taxes will be paid on it. This is a better option when your tax bracket is lower than you expect it to be upon retirement.
