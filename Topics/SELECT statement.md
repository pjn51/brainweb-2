# SELECT statement
---
In [[SQL]], the `SELECT` statement is one of the most common data statements. It generates a result set according to a query. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

There are multiple clauses that can be used as part of a `SELECT` statement. 

1. [[FROM clause]]
2. [[WHERE clause]]
3. [[GROUP BY clause]]
4. [[HAVING clause]]
5. [[ORDER BY clause]]

If we want to get the unique rows from the result set, we use `SELECT DISTINCT`.
