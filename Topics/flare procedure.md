# Flare Procedure
`LINKS:` [[Crohn's disease]]

---
For my [[Crohn's disease]], it's in my interest to develop a flare procedure so that I know what to do when the disease strikes. 

# Water intake
As my symptoms worsen, I should be keeping track of my water intake. My prior hospitalization was likely due to dehydration from all the vomiting. When I vomit, I should mentally note how much liquid is coming up and if I can't drink that much liquid before vomiting again, I should probably go to the hospital or prepare to do so. 

# Diet
The next most important thing is keeping myself strong by eating. Even though I really don't want to eat when I have symptoms, *I have to eat to get better*. I should start with a liquid diet of chicken broth or nutrient shakes, and then work up to soft foods like bananas if my symptoms don't worsen within a few hours of eating. 

# Investigation
I should think back over the last 24 hours, and over the last month. Did I deviate from my normal diet at all in the last 24 hours, or has the previous month seen an increase in one food type or a combination? These questions would help me to get a grip on a possible cause.
