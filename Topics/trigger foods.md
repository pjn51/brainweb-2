# Introduction
This is a list of confirmed / suspected triggers for my [[Crohn's disease]] symptoms. It is remarkably hard to *prove* that a food is causing long-term inflammation, apart from reintroducing one of these and seeing if my symptoms get worse. I'm not doing that, so these foods will likely remain suspects for the rest of my life. 

# Suspects
- Dairy
- Fried food
- Sugary foods
- Wheat (gluten)
