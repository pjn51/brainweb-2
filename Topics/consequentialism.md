# Consequentialism
[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/)

This is the view in [[ethics]] that the moral character of any action depends on the consequences of the action. In other words, [[Consequentalists judge based on outcome]]. 

## Classical Utilitarianism
The classic utilitarians held the position of *hedonistic act consequentialism.* The idea of *act consequentialism* is that an act is morally good only if the act maximizes the good compared to all the other actions someone could take. These thinkers combined that idea with a hedonistic view of what is good. 

This view is summarized by the saying that an act is right if it causes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. But this is a little bit misleading. Classic utilitarians seek to maximize the net good in the world possible based on the set of actions available at the moment.
