# Deontology
---
A field of [[philosophy]], [[Deontology proposes universal ethical rules]] for behavior. 

I think that [[Deontology is anti-dialectical]]. [[Morality is historically contingent]], and creating a rule that stands outside of context is too [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] for my liking. 

[[Kantian ethics are deontological]].
