# Linear regression
---
Linear regression is the simplest [[regression]] [[modeling]] algorithm. We model the relationship between the target feature and the other features like so...

$$
y=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_nx_n
$$

...where $y$ is the target feature (aka dependent variable) and $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the other features (aka independent varibles). 

Typically, [[Linear regression uses least squares approximation]]. 

# Assumptions
- [[Linear regression assumes linear relationship]]
- [[Linear regression assumes independence]]
- [[Linear regression assumes homoscedasticity]]
- [[Linear regression assumes normality]]
