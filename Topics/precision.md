$$
\text{precision} = \frac{ \text{true positives} }{ \text{true positives + false positives} }
$$

## Introduction
Precision is one of the [[metrics]] that we can use for [[classification]] [[modeling]] tasks. Precision asks how many observations that we thought were positive were really positive. We can use it to grade how confident we can be in our model's predicted positives.

## Definition
Precision is defined as the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives.
