# Introduction
Studied in [[biology]] and [[environmental science]], a symbiotic relationship is one in which two or more organisms rely on one another to survive. 

# Varieties
Symbiotic relationships can be mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic.

## Mutualism
In a mutualistic relationship, each [[species]] engaged in the relationship has a net benefit. 

## Commensalism
In a commensalistic relationship, one species benefits while the other species is unaffected.

## Parasitism
In a parasitic relationship, one species benefits while the other is harmed.
