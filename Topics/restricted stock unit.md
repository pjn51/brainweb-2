# Restricted Stock Unit
---
A restricted stock unit (RSU) is a unit of [[stock]] that is awarded by an employer to an employee based on a vesting schedule. When the RSUs vest, they're assigned a "fair market value" and are treated as income for tax purposes. 

Since the mid 2000s, RSUs have surpassed stock options in popularity.
