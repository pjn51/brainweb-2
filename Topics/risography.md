# Risography

# Introduction
This is an [[art]] method that uses a special printer to print layers of colors on a print. 

# Line Width
It's ok to make really thin lines! 

# Color
Riso is good at rendering transparency. It can deal with shades of lighter or darker colors in the print, unlike [[screenprinting]].

The unique thing about riso is that we have to apply colors one by one. If our canvas has red, black, and green, we send first a red layer, then a black layer, and a green layer, all of which are printed on top of one another. That means that if you're setting up a canvas on [[procreate]], make sure each color is in a unique layer. 

We need to apply **trap** in riso, because there might be a little bit of mis-alignment between the color layers. Make the color layers overlap a tiny bit to avoid errors. 

# Printing Style
We can choose to have little dots like a comic, called 'screentone' or we can have 'graintouch' which is more filled in but grainier. 

# Canvas Preparation for [[risography]]
Make sure all colors are in unique layers. Then, turn all the layers black and export as .psv file. In photoshop, we can turn this digital file into something ready to print. 

Merge the linework together, to be printed last as the outline layer.
