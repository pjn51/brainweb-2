# What is the Enneagram?
The enneagram models personality through a system of centers, wings, and levels of development.

There are nine basic personality types, labeled by number. These basic types are connected to one another following this pattern.

Everyone has a dominant personality type, and could be said to be a "type 2" or "type 4" for example. These types are unchanging throughout a person's life, although some may draw from multiple types at once. [[I don't fully agree with the Enneagram model]] but still think it has useful purposes. I also doubt the validity of another principle: [[The Enneagram model views type as static]]. 

[[I'm an Enneagram Five]] and [[Eylen is an Enneagram Six]].
