# Spaced Repetition
---
Spaced repetition is a strategy for retaining knowledge and improving information recall. [[Ebbinghaus coined the 'forgetting curve']] to describe the fact that we forget most learned info within 24 hours of learning it. 

[[Spaced recall slows down the 'forgetting curve']], allowing us to remember things longer.
