# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a [[regression]] technique for mapping a [[discrete and continuous variables|continuous]] input to a binary output. [[Logistic regression uses a link function]] to relate these inputs to outputs. 

See my [[1-26-21 metis#Lecture logistic regression theory|lecture notes]] on the topic.
