# Benford's Law
---
According to Benford's Law, in many sets of numerical [[data]], the leading digit is likely to be small. Benford tested this law against the surface area of 355 rivers, the size of 3200+ US populations, 1800 molecular weights, 308 numbers in a random copy of *Reader's Digest,* the street addresses of 340 people in a textbook, and 418 death rates. 

This concept was first noticed in 1881, by Simon Newcomb. However, it was named for Benford in 1938.

[[Benford's Law can detect altered data]], but [[Benford's Law assumes variable magnitude]].
