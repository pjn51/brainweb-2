# Introduction
The Third Camp tradition was created by [[Draper]], [[Shachtman]], and other thinkers who left the [[SWP (USA)]]. They argued that the [[Russia|USSR]] was a new social order, neither [[socialism|socialist]] or [[capitalism|capitalist]], and that the USSR was engaging in [[imperialism]]. 

Therefore, they called for the organizing of a "third camp" that would oppose both capitalism and the USSR.
