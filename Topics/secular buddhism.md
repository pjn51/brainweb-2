Secular Buddhism is a school of [[Buddhism]] that was born when Buddhism began to establish a foothold in Europe and North America. Secular Buddhists seek to divorce the teachings of the [[Buddha]] from what they see as mysticism and ceremony that has grown around the original teachings after thousands of years of practice. 

Secular Buddhists claim that Buddhism started out as a pragmatic and therapeutic way of life, and method for dealing with suffering. Only after it was soaked in the cultues of the societies in which it existed, (and forced to conform to the economic conditions, I would add) did it add all the metaphysical statements that mainsteam Buddhism now has. These claims include the idea of rebirth and [[karma]]. 

[[Stephen Batchelor]] is a famous Secular Buddhist who has written some of the foundational texts for Secular Buddhists, such as *Buddhism Without Beliefs* and *After Buddhism*. His work has focused on trying to understand the central teachings of the Dharma as tasks instead of beliefs, particularly the [[Four Noble Truths]]. 

Batchelor views the Four Noble Truths as tasks essential for living a good life in the world, and has redefined these Truths as tasks following the acronym ==ELSA==: Embrace, Let go, See / Stop, Act. By embracing whatever we're currently feeling, and letting go of our attempts to control that which is out of our hands, we are able to stop the normal patterns of reactivity and see our situation much more clearly. In this state of mind, it is much easier to act in a skillful way, with clear intention.
