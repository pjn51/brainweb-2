# Introduction
Trotskyism is a Marxist current basing itself of the works of [[Trotsky]] and the thinkers in his tradition. 

*In my opinion*, Trotskyism is the genuine sucessor to [[Marx]]'s, [[Engels]]', and [[Lenin]]'s legacy, but in the interest of objectivity I'm defining it as separate from orthodox [[Marxism]]. 

# Validity of the term
I'm not sure how valid the label of "Trotskyist" is. I don't really consider myself a Trotskyist any more than I consider myself an Engels-ist or a Leninist. I think that Trotsky was a genuine Marxist, and I defend the advances he made in the field and in the world, but I don't uphold him as some kind of icon or something.
