# Possible Reductions to Global Carbon Emissions
---
## Introduction
After reading [[Desert (2011)]], I feel compelled to investigate possible ways to reduce carbon emissions in a globally [[economic planning|planned economy]] in order to fight [[climate change]].

## Goals
According to [this source](https://climatecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/presidentialaction.pdf) we need to reduce global CO2 emissions by roughly 60% by 2050. 

## 1. Elimination of military spending
[[Military spending is massively pollutive]], eliminating it would reduce global emissions by 0.4% alone. 

## 2. Transition to nuclear power
[[Nuclear power has potential as a bridge fuel]], and 75% nuclearization would reduce global $\text{CO}_2$ emissions by 19%. 

## Conclusion
So far, I've accounted for a 19.4% decrease in global carbon emissions. We need a 60% reduction by 2050 if we want to stabilize carbon concentrations in the atmosphere.
