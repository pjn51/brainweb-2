# Free Will
`LINKS:` [[philosophy]]

## The Existential perspective 
[[Existentialism|Existentialists]] tend to believe in free will. 

[[Sartre]] contrasted the *being* of inanimate objects with the *being* of consciousnesses. He said that every object has a *being in-itself*, while entities that are conscious have a *being for-itself.* By this, he meant that unconscious entities just fufill their nature without any choice, while humans, having [[class consciousness]], can decide for ourselves what our *nature* shall be. Sartre says that a consciousness is *a nothing,* meaning that a consciousness is free to determine its own nature. 

I tend to disagree. I think this reeks of [[idealism]]. I am a human, and that is my nature. I cannot decide to be a tree, or become a cloud or something. I do have free will, but only within a limited range of options that Sartre doesn't seem to take into account. 

As [[Marx]] said, 

> Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. 

That's basically where I stand on the question of free will.

## An argument from evolution
[[Evolution indicates the existence of free will]]. If we take it as a given that [[evolution]], in the long run, only results in changes to an organism that are in some way beneficial, and that humanity evolved at some point from an organism that lacked consciousness, then this implies that consciousness is in some way beneficial to humanity. 

If that is true, then this implies some change in behavior that is a result of our being conscious. If we had no free will, then there would be no advantage to consciousness over unconscious impulse. Therefore, humans have *some* degree of free will.

[[Trotsky]] makes a similar argument in his *Notebooks.*
