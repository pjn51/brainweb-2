# Introduction
The lumpenproletariat, according to [[Marxism]], is a class in society below the [[proletariat]] and [[peasantry]]. [[Marx]] called them the passively rotting scum of capitalist society. They play no real role in production, and modern examples of lumpen elements would be the prison population, the homeless, and criminals. 

# Revolutionary potential?
Some theorists, such as [[Huey P. Newton]] see the lumpenproletariat as a possibly revolutionary class, but Marxism disagrees since they don't wield any power over capitalist production. 

Marxists choose to organize the working class not only because of the oppression that the workers face, but the fact that they have enough leverage to bring about a social revolution. 

A misunderstanding of this concept leads some to believe that revolutionaries should work among the most oppressed as an end in itself. While some members of the lumpen are certainly radical, their class position prevents them from having as much social power and influence as an overturning of the state and class society requires. 

Advanced layers of the lumpen would certainly play a progressive role in a revolution, but it's unscientific to think that the lumpen could lead a revolution by themselves. 

# Dynamics of the lumpen population
[[Huey P. Newton]] thought that due to automation and centralization of [[capital]], the lumpenproletariat would increase in size and come to be the largest class. This has been demonstrated to be false. The labor force participation has been basically stable between the 70s and today. This is because production of [[commodities]] requires consumers to buy them! When a crisis of overproduction occurs, [[means of production]] are destroyed until a new balance is reached, preventing a total disintegration of the capitalist system.
