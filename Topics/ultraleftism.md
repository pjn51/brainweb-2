# Ultraleftism
---
See [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]] for [[Lenin]]'s analysis of ultraleftism as it relates to the workers' movement in western Europe. 

Ultraleftism is the opposite of [[opportunism]]. While the opportunist waters down their socialist principles in order to win power sooner, often breaking the principle of [[class independence]], the ultraleftist refuses to "stoop" to the level of the actual movement, demanding that the workers leave their existing organizations and become fully-conscious Communists before the ultraleftist will work with them. 

In *Left Wing Communism,* [[Lenin]] highlights how ultraleftists demanded that the workers leave their [[unions]] and join new, 'radical' unions. He said that this was a grand mistake. In fact, he said it was “...tantamount to the greatest service Communists could render the bourgeoisie.”
