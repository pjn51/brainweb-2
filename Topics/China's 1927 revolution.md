# China's 1927 revolution
---
In 1927, [[China]] had a failed [[Revolutionary situations|revolution]]. We can partially blame this failure on the [[CPC]] and [[Comintern]] - it was because of them that [[Collaborationism doomed China's 1927 revolution]]. 

It was because of the failure of this revolution that [[Maoism]] was developed as a theoretical trend. [[Maoism was a product of proletarian defeat]].
