For an intro, see my [[1-27-21 metis]] notes. 

Networking is an important part of getting your [[career]] going, and keeping yourself included in the [[data science]] community. 

Many people don't like to network, but you don't have to look at it as a chore. The best attitude to take towards networking is that you should just try and meet interesting people that you have something in common with. 

Don't just try and find the person with the best connections and convince them to get you a job. They will see right through that and it's really annoying. Instead, just try and make friends. Even if those friends don't have any leads on a job right now, if they do in the future they will remember the nice and (hopefully) interesting person that they met at an event, not the annoying pushy person who only seemed to be interested in them until he heard that the company wasn't hiring. Play the long game!
