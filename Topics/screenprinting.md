# Screenprinting
`LINKS:` [[art]]

---
# Introduction
Screenprinting is a visual [[art]] technique. 

# Hyperparameters
This is *not* the correct lingo to be using with visual art, but that's fundamentally what's going on when you're tweaking something and the result changes. 

## Trap
Trap means that you have two colors overlap a bit so that the layers don't get gaps when they're printed. The layers might be a bit off so best to leave some wiggle room. 

## Color
Colors are applied one by one in different layers. That means that if you're preparing a print in [[procreate]], you need to have each color as a separate layer.
