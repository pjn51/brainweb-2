---
Relational [[database]] Management Systems, or RDBMS, are methods for [[data wrangling]]. 

Inside RDBMS, the [[data]] are stored in objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data, and consists of columns and rows. 

Each table is broken up into entities called fields. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific info about all the records in the table. 

[[SQL]] is a classic RDBMS.
