Queer theory is a school of thought, predominantley among [[academy|academics]], that views social development through a more-or-less [[idealism|idealist]] lens of [[identity politics]], namely sexual identity politics.

For a [[Marxism|Marxist]] critique, see [[Marxism vs Queer Theory (2020)]]. 

When it comes to [[The dialectic of particular and universal]], [[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that QT takes a one-sided approach. That is, [[Queer Theory rejects the universal]].
