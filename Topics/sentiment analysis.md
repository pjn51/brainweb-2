# Sentiment Analysis
---
Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting [[emotion|emotional]] content in text, using [[machine learning]]. It's a common [[NLP]] task. 

Usually, tools report the *subjectivity* and *polarity* of text. Subjectivity represents how emotionally laden the text is, while polarity measures if the text is positive or negative in tone. 

At the simplest end of the spectrum, [[Naive Bayes can measure sentiment]].
