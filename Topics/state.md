# The State

> [!note]
> This refers to the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] state. For a discussion of the state after capitalism, see [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. 

[[States are instruments of class domination]], and [[Armed force is the defining feature of the state]]. 

Under [[capitalism]], the [[bourgeoisie]] is the ruling class, and maintains that position using, among other methods, the state. When the police (with the court system behind them) deter property damage, break strikes, and enforce contracts, that's the work of the state to uphold [[capitalism]] and protect the position of the capitalist class. 

The state developed first in the agrarian feudal nations in the Fertile Crescent of what we now refer to as the Middle East. [[Class antagonism necessitated the state]], then and now. 

For more on the historical development of the state, see the [[stages of historical development]]. 

The feudal, monarchical states of Europe were largely overthrown in the bourgeois revolutions, such as the [[France|French revolution]], but [[Social development is always uneven]] and elements of [[feudalism]] remain in some countries. 

[[The workers must build their own state]], a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].
