# Economic Planning
---
Under [[socialism]] and [[communism]], the economy must be planned by the [[proletariat|working class]]. This allows for a serious rise in productivity and standards of living, since [[Planned economies outperform market systems]]. For instance, [[The USSR lacked inflation, homelessness, and debt]] and [[Soviet WW2 victory vindicated the planned economy]]. 

Despite the advances made, the USSR *wasn't* a perfect model of a socialist planned economy. [[Socialism requires workers' democracy]], so that workers can provide accurate [[data]] and manage the economy themselves. Only this level of participation could allow us to reach the full potential for planned economics. 

However, [[Nationalization isn't inherently socialist]]. Capitalist states have conducted nationalization for various reasons throughout history. Indeed, we can see that [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]] today. 

The [[Russia|Soviet]] use of economic planning was one reason that [[The USSR wasn't state capitalist]].
