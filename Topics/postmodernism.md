# Introduction
Postmodernism is a school of [[philosophy]] that stands opposed to [[dialectical materialism]], as well as every other method of making sense of the world. It views all progress as totally subjective, and doesn't think that it's possible to analyze human development in a scientific way.

Postmodernist thinkers are skeptical of any historical narriative, even though their skepticism does create its own historical narriative (one that makes no sense whatsoever). They view all the events of history as seperate affairs that are not constrained and pushed forward by common features or patterns of behavior.

The ruling ideas of society tend to be the ideas of the ruling class. And the fact that postmodernism is the defacto reigning ideology in academia today signifies the fact that the [[bourgeoisie]] can no longer have any conception of forward progress for humanity. In an epoch where all they can do is attempt in vain to safeguard their wealth, it makes sense that there would be a prevailing attitude of helplessness and confusion when it comes to the direction of human development.
