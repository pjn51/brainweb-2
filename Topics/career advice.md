## From Andrew Walsh, Metis alumni
As part of the Winter 2019 cohort it was in a physical space. I continued going in to that space just like I did during class. So keep up the same habits you’ve had during class. And don’t forget to take a break every now and then.

You no longer have the formal structure from class, so make your own. For example:
Spend a fixed amount of time first thing in the morning working on some programming. This can help wake you up and put you in “I’m working” mode.

Then review your job searches. Did you get a response you need to address? Are there any new job postings of interest? This will be the time you determine or confirm any next actions you need to take.

The afternoons are going to be your least structured. This is the time do the work that you have identified: learning about a new topic; coding challenges; writing cover letters; interview practice; company research; etc.

Here are my tips:
- Don’t accept more than one coding challenge at a time. Learn from my mistake.
- Practice doing “white board coding” (e.g. “pretend [[Scikit-Learn]] doesn’t exist; implement \[[KNN]]”). This was much more nerve wracking than I expected.
- Don’t limit yourself. I’m absolutely love  my current job, and I almost didn’t apply! And the job I thought I wanted the most never responded to me.
- Don’t be afraid. Apply for that “stretch” job; if they respond it means they see something in you they like. They may not give you that specific job, but it could inspire them to, e.g. promote someone internally to the role and hire you to fill the new opening.
- For something to learn that might be helpful, I recommend PyEnv/PipEnv.
