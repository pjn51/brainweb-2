# Introduction
Root rot is a condition in [[plants]]. 

# Source
Root rot can occur because of two reasons. The first is prolonged overwatering that causes roots to die due to lack of oxygen. The dead roots can begin to rot, and the rot can spread to healthy roots even after soil conditions are corrected.

The second source is a fungal infection in the soil. This fungus can lie dormant and spring into action when the plant is overwatered once or twice. 

# Symptoms
Yellowing and wilting leaves, mushy and black roots. 

# Treatment
Remove plant from soil, wash the roots under running water. Next, use sharp scissors to trim away the affected roots. 

For a severe case, clean the scissors with rubbing alcohol and prune back 1/3 to 1/2 of the leaves. This will allow the plant to concentrate its resources on maintaining a smaller aboveground structure. 

Dispose of the soil and wash the pot with bleach. 

If possible, dip the remaining roots in a fungicide solution to kill off any remaining fungus. 

While regrowing, don't fertilize the plant.
