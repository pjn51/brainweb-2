I want to establish a more scientific accounting of our [[plants]]. This should start with a summary of all the plants, and their species (to gauge water and light needs). After that, I can establish a schedule for watering and checkups. 

There are 31 plants in this apartment as of 12/21/20. 

| Plant           | Location       | Schedule  |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Monstera 1      | By TV          | 1-2 weeks |
| Monstera 2      | Dinner table   | 1-2 weeks |
| Monstera 3      | Kitchen window | 1-2 weeks |
| Monstera 4      | Bedroom        | 1-2 weeks |
| Fiddle leaf fig | By TV          | 1-2 weeks |
| Calathea        | Kitchen window |           |
