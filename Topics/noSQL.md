## Introduction [^1]
NoSQL, or "not only [[SQL]]," is a type of non-relational [[database]] that can be used for [[data wrangling]]. There are no seperate tables like we would see in SQL, the whole data structure can be a single nested data model. 

Due to the low cost of data storage, noSQL databases give users the advantage of being able to host a huge amount of unstructured data, giving developers more flexibility.
