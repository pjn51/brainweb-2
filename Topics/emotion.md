An emotion, in [[psychology]], is defined as a "natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others."

I view emotion as this uncontrollable force, kind of like the wind. It sometimes blows through you and it sometimes doesn't. The main thing is to not let the emotions that are passing through you sweep you away or make you forget that they're just transient states of being and that [[Change is omnipresent]]. This draws from [[Buddhism]]. 

From a more psychological point of view, emotion is the way in which our subconscious mind communicates with our conscious mind. 

[[Factor analysis attempts to map emotion dimensionally]].
