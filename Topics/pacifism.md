# Introduction
Pacifism is the moral and political stance that violence is inexcusable. 

# Marxist critique
Pacifism is a fundamentally bourgeois [[liberalism|liberal]] attitude towards war and conflict. While Marxists oppose bourgeois wars of agression, and always place the onus of violence on the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[state]], Marxists understand that the [[proletariat]] will certainly have to defend itself from attack. This means that we cannot sky away from the eventual arming of the workers, and the formation of organs of self defence, closely tied to the [[mass organizations]] of the working class and to the [[vanguard]]. 

Advocating for an unprincipled peace serves the function of disarming the proletariat in the face of state and counter-revolutionary agression, and therefore plays a negative role in the class struggle. The far right and the state will never be swayed by pacifists, but some workers might be.
