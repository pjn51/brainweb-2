# Common pool resources
---
A "common pool resource," coined (as far as I know), by [[Ostrom]], is a finite resource that actors cannot be easily excluded from utilizing. Examples include pastures, fishing stocks, and forests. 

Ostrom's book, [[Governing the Commons (1990)]], was centered around finding ways that these CPRs could be effectively managed to prevent [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]]. 

A central message of that work is that [[Sustainability requires self-government]].
