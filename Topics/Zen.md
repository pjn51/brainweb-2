## What is Zen?
That's a really good question, and it's hard to answer. It is a school of [[Buddhism]], that's for sure. Zen teachers are really interested in the idea of [[meditation]], which they call "zazen" and the "direct transmission" of the dharma. 

## Schools of Zen
There are a couple schools of Zen. Rinzai is more into chanting and stuff, while Soto is more into Shikantaza, a method of meditation with no anchor or object of attention. 

Soto was founded by Dogen. 

Taking notes on Zen is funny because it really isn't zen at all...
