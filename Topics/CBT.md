Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is a type of therapeutic treatment meant to teach people how to identify and change destructive thought patterns that have a negative impact on behavior and emotions. [[CBT is a popular treatment for depression]]. 

[[CBT seeks to challenge cognitive distortion]]. 
 
[[CBT is action-oriented]]. 

Generally, a patient would meet with a therapist for about an hour per session. There would usually be 6-18 sessions spaced 1-3 weeks apart. Often, the therapist will assign homework to the patient, and gauge the next steps for treatment based on how successfully the patient completed the assignment. For example, a patient suffering from depression might be assigned to go to a social event. 

[[CBT relies on patient participation]]. 

## Varieties
[[DBT]], or dialectical behavior therapy, incorporates concepts of distress tolerance, acceptance, and minfulness (see [[meditation]]).
