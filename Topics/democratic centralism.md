# Democratic Centralism
---
Democratic centralism is an organizing principle for many left-wing organizations. [[Democratic centralism allows for freedom of debate, unity of action]]. This method of organization is entirely distinct from the idea of bureaucratic centralism, which is what the [[Comintern]] degenerated into after [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]]. Because of that, [[The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s]]. 

This method of organization takes [[The dialectic of unity and dissent]] into account, balancing the need to have both. 

# Freedom of debate
Only by raising all questions to the level of the political, and bringing these political questions to be debated openly among the members can we ensure that corruption or bad leadership won't steer our organizations wrong. This accounts for the fact that [[Organizational re-arrangement cannot solve political issues]]. It was this aspect of democratic centralism that was eroded by the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]]. 

# Unity of action
The revolutionary organization is not a debate club, and the period of discussion must come to an end eventually. When it does, the matter must be voted on and the organization must move on. [[The party is a combat organization]], not a reading group. 

This means that even those who disagree with the decision made by the organization must adhere to the party line on the matter. If the line is a mistake, at the next period of discussion it can be corrected, and the party can gain a lesson from the mistake and live to fight another day. If the decision isn't respected by those that disagree, the party is weakened and will be unable to act in the decisive role demanded of a revolutionary organization. 

This tends to alienate the [[petty bourgeoisie]], since [[The petty bourgeoisie prefers endless debate]]. 

# Accountability
[[Democratic centralism establishes two-way accountability]]. In this way, it has an advantage over horizontalism, since [[Horizontalism lacks accountability]].
