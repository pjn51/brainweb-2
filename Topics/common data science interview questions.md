## Understand what role you're interviewing for
There are many kinds of data scientist role. Make sure that you can prepare for the interview, particularly the technical interview, by understanding what kinds of projects you will be working on.

## View all questions through a technical lens
Candiates are often passed over because they don't seem technical enough. Candidates should be trying to demonstrate that they think in a concrete, technical way at all times. Even when questions don't seem to be technical on their face, we should be trying to demonstrate our technical skills.

## Be ready for open-ended questions
Open-ended questions allow the interviewer see how a candidate would really react to a problem on the job. Candidates have to understand the problem, define the boundaries and assumptions, and discuss the trade-offs of different approaches. 

There's likely no best answer, but an open ended question helps the employer see if you can think independently and justify your conclusions.

## 1. "Can you tell me about a recent project you've been working on?"
To answer this question well, a candidate must demonstrate *communication skills, teamwork, enthusiasm, and a strong moral compass.* Employers want somebody who can break down complex topics for a non-technical audience. They also want to see that you can work as a part of a team, since [[data science]] is a collaborative field. You should also be excited about the projects that you work on, and employers are impressed by somebody who thinks deeply about the ethical implications of their work, since it shows that you are aware of the way that your project will be deployed and the long-term ramifications. 

## 2. "Can you break down an algorithm you used on a recent project?"
On top of determinging your undesrtanding of algorithms, his question is trying to determine if you understand the assumptions that each algorithm makes, as well as the other factors that go into deciding when to use one over another.

You should also talk about [[hyperparameters]], [[complexity]], and how well the algorithm worked in the project you're discussing. Also make sure to demonstrate an *iterative* approach, starting with simple models and only embracing complexity when needed. 

## 3. "What tools did you use in a recent project and why?"
This is similar to the previous question, in that an employer wants to see that you understand the appropriate time to use each algorithm. They also want to know that you can back up your choices and communicate these decisions to non-technicl audiences. 

## 4. "How did you help solve the problem your recent project presented?"
Focus on the value that you added by solving the problem. 

## 5. "Tell me about a challenge you faced during the course of this project."
Employers want to know that you can face adversity well, and work around roadblocks. They want to know what your attitude is when faced with a problem. You should demonstrate that you can be proactive and think critically to get around problems that come up.

## 6. "Looking back, if you could do one thing differently or improve just one thing on the project, what would it be?"
This is the"pull-apart" question. The employer wants to see that your knowledge base has grown over time, and that you have a desire to continually improve. This question is meant to weed out employees who are over-confident in their past work, or who refuse to take criticism. 

Think about the challenges that you faced in the project, and think about what you could have done to avoid those challenges. 

## 7. "Let's refer back to XYZ technical problem you solved. If you had an infinite budget, what would be the first thing you'd do to fix that same problem?"
The safest answer here is to say that access to more data would be the first thing to do. Explain what data you would get, and how that data would make it easier or faster to solve the problem. Saying that you would invest in new equipment or state-of-the-art models demonstrates that you have a misunderstanding of how data science challenges are usually solved.
