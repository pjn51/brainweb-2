# ENVS 202: Introduction to Environmental Studies and Sustainability
`LINKS:` [[environmental science]]

# Why should we care about the environment?
Because we all live within the [[environmental science|environment]] and need clean air and water to survive. Also, I love hiking and snowboarding and want to continue to be doing those things. We shouldn’t fuck up our own future for super-short-term gains. 

## How do humans rely on the environment?
We need water to drink and air to breathe as well as places to grow food. We also need shelter. We have to live within a closed system. 

## What services do trees provide for humans?
Trees provide building material, fuel for fire and machines, shade, anti-erosion, a habitat for other creatures to be hunted, aesthetic value, a place to carve a heart, a record of history within the tree, carbon sequestration, oxygen, water filtration, climate regulation, and nutrient regulation.

# Environmental services
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment came up with this term to describe the ecosystem. There are four kinds of services.

Supporting services | Provisioning services | Regulating services | Cultural services
---|---|---|---
Services which make other services possible | Products obtained from the environment | Services which regulate the environment as a whole | Services which benefit people in nonmaterial ways
Nutrient cycling, Soil formation | Timber, Venison | Erosion control, Flood mitigation|Aesthetics, Recreation
	
# What is sustainability?
> “Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” - Bruntland Report for the World Commission on Environment and Development.

Another way to think about it is that sustainability lies at the convergence of environmental, social, and economic needs. 

# Climate change
After viewing The Day After Tomorrow, people are more concerned about [[climate change]] than before. Viewers are also more likely to believe that stronger natural events are probable in our near future.

There are a few ways scientists try to figure out what the climate used to be. They use ice cores to establish atmospheric changes, tree rings to track precipitation, and a lot of other sources of data. These [[data]] sources show us that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing for a long time. The average temperature variation from the norm has also been increasing. 
        
## Common misconceptions about climate change
Weather and climate are different! Weather is made up of short term conditions while climate is all about very long term conditions. 

The Ozone hole and climate change are different! The Ozone hole is caused by CFCs that people were using in aerosols, which broke the ozone layer up around the south pole. The Montreal Protocol banned most uses of CFCs. 

## The Greenhouse Effect
Incoming solar radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and surface materials on the ground, and the heat which isn't absorbed is radiated out into space again. Having a ton more greenhouse gases means that less heat is radiated out into space, causing the Earth to heat up over time. 

Greenhouse gases are normal and we would all die without them. But now we have so much of this shit that it’s catching way too much heat in the atmosphere. 

Albedo: the ability of a surface to reflect light

There are many things that reflect light and work against the increased greenhouse effect. 
* Clouds
* Ice and snow
* Biomass burning (wildfires)
* Barren lands
* Deserts and dust
* Aerosols (dust from coal burning)

Even while these processes cool the planet, they are not enough to counteract the increased greenhouse effect.

## Greenhouse Gases
CO2 is the greenhouse gas with the most warming potential even though it is far from the one with the most individual ability to absorb heat. There is a lot more CO2 than the others.

## GHG Sources
The biggest sources of greenhouse gases are electricity and heat, land use change, and agriculture. Land use change is a big one because it’s a double whammy. Usually land use change is deforestation and those carbon-reducing trees are then burned, increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Human activities have both positive and negative radiative forcing (positive and negative temperature change) on earth. At this point, we've caused a 2F increase in global temperature.
        Cooling factors don't get talked about very often because our positive forcing outweighs our negative forcing by a lot. 

## Positive [[feedback loops]]
Earth warms up ---> Ice melts ---> Albedo decreases ---> Earth warms up ---> etc

## Negative feedback loops
Ocean temp increases slightly ---> More evaporation ---> More clouds ---> Albedo increases ---> Temp decreases slightly

## T H E   F U T U R E
There has been a 2F increase in temp in the last 100 years. 
Our best case scenario is still shitty. Our worse case scenario is a 5-6C increase by 2080.
Vector borne illnesses will increase.

## Geoengineering
There are large-scale strategies that can address the challenge of climate change faster than other methods. For instance, we could shoot aerosols into the atmosphere to cool the earth. There’s a lot of uncertainty around these sorts of solutions because we don't know what the unintended consequences could be. 

## How are people experiencing climate change?
A lot of people who are under the effects of climate change right now are people in the third world and extreme climates, like Inuit people in North America and people in places like Bangladesh. Farmers and fishermen are also under the effects. Coastal communities in the US are facing imminent demise of their communities. There’s loss of habitat all across the world as well as more frequent forest fires.

## Climate Justice
Climate justice is all about who climate change is caused by, and how we can fairly distribute resources and costs. The top emitters of total greenhouse gas are China, the United States, and the European Union. It’s easy to go after China, but there are some complications. Around a third of their emissions are to supply the US with shit, and their population is really high. Per capita, the rankings are Canada, the United States, and the Russian Federation. Also, on a longer time scale, the United States and the [[EU]] are responsible for more than half of total emissions. 

## What can we do?
Mitigation is about minimizing the effect of the problem, while adaptation is when we change our behavior and live with the problem without solving it. (see geoengineering)

We can also use market based solutions which can incentivize or de-incentivize actions in order to help solve the problem of climate change.

## The Paris Agreement
This agreement was adopted in 2015 and put into effect in 2016. The agreement aims to hold to a 2C temperature increase, but there aren't really any negative effects for failing to meet a national goal of CO2 decrease. A ton of countries have agreed to this, and it has been being created and pushed since 1993. 

The Obama Administration was committed to the Agreement through the Clean Power Plan which aimed to reduce electricity emissions by 33%. The [[Trump]] Administration wants to withdraw from the Agreement and may get rid of the Clean Power Plan. The head of the EPA doesn't think humans cause climate change, so things are looking pretty rough. 

## Canadian Climate Action
British Columbia has an interesting policy mechanism to reduce emissions. They have a carbon tax, which is now at $30 per ton, or around $.30 per gallon of gas. All the [[currency|money]] from that goes back to citizens via tax cuts. Now, BC has a much lower rate of petroleum consumption than Canada, which has a lower rate than the US. 

# Global Population and the Anthropocene
There's a lot of people

Population growth rate = Birth Rate - Death Rate

Our current birth rate as of 2016 is 18.6 births per 1000 people per year. Our current death rate is 7.9 deaths per 1000 people per year. This means our population growth is 1.07% per year. It took 1,800 years to get to 1 billion people, but only 12 years to add our sixth billion in 1999.

## The Anthropocene
The era of humans. It is not universally accepted as the official name, but there is a lot of evidence that our activity is so great that it deserves the whole era named for our impact. We may have caused another great wave of mass extinction, our plastics are all over the ocean and shit, and we’re being bad boyz.

# Empirical vs Normative Claims
An [[empiricism|empirical]] claim is a claim about how the world works. It is a logical, provable, descriptive claim, like claiming the sky is blue. A normative claim is a claim about how the world ought to be. It’s a value statement and isn’t descriptive.

Malthus was a cleric in the 18th and early 19th centuries. He said that population increases exponentially while resources can only increase arithmetically. He believed there would be a crisis when the curve of population growth outstrips the availability of resources like food. He was wrong about that though because we are still alive...
Malthus used these supposed empirical claims in order to try to support social darwinism. This is fucked up ya

# The IPAT Formula
Environmental Impact (I) = Population (P) x Affluence (A) x Technology (T)

What is the carrying capacity of the Earth? What ecological footprint do we need to adhere to?

1. What characterizes the environmental movement?
2. What issues does it address?
   1. Clean air, clean water, deforestation, climate change, and other issues
3. What tactics do they employ?
   1. [[direct action]], civil disobedience, and protests
4. Who has been part of these movements?

# Historical Ideas of Nature and the Environment in the United States

## Manifest Destiny
That was a big idea 4 sure... this idea pervades [[USA|American]] culture to this day. People wanted to take all the shit. The “Rain Follows the Plow” notion was that if you plow land, then it will rain more on the ground, which is really dumb but whatever.

## The Homestead Act
The gov’t gave away other people's’ land to settlers for free. This was also lame

## Bison
Bison are dope. They get seeds in their hooves which spread plants and shit. Their hooves aerate the soil but dumb Europeans decided to kill them all. Those Europeans wanted to control everything but they couldn’t control themselves.

## Preservation vs Conservation
Maybe we shouldn't kill everything. The Preservationists wanted to leave everything as it is and totally not fuck with it. These dudes established National Parks and Wilderness Areas and that was chill. Conservationists said we should keep fucking it up but just sustainably fuck up the land. These dudes helped make National Forests and Wildlife Refuges and that was pretty chill but also practical so we could have dank wood and shit forever.

## Public Land in the US
Most public land is in the western states. There are lots of different types. There are National Parks, where you’re only allowed to look around and camp in designated areas. Dogs aren't even allowed in Parks. You can't hunt or go off trail, and you can't take anything out of the park. They have more of a preservation ethic of land management.

National Forests are more lenient. You can harvest timber and berries and go around all over the place. Sometimes conflicts between people wanting to use the forest for different things emerge. They allow a much wider range of uses, and are therefore more of a conservation ethic of management.

## The Endangered Species Act (1973)
Some say that this is the only ecocentric legislation in the US. It establishes recovery plans for endangered species, and tries to develop their habitat and protect it from encroachment. Protection of the home of species is a focal point and a great tool for land protection. Unfortunately, federal funding limits the scope of enforcement.

The Northern Spotted Owl was listed as threatened in 1990, causing logging in the PNW to be very limited. This pissed loggers off a lot because they were losing their jobs because of a tiny owl. 

## The WIlderness Act of 1964
This act allowed the feds to review areas of public lands that they deem “wild,” and set those areas aside as Wilderness Areas with extra protections. This is a total preservationist move.

## Wilderness vs Human Health
There's a split in the environmental movement about whether or not we should be focusing on human health or wild places. After the industrial boom of WWII, consumer culture exploded. Plastics were developed. All this increased production caused a number of health-related environmental crises. 

# Environmentalist Strategy
There are top-down and bottom-up strategies for change. Top-down strategy includes lobbying the government and trying to pass legislation while bottom-up strategy is all about building awareness and pressure. 

## Green Consumerism
There is a question of how involved industry ought to be in the environmental movement. Can companies be the flag bearers of the movement or will they always be the enemy of sustainability? There are lots of bad things that corporations do but sometimes they do good things.

# Earth Day
The first Earth Day was in 1970. It was a unifying moment for the worldwide environmental movement. Earth Day has totally been co-opted by consumerism and slacktivism. The Science March was on Earth Day this year. Science tries to be unbiased and unpolitical and therefore have a little conflict with the message of Earth Day, because they don't want to be looked at as partisan. 

# Environmental Justice
Some activists focus on the fact that pollution and other environmental harms are aimed at minority communities. Communities of color disproportionately have waste treatment and pollution in their areas.

## Majora Carter and Mark Lopez
These two people are environmental activists. They are concerned about urban environmental issues in poorer areas. They are concerned about the human impact of these issues. They use community engagement and organizing to fight these problems. They also focus on eco-entrepreneurialism.

## Flint, Michigan
The city of Flint switched their drinking water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River. The water crisis began when it came to light that all the pipes in the city weren’t able to handle the corrosion caused by the river, causing lead to get all in the water which is really bad. Lead exposure of children leads to lower IQs and could lead to increased crime rates. The proximate cause (condition or event which is immediately responsible) is that Flint switched water supplies. The root cause is complicated. The local gov’t didn't test the water, didn't tell people to treat their water, and there may have been a racial component to the problem. Flint is a majority poor and black community, which makes people think that the state doesn't care about the residents of Flint enough to stop the crisis. It has been over 3 years and there still isn't clean water for the residents. Also, you can't sell your home if it has lead in the pipes so all the people in Flint are stuck there. Some people have been threatened because they aren't paying their water bill.

## Environmental Injustice
This can include issues around distribution of environmental hazards, especially to lower income and non-white communities. It has to do with lack of involvement by disadvantaged communities in environmental decision making. It has to do with lack of recognition of the perspective of disadvantaged communities, and the lack of consideration of urban areas as needing environmental protection.

# The US Environmental Justice Movement
## Key Terms
Institutional racism: Forms of racism that aren't overt acts, they are implicit biases and practices throughout society.

White privilege: Unearned privileges held by people identified as white in the US. 

Spatial inequality: Social inequalities which are geographic in nature, like segregation. 

Intersectionality: Identities and systems of oppression are interlinked and must be confronted simultaneously.

# Paths to Sustainability: How Does Change Happen?
Structure: Societal arrangements that limit, facilitate, and guide human choices.

Agency:The ability of individuals to make free choices.

## Sustainable Cities
The overall trends are towards urbanization the world over. Over 50% of people now live in cities or other urban areas. The biggest cities are no longer in the Anglosphere. 

### The Problems of Cities
There are lots of problems, like waste management. It’s a lot more concentrated in cities and must be disposed of somewhere. There is also the urban heat island effect. Cities have to bring resources in from the outside and therefore can never be self-sufficient in its resources. There is also health and disease concerns in cities, and there is the threat of air pollution and congestion. Also, there is less green space in cities and more paved surfaces, which presents stormwater management challenges. 

The urban heat island effect is that sunlight is absorbed more by the black pavement and all the concrete, meaning that they get really hot. 

Air quality is also a problem. Many cities are over the concentration of particulates that the WHO says shouldn’t be exceeded. 

### Cities can Provide Solutions, too!
Cities usually have a lower per capita footprint, as there is an increase in shared energy and resources. Because everything is so close together, cars are less essential. Change can also be made through zoning rules faster than other places.

The average city resident has a lower footprint than the average country dweller. Transportation is a big part of this. It takes a lot more CO2 to transport people in cars than on a bus or in a subway train or on a bike.

### What Does a Sustainable City Look Like?
Cities like Curitiba and Copenhagen show us that cities can be pretty sustainable.

What does a city need to be sustainable?
* Culture of sustainability
* Physical infrastructure
* Effective and rapid public transit
* City planning and design; mixed use
* Alternative transport (bikes)
* Direct energy heating / cooling
* Residential density
* Urban and community gardens
   * Aquaponics can provide a lot of good shit

### Suburbanization
Bad! There are 40 million acres of lawn in the US and they all are bad grass. I hate grass because it is bad. There are lots of structures that encourage people to have big green lawns.
