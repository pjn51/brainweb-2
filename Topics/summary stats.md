# Overview
The easiest way to summarize a large dataset is to create a probability distribution for a single variable within the [[data]]. A probability distribution shows us the [[probability]] that a randomly selected variable would have a specific value within the range of the whole dataset. 

# Central tendency
This is the central value of a probability distribution. It can be measured many ways. 
Arithmetic mean refers to the arithmetic average of a group of values. 
$$m = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}$$

Median refers to the middle value when the values are ordered. 

Mode is the most common single value within the data. 

# Variability / dispersion
This refers to how spread out around the central tendency a dataset is. 
Variance, $S^2$ refers to the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. 
$$ S^2 = \frac{\sum{x_i - \bar{x}}^2}{n-1} $$
[[standard deviation]], $S$, is the square root of the variance. 

$$ S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{x_i - \bar{x}}^2}{n-1}} $$
# Method depending on data type
In nominal data, the **mode** is the central tendency. 
For ordinal data, the **median** is the central tendency. 
For interval data, we can use the **mean** as the central tendency.
