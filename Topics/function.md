# Functions (mathematics)

Not to be confused with [[functions (python)]]. 

# Introduction
A function is a binary relation between two sets that associates each element in set $x$ with exactly one element of a set $y$. 

Basically, the function takes an input $x$, performs some transformation of $x$, and outputs $y=f(x)$. 

# Definition
A plot can be ruled to be a function if it passes the *vertical line test.* If any vertical line passes through exactly one point along the line, then that line is a function. This indicates that each $x$ input results in a single $y$ output. 

The *domain* of a function is the set of all $x$ values, and the *range* or *codomain* is the set of all $y$ values. 

# Varieties
*Linear* functions will appear as a straight line when plotted, while *nonlinear* functions will appear to have curves. 

Very few relationships in the real world are perfectly modeled by a linear function. 

# Data science applications
Function approximation is a big thing in the world of [[data science]]. If the function is linear, we can use [[linear regression]] to approximate it. 

We could use a [[neural network]] for linear or nonlinear functions, since I've heard these referred to as "universal function approximators."
