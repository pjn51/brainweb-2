# Boolean Logic

If we convert a string to a bool, it will be `False` if it's empty, and `True` if it has something in it. This can be useful for verifying a user has entered something in a text-entry box or something. 

The boolean of zero is `False`, and 1 is `True`. 

# Value Comparisons
All comparisons will return a bool. `print(5 > 4)` will return `True`. 

If you try and compare things that have different types, then Python will attempt to convert one of them and then compare. This only works sometimes. 

# Boolean Operations
`And`, `or`, and `not` are examples of boolean operations that we can perform. 

An `or` operator is less restrictive than an `and` operator. These are pretty intuitive for me. 

By combining these operators we can get more in-depth with our logic. 

In order to meet an is condition, the data types of the two objects compared must be the same, and the values need to be equal. For `==`, the data types can be different in some cases. 

# Conditional Logic
At this point, we’re transitioning to practical application of Python. We will start with `if`statements. 

Python is an imperative language. We tell the computer what we want to happen step by step. This is different from a declarative language. In that kind of language, we tell the computer what we want to have happen, but the language itself handles the details of how that will happen. This means that the details of laying out all the logic are important. 

The fundamental logic ingredients are `if`, `else`, and `elif`. We can chain, combine, and nest these to our heart’s content. Using these three logic gates, we can create very complex structures and pathways for our code to go down.
