# Introduction
OpenAI is a company in the [[data science industry]] that I would love to work for one day. They produced GPT-3, and a cool Jukebox project that creates machine-generated music based on a specific style or artist. 

For a cool series of lessons on deep reinforcement learning, see [[Spinning Up as a RL Researcher]].
