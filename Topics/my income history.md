# My income history ðŸ¤‘

# Lucky's Market
During the summer of my freshman year, I went back to Boulder and stocked shelves at Lucky's Market. I think I made something like $11/hr (gross) or $22,880 annually (gross). This job sucked. 

I was around the 23rd percentile for individual income. 

# Metis TA
From May to September of 2021, I was a teaching assistant for [[Metis]]. At this position, I was paid $30 hourly (gross) which came to about $1,000 to $1,500 monthly since it was part-time, for an annual pay of around $21,000 (gross). 

This meant that I was still in the 23rd percentile for individual income nationally. 

# Atos security consultant
In October 2021, I was hired by [[Atos]] for an annual pay of $67,000. This amounted to $32.22 hourly (gross), or about $3,700 monthly (net). 

I rose to the 69th percentile for individual income.

# Overemployment: Atos and Indeed
In May 2022, I was hired by Indeed as a technical analyst. The offer was for a TC of around $92,700 (gross), for a hourly breakdown of $44.57 hourly (gross). Combined with my Atos income, I was making $159,700 annually (gross), or $76.79 hourly (gross). That's $13,300 monthly (gross)!

After tax, this was around $127,000 (estimate). 

This placed me at the 93rd percentile for individual income.
