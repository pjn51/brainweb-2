# Introduction
This is a practice integral to many forms of [[Buddhism]], particularly Theravada and [[Zen]]. It's difficult to define what is exactly meant by "meditation," since the practice varies between and within each tradition that practices it. 

# Meditation and emotion
I think that the [[emotion]] that meditation dives the deepest into is probably [[boredom]] for me. Of course, it would be whatever emotion the meditator is feeling while they meditate, but overall boredom is probably the most common for me. 

# Benefits
[[Responding is preferable to reacting]], and meditation can help with that.

## Mental benefits
Of course, there are mental and emotional benefits to having a strong meditation practice. I've noticed that I'm more easily able to recognize my internal state and account for it before I react to what I'm feeling. 

## Physical benefits
I've heard some things about meditation changing your body's response to stress and some other things. 

# Varieties
In most forms of mediation, an *object of concentration* is used to focus the attention and practice maintaining concentration. However, in Zen meditation, no object of concentration is used.

This object of concentration is most often the breath, but other bodily sensations or a mantra may be used. 

# Risks
The risks of meditation are very under-studied. This [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-dark-knight-of-the-souls/372766/) discusses those who have had long term negative effects from meditation.
