Hello {name}!

I'm Patrick, a member of the Seattle branch of Socialist Revolution. We're a group of revolutionary socialists allied with the International Marxist Tendency. We're organizing in Seattle and 70 other American cities, and the IMT is working in more than 40 countries around the world. 

We believe that it's vitally important that everyone get organized at the local level. Only by training ourselves in the methods of Marxism can we create a force that can add revolutionary clarity to the struggles that the working class is engaging in, and help them in their battles.Â 

If you're interested in getting involved or just want to learn more about our ideas and day-to-day work, please respond and let me know when we can set up a short, 15-minute phone call to talk! There are great ways to get involved at every level of engagement and availability.
