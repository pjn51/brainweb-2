# Minimum Viable Effort
---
This is a concept coined by BJ Fogg, who says that when we want to form a [[habit]], we should emphasize repetition and consistency over effort per action. Therefore, we should find the *minimum viable effort* that will build our habit. For example, if we want to establish a jogging habit, we should seek to run at least 0.1 miles each day. By setting a very low MVE, we can allow ourselves to build up a habit over time. 

Basically, [[Set realistic goals]].
