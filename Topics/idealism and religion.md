# Introduction
I think the intersection and inter-relationship of [[idealism|idealist]] [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] is interesting. 

Does one have to be an idealist to be religious? I would say that the answer is no. One could make the claim that the material world is the basis of reality, and that the material world includes a God or Gods. I'm sure some people thought this way long ago, before science was really capable of investigating this claim.

As the scientific process began to chip away at possible hiding places for this God, it's only natural that religions would retreat into idealism, saying that God must exist on some different plane of reality than the material world. 

In this way, I think religions became idealistic as human civilization developed.
