# Introduction
[[The coefficient of determination reports the proportion of predicted vs actual variance]]. 

The coefficient of determination, or $R^2$ is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predicted by the independent variable. This tells us how well our model is doing in predicting the variance in the target feature. This is one of the important [[metrics]] that we can use during [[modeling]]. 

$R^2$ is one minus [[RMSE]]. 

# Uses
This is one of the important [[metrics]] that we can use during [[modeling]] of [[regression]] tasks.
