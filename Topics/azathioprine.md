This is a [[drugs|medication]] often taken alongside [[remicade]] that works to prevent the body from forming antibodies to remicade. It's usually taken for the first year, as that's when the antibodies usually form. It can cause nausea, so it's important to take it with food. 

The QFC pharmacy bills my insurance $93.49 for each refill, which I had to get every month until I stopped taking it.
