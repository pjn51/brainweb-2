# Negation of the Negation
This is one of the laws of [[dialectics]]. Things change through reaction to the previous state of being. A plant begins as a seed, and then the growth of the sapling negates the being of the seed, and so on. In general, things do not emerge out of thin air - they emerge as a reaction, a negation, of the previous state of affairs. 

A political example is how [[Revolutionary parties tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations]] rather than out of thin air.
