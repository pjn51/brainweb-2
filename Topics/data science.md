Data science is a subfield of computer science that involves creating, adjusting, and deploying [[modeling|models]] and utilizing [[machine learning]] and [[deep learning]] methodologies to gain insights into [[data]] and make predictions. This involves a good deal of [[linear algebra]], [[statistics]], and [[probability]]. Most data scientists use [[Python]] as their language of choice, but some use [[R]]. 

There are a couple questions that come to mind when we talk about data science:
# [[What is the general data science workflow?]]
# [[What do data scientists need to know?]]
