# Deep Learning

## Introduction
Deep learning is a field of [[machine learning]] that includes the [[neural network]] architecture. There are multiple tools within this field, including the [[convolutional neural network]] and the [[recurrent neural network]]. 

The adjective "deep" refers to the fact that multiple layers are usually used in these networks. 

Most modern deep learning models are based on CNNs, where each level learns to transform its input to a slightly more abstract representation. For example, in an image classification problem, the first layer may recieve raw pixels and detect edges, the second layer may take those edges and detect lines and simple shapes, the third may take those shapes and detect noses, eyes, and mouthes, and the final layer may take those inputs and detect faces.
