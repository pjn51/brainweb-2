# Real Estate üè°
---
Real estate is any property that's made up of land and anything on the land. 

Ownership of real estate transfers with the [[property title]], via an [[escrow]] process. 

The real estate sector of the economy is often a site for speculation. For instance, [[China's economy depends on the housing sector]]. 

There are a few [[tax writeoffs]] for property owners.
