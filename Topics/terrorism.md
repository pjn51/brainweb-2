Terrorism is one of the tactics sometimes employed in the service of the workers' movement. It is generally repudiated by Marxists as a pre-revolutionary strategy, but finds support in the theory of some [[Anarchism|anarchists]]. 

> The man who repudiates terrorism in principle - i.e., repudiates measures of supression and intimidation towards determined and armed counter-revolution - must reject all idea of the political supremacy of the working class and its revolutionary dictatorship. 
> -- Trotsky, [[Terrorism and Communism (1920)]]
