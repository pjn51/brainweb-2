# Introduction 
This is the study of structures of experience within [[philosophy]], as experienced from our subjective perspective. Basically it is the study of phenomena, or how things appear to us to be. 

When we talk about phenomena, we aren't trying to look at the world objectively, we're trying to see how the world looks through the eyes of a subjective human being.
