# ESCI 407: Forest Ecology üå≤
`TAGS:`

---
Forest ecology is a subfield of [[environmental science]].

## Introduction
The relationship between climate and GPP is complex. 

A [[biome]] is not a certain collection of species, but ecosystems whose species share certain characteristics or functions, and whose abiotic factors are similar. Two jungle biomes may have totally different species. The two most important abiotic factors are precipitation and temperature. 

The type of vegetation that can grow is dependent on how well and how long the plant can photosynthesize throughout the year

The cohesion-tension mechanism is the way that water moves throughout large plants. Water is released through stomata at the top of the plant (in leaves). Water is absorbed at the base of the plant. This generates a gradient of water concentration from the base to the top of the plant. Water is ‚Äústicky‚Äù and as water is released at the leaves, this draws water from the roots up through the plant. 

Temperature also constrains forest growth at extremes. Walter-Leith climate diagrams compare temperature and precipitation. A 10C temp increase means plants need 20 mm of precip extra to maintain biomass. 

When there isn‚Äôt enough moisture, plants will not grow. When there *is* enough, then plants will begin growing and expanding.

## Tropical rainforest
The precipitation line is well above the temp line all year, meaning the growing season never ends.
This is the highest-productivity ecosystem in the world. Vegetation is abundant and closed-canopy. The soil is very weathered and leached from all the precipitation. 

There‚Äôs no need for dormancy in this system, and most activity is towards the canopy due to the density
Very high level of diversity. It‚Äôs rare for a single species to dominate, whether animal or plant. In Panama, 18,000 beetle species per hectare compared to 24,000 beetle species in North America. 
## Tropical dry forest
- Four to six month growing period
- Level temperature 
- Space between trees, canopies not touching. More light makes it to the floor
- Trees are often drought-deciduous. Trees drop leaves to reduce water loss in summer and sprout new leaves once water returns.

## Tropical savanna
- Fairly stable temperature, water for only 3 months of the year. This doesn‚Äôt allow for woody vegetation to dominate, but there could be a few trees around. Think ‚ÄúLion King‚Äù stuff. 
- Often maintained by fires, grazing, and other mechanisms.
- Temperate forest - [[France]]
	- Temperature varies by 20C, there's enough precip for a year-round growing season. 
	- Tall vegetation, closed canopy. Some light gets to the floor, but that changes seasonally. 
- Temperate forest - [[Seattle]] 
	- Very variable precip level, mild temp variation.
	- There‚Äôs a dry period for about 3 months, but this still produces a closed-canopy forest due to water storage in the soil. However, climate change could lengthen this dry period which would cause changes. 
- Many subtypes of temperate forest exist
- Seasonality of these biomes affect animals. Dietary specialists must have short lifespans to avoid seasonal change, or migrate following the seasons
## Desert
- Temperature is always too high relative to precipitation to allow for growing of woody vegetation. There won‚Äôt be a forest here. 
- 15C temp variation. The only vegetation here will be shrubs and small plants

## Tundra
- High temperature variation, but there is enough precipitation to allow for growing. However, the temperature is too low for photosynthesis, and all the precipitation falls as snow, making the system water-starved despite high precipitation

## Boreal forest / taiga
- Slightly higher temperatures lead to a 5 month growing season here. 
- We see some woody vegetation spaced out here

# Niches
- Niche is basically the conditions an organism needs. A single habitat can have multiple niches.
- Niches are ideas, not places. Describes how and where an organism lives. 
- Abiotic and biotic factors included.
- As resources deplete,life patterns change. Ex: at low water levels, reproduction stops but survival continues.
- There are many dimensions of variable, light x temp x moisture and so on that define a niche.

## Fundamental niche:
- Where an organism could live and grow. An organism may not be able to reach the area, or competition with other species may exclude them from the habitat. 
- The *realized niche*: where an organism actually thrives. Combo of conditions that allow the organism to thrive alongside competition.

## Competition
- If 2 species are truly coexisting, they must have different niches in some way. If their niche was identical, one species would eventually gain the other hand.
- Competition occurs at the intersection of niches. Therefore [[evolution]] favors the movement of species into new and unique niches.

## Resource partitioning
- As competition increases, species begin to divide up resources on a finer scale,either temporally or geographically. Some bird species eat only from the tops of trees and so on. 

## Niches in the forest
- Nitrogen is limiting nutrient. Most Nitrogen is made available through either free living or symbiotic microorganisms. Nitrogen fixing is energy intensive and has to be anoxic. 
- For free living micros, Nitrogen fixation happens mainly on the forest floor, topsoil, and a little bit by micros living on canopy leaves. This is because there's too much oxygen and not enough carbon at high levels in the canopy. 
- Some lichens can fix Nitrogen. They grow on the canopy. Lichens are a host fungus with algae or cyanobacteria inside. - Some cyanobacteria can fix Nitrogen.
- Nitrogen-fixing lichen is common in old growth forest, mainly L. Oregana.

## N fixing in forest succession
- For the first 50 yrs, red alder fixes most N. However, that drops off after 50 yrs, and after 150 yrs the majority of fixed N is fixed by lichens. The gap in between is filled somewhat by fixers in rotting wood. 
- Why don't we find L. oregana in young forests?
	- Some think that there's more light available in mature forests, or that mature forests have a better microclimate, or lichen gets overtopped by a growing forest canopy before it can grow that much. 
- After 100 yrs, L organica becomes a huge player in N fixation. Very few forests in the US reach 100 years old. - Most timberlands are cut from 40 - 75 rotation age.
- This age really changes the N fixation sources. Red alder is the main source from symbiosis. However, red alder is suppressed on commercial timber land. These forests squeak by on the leftover N in the soil and through rotting wood bacteria. 
- Managing red alder is hard. It can't economically grow everywhere. 
## Results of young forest practices
- Managers have turned to N fertilization. Only sites with poor soils or poor productivity are fertilized. 

## Movement of L organica
- After death, the lichen falls to the floor and the N enters the soil. 
- Niche extremes
	- Temperatures in the upper PNW canopy can get really hot in the summer! Like 104F.
	- At high temp, cell membranes can liquify. Bad! 
	- High intensity heat stress is caused by fire. Even low intensity ground fires cause stress. 
	- Some trees are adapted to intense fires with thick bark and dropping of lower branches as the tree grows. This prevents fires from getting to their canopies. They have deep roots that escape fire. 
	- Some species are adapted to promote fire! Some pines are like this because they need fire to reproduce. 

## Low temperatures
- Chilling and freezing pose challenges. Fruits and flowers especially. 
- When it's too cold, membranes lose permeability. At freezing temps, ice crystals damage cells. 
- When temp drops slowly, plants acclimate by producing different compounds. 

# Forests and soils
- Pedogenesis: the formation of new soil

Soils form based on five factors
1. Organisms
2. Topography
3. Time
4. Climate
5. Parent material

- Pedogenesis includes the breakdown of parent rock into sand, silt, and clay. It also includes the accumulation of organic matter 
- Vertical structures develop in the soil in distinct layers. 

## Parent material
- Can be transported by landslide (colluvial), water (alluvial), or wind (aeolian) to the site. 
- Plants obtain their mineral nutrients from the parent rock. Nutrients become available through parent rock weathering. 
- One exception is nitrogen. Nitrogen becomes available through microorganisms that fix the N. 

## Topography / relief
- Soils at the top of a slope usually have fewer nutrients
- Organisms alter soil characteristics in multiple ways. 
- Conifers produce less nutritious leaf litter than other trees. This leads to acidic soil. 
- Podzolization: a process in coniferous regions that basically bleaches the soil. 

## Energy capture
- NPP usually maxes out around 1% of total solar input. 
- Even very productive plant communities can only get to 10% at max.
- GPP is an ecosystem level measure of photosynthesis. 
- Rubisco is the most abundant enzyme on earth. It is used as a carboxylase and an oxygenase, in both the light and dark reactions used by photosynthesis. 
- Plants will allocate different resources to light and dark rxns based on the light level in their environment. 
- There are shade and sun adapted species, and even different types of leaves adapted for specific light conditions. Douglass fir is sun adapted in general, and has both shade and sun adapted leaves. These leaves differ in shape and orientation.  
- Sun leaves are often pointed upward, maximizing sunlight in the morning and afternoon, while minimizing exposure at noon when it's hot. 
- Shade leaves are often horizontal to maximize light absorption in general. 
- We can visualize adaptation to the light environment by looking at the light response curve of a leaf. This shows us how the photosynthetic rate changes as the light level increases. At a certain point, the leaf is maxed out and that tells us what conditions the leaf is adapted to. 
- Leaf area index (LAI) is a way to measure the leaf surface. Needle leaf trees have a head start on LAI because of higher surface area. 
- Leaf nitrogen is a determining factor in photosynthetic capacity. As N increases, so does capacity. Also, more N tends to lead to shorter lived leaves while N-poor environments have longer leaf lifespan because the trees conserve resources more strictly. However, net photosynthesis is lower in leaves of longer lifespan.
