# IsoData clustering
---
IsoData clustering is a [[clustering]] method often used in [[remote sensing]].   We start with all pixels in one class. Then, we fragment the class again and again until there are a lot of classes. We define some measure of uniformness internal to the classes to tell the algo to stop splitting.
