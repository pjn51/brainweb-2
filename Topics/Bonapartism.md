Bonapartism is a situation in which society is in crisis. This causes the [[state]] to be able to temporarily step outside its usual role as the servant of the ruling class in order to maintain class society more forcibly. [[Bonapartists seek to mediate class struggle]]. 

 Bonapartism can arise when the state is being set up, like Napoleon's state which was set up just after the dust had settled from the [[France|French Revolution]]. It can also be something that a state develops *into*, such as the [[Rome|Roman Empire]] under Caesar, [[Germany]] under [[Hitler]], or the [[Russia|USSR]] under [[Stalin]]. 

For example, the state may harshly punish the more despised capitalists and give concessions to the workers more freely, but will also seek to break the organizations of the working class or try and dissolve them into the official state apparatus. [[China]] has elements of this in the behavior of their Communist Party. 

What the Nazis had in Germany was similar to this. Hitler relied on the [[bourgeoisie]] to gain power, but also [[economic planning|nationalized]] whole industries without compensation sometimes. This is why we say that [[fascism]] is a form of Bonapartism.

> "Named after the regime of Napoleon, bonapartism is a form of bourgeois government in crisis. It implies political veering between classes, but is fundamentally based on bourgeois property relations. Proletarian Bonapartism is based instead on state ownership of property."

# Proletarian bonapartism
Proletarian bonapartism defines a state that is bonapartist where the ruling class is the proletariat. The Soviet Union degenerated into such a state, as [[Trotsky]] discusses in [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]]. 

# Military dictatorship
This form of bonapartism is weaker than fascism, and less favorable for [[capitalism]] than bourgeois democracy. There is less of a mass base, and the military itself is the base for the regime, along with foreign capitalists in some cases.
