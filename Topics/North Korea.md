# Introduction
North Korea is a country in East Asia. It is bordered to the south by [[South Korea]] and to the north by [[China]] and [[Russia]]. 

# 1940s
The Korean peninsula was divided between [[Russia|Soviet]] and [[USA|American]] troops after the surrender of [[Japan]] and the end of [[WW2]]. 

The Soviet administration set up a government, and appointed [[Kim Il-sung]] to the position of Chairman of the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea in 1946. 

The DPRK was officially founded in 1948, and Soviet troops withdrew that year. 

# 1950s
Suspecting that [[Syngman Rhee]], the anti-communist leader of [[South Korea]], was planning to invade, [[Kim Il-sung]] and the Soviet ambassador to the DPRK lobbied [[Stalin]] to support a war against the south. 

The [[Korean War]] began in 1950.
