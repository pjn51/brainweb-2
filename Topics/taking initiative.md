# Taking Initiative

I feel like this is the biggest weak spot of my [[How can we model personality?]]. I don't ever really take initiative towards changing anything for the better. That applies mostly to my relationships and my health and routine.

For some reason, I seem to be able to establish good daily routines, but I struggle with the things that can't be broken down into a routine, like being a good partner or maintaining my friendships. 

One approach would be to create routines for those sorts of things, even if that is a little weird. Maybe I should try that and just see how it goes.
