# The Labor Aristocracy

The idea of a labor aristocracy was first put forward by [[Marx]] and [[Engels]].

Some leaders of the [[unions]] and other [[mass organizations]] have a distinct set of interests from the rank-and-file members of those organizations. This is because they have been bought off by the capitalists in exchange for the quieting down and managing of militancy within their organizations. 

This is really only possible during an upswing in [[capitalism]], as the rank-and-file of these organizations need to be shown that cooperation with the bosses can be to their benefit. During periods of decline, there is not enough [[surplus value]] for the bosses to deliver on any promised improvements.

## Are All White Americans Labor Aristocrats?
Some have put forward the flawed idea that the whole of the white working class in the US is part of this labor aristocracy. This is a misunderstanding of the meaning of the term. An example of this outlook is found in [[Settlers - The Mythology of the White Proletariat (1983)]].

They look to the history of the US working class, which was often divided along racial lines, and claim that this shows that the white section of the [[proletariat]] is reactionary, or even that white workers are not proletarian!

This outlook is [[dialectics|undialectical]]. The so-called white working class was easily split from the rest of the proletariat by the ruling class in the past, because the ruling class was in the process of exterminating the native population of North America, and could turn around and allow a segment of the proletariat to share in this surplus in the form of land. 

From this argument, it does NOT follow that white people will never unite with the rest of the working class for all time. There is no more extra surplus for the ruling class to bribe white workers with. Therefore, white workers have revolutionary potential.
