$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)* P(A)}{P(B)}$$
The above equation is saying that the probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ has already happened, or $P(A|B)$, is equal to the probability that event $B$ happens given that event $A$ already happened, multiplied by the probability that event $A$ happens in general, divided by the probability that event $B$ happens in general. 

For example, the probability that you go play basketball when it's raining is equal to the probability that it rains while you play basketball, multiplied by the probability that you go play basketball, divided by the probability that it rains.
