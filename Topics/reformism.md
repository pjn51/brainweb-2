# Introduction
Reformism is the political belief that there is a way forward for society through the normal channels of bourgeois democracy. Reformists seek to moderate the excesses of capitalism through these institutions. 

Functionally, reformism acts as one of the main obstacles to revolution, since it has the ability to peel away layers of the working class and demobilize them. 

# Reformism and social democracy
I've directed the phrase "Social Democracy" to lead here, since the forces of social democracy betrayed revolutionary internationalism at the beginning of [[WW1]], choosing to side with their national [[bourgeoisie]]. 

However, sometimes the phrase "social democracy" is used to refer to the workers movement, especially before the events noted above. Back then, it was thought that the workers movement and the movement for social democracy were one and the same. 

# The relationship of reformism to economic cycles
During an upswing in [[capitalism]], the increased profits of the capitalist allow for the expansion of benefits for the working class. The seemingly successful strategy of asking the capitalists for reforms can build up currents of reformism in the workers' movement.

The leaders of the mass organizations can be bought off by the capitalists, becoming members of the [[labor aristocracy]]. They gain a higher standard of living in exchange for becoming "the labor lieutenants of [[capital]]" within the workers movement. 

On the other hand, during downswings in capitalism, no reforms will be given to the workers. In fact, the capitalists will seek to take back gains previously given to the workers during the previous upswing. This will expose the failure of reformism to many workers.
