Native to tropical Cameroon, where the natural environment is hot, humid, with frequent gentle rain. Their large leaves need lots of sunlight. 

# Light Preferences
This plant needs more light than others because of its huge leaves. Put it right near the window. 

# Water Preferences
Water whenever the soil dries out. This rate will depend on conditions in your house, but a benchmark would be **every 1-2 weeks**. Water with **1/4 to 1/3 of the pot's volume** so that you can saturate the soil but not drown the roots.

Leaves dropping | Many things lol. This is a very sensitive plant
