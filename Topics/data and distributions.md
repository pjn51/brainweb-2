# Data and Distributions
---

There are two kinds of data, qualitative data and quantitative data. 

[[Data can be quantiative or qualitative]].

## Qualitative data
[[Qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal]]. 


## Quantitative data
[[Quantitative data can be discrete or continuous]].

## Graphing data
[[Data can be visualized graphically]]. 

There are multiple ways to visualize data, and the best choice depends on which type of data you are working with. 

## Distributions
We can contrast actually-existing probability distributions with theoretical distributions, which don’t really exist but probability distributions often approach theoretical ones.

### Common theoretical probability distributions
**[[normal distribution]]** is the most common one. It’s the bell curve, also called the Gaussian distribution. As datasets expand, their distributions approach the normal distribution. They can be used best for continuous quantitative data. 

Characterised by mean and variance about the mean. 
A standard normal distribution is centered around zero and has a dispersion of 1

The **binomial distribution** describes data that comes from repeated Bernoulli Trials, (experiments that return either 1 or 0 as the only possible result). 

Characterized by number of trials and probability of success. 
The uniform distribution describes data where each outcome has an equal probability. Characterized by the right and left bounds of the data. 

The **exponential distribution** typically describes the time between events happening. Characterized by rate alone. Basically, as time advances, the probability of an event happening increases in an exponential fashion until we are absolutely certain it will have happened by a certain point. We can use this to predict when people will arrive at a hospital or a store, when cars will pass by your house, and other sorts of things. 

## Code applications
We can use `np.random.normal( )` to generate a random group of numbers that have a normal distribution. 

## Bivariate data
So far, we’ve just been analyzing one variable at a time. It’s common to have multiple series of data that we want to compare. 
Bivariate data is data from two variables, with each value from each variable is paired up with the other variable.
