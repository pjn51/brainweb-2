# A Marxist Analysis of K-Pop

## What is K-pop?
Developed in [[South Korea]] in the 90s and 2000s, K-pop refers to the highly bureaucratized and centralized manufacturing of pop stars and musical groups. These artists are trained in singing, dancing, and choreography in academies from a very early age, and are tied into virtual slave-contracts for their entire career. 

## Overview of my analysis
I see themes from [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]], as well as the theory of combined and uneven development from [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] at play in the development of K-pop. 

[[USA|America]], being the dominant capitalist power, basically rebuilt post-war South Korea in its image, but instead of having the long development of [[USA|American]] [[capitalism]], which built lots of contradictions and complexity into the system, the Korean system of capitalism came about on a much higher basis. 

Because of this, South Korea is kind of a more "pure" system than America could institute in its own country. Workers have fewer rights, and monopolies dominate the economy to an even higher degree than they do in the US. 

## Where does K-pop fit into this?
K-Pop emerged on this basis. While the American music industry played catch-up with the development of organic cultural figures in the post-war era, the Korean music industry was the result of direct investment on the part of giant firms and the state. 

Performers, known as "stars," are trained by these conglomerates from adolescence up through their entire career. This is done based on the very high technique of modern capitalism, which the basis for not only Korean, but also the Japanese economy. 

## More American than America
Because the American bourgeoisie was able to set up the Korean state with little resistance from the war-crushed population, and with literally no accountability from that population or anyone else, they were able to set up a state that they could only dream of at home. 

On this basis, the Korean music industry is more nakedly transactional than the US industry could ever be. With no history of unionization in the industry, and with agressive state and conglomerate investment, the small country is able to compete globally in terms of entertainment.
