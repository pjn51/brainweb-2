Maoism is the revolutionary legacy of [[Mao]]'s thought. There is also something called Mao Zedong Thought, which I don't know anything about. 

## Third Worldism
This is an idea within Maoism that claims that there is no longer any [[proletariat]] to be found in the advanced capitalist countries. For instance, third worldists would claim that white Americans are disqualified from being members of the proletariat, along with white Europeans. 

My critique of this is that it lacks a deep understanding of the tactics that the ruling class does use to split the working class, and when these tactics can be used. Racism is not the fault of the white working class, but is a tactic used by the capitalists to divide the workers. [[White workers don't benefit from racism]] and [[First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism]]. 

Ironically, leftists who say that the movement must exclude white workers are doing a service to the capitalists in the same way that racism functions to erode working class solidarity and class [[class consciousness]]. 

Instead of combating these tactics of division, third-worldism falls deeply into them. A revolutionary movement based on third worldist ideas would never be able to generate the international connections needed for success. The working class is naturally internationalist, but I doubt European and [[USA|American]] workers would strike in support of a movement that classified all of them as bourgeois. [[Internationalism is essential to the workers' movement]]. 

## Maoism and the Peasantry
Driven from the cities by the policy of [[opportunism#Class collaborationism|class collaborationism]] with the [[Kuomintang]], the [[CPC]] was forced to base itself totally in the [[peasantry]]. This led to the Maoist theories relating to the revolutionary potential of that group.
