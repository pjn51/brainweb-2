# The Asiatic Mode of Production
---
The Asiatic mode of production is one of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[stages of historical development]]. The main features of this stage are an urban society reliant on an agricultural base, public works centering on irrigation, a despotic system of monarchical government often relying on religious characteristics, a large bureaucracy, exploitation based on taxation, and [[state]] ownership of land. 

[[Marx]] theorized this with the example of [[India]] in the 1850s, noting the absence of private land ownership combined with despotic rule by an urban clique. These societies didn't have much [[commodities|commodity]] production. 

The AMP is the most disputed mode of production in Marxist theory, and Marx dropped it as a concept in his later works. In the [[Russia|USSR]] in the 1930s, the theory was suppressed and its supporters were labled [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]].
