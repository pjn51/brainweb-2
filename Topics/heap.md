# Heap
A heap, or priority queue, is a data type where elements have a certain *priority* and those with higher priority are served first. 

A *min heap* has the minimum element at the root of the tree, and the *max heap* is the inverse. The rest of the heap is an *unsorted tree.* 

The [[complexity]] of this method is $\log(n)$ at most, and getting the highest priority element can be done in constant time.
