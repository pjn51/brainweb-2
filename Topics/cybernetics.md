# Introduction
Cybernetics is an approach to understanding *purposive* (goal-oriented) systems , especially those with [[feedback loops]] between input and output. It was founded in 1948 by the engineer Norbert Wiener. 

# Basic ideas
The central focus of cybernetics is to understand how systems (particularly systems that have goals) process information, react to that information, and change their actions. 

This field models systems as having circular causal chains. Systems move from action, to sensing, to comparison with the desired goal, and then back to a modified action. 

## Control loops and feedback
To have *control,* we need to be able to manipulate information passing through a system. There are two kinds of control information: *feedforward* (the information that instructs a mechanism or process on what needs to be done) and *feedback* (information coming back from that mechanism or process and reporting how things are going).

These two kinds of information can circulate in what is known as a *control loop*. A control loop is a mechanism for detecting change, and taking appropriate corrective action. Control [[loops]] often have a few common features:

*Standard setting:* the setting at which a planned action is initiated. This sets the standard that future information will be compared to. For example, in a thermostat, the standard setting is whatever temperature the thermostat is set at by the dial. The unit which stores this standard is called the *comparator.*

*Output monitoring:* the system needs to have some ability to measure the output of the system. The unit which performs this function is called the *sensor.* The sensor provides feedback information.

*Comparison:* the system must compare actual performance with the required performance that has been determined by the standard setting. This process takes place in the comparator, and sends an error signal that shows the deviation from desired performance. 

*Hunting:* this is an inability of the system to maintain desired performance. It is a state where output "pulsates" above and below the desired target, as the system seeks the optimal action. This often happens because there is some lag in the reporting of an error after conditions have changed. Therefore, the corrective action will always come slightly too late, and may overshoot the needed adjustment, resulting in a new error that takes time to report and correct for. 

# In economics
Project Cybersyn attempted to theorize a cybernetically controlled economy in the 1970s. 

Various Soviet economists were involved in trying to implement principles of cybernetics and computer assisted economic planning in the [[Russia|USSR]] in the 60s, but by the time that computers made these efforts viable in the 80s, the USSR was moving towards market reform. 

Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell proposed a cybernetic-assisted [[socialism]] in their essay *Towards a New Socialism* in 1995. 

Alternatively, Hayek theorized that cybernetics could help economists understand "self-organizing or self-generating systems" that he defined as "markets." Hayek also considered Adam Smith's idea of the "invisible hand" as a premonition of the role of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics.
