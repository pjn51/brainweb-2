# Feedback Loops 🔁

# Introduction
The concept of feedback loops has a place in [[environmental science]] as well as [[cybernetics]]. A feedback loop is a circular path of action -> reaction. 

# In environmental science
In the environment, there are negative and positive feedback loops. 

## Negative feedback loops
These are feedback loops that lead to a negation of the conditions that started the action. For example, in an [[ecosystem]], if more food enters the system, the life expectancy of young organisms may increase, which decreases the availability of food in an ecosystem, returning the system to a balanced state.

## Positive feedback loops
These are feedback loops where the reaction to altered conditions leads to an exacerbation of the situation that incited the reaction. For example, as the Earth's temperature increases, sea ice melts, revealing more seawater. Seawater has a lower albedo than sea ice, further accelerating warming of the Earth.
