# Jungle Velvet Variety
This is a different variety of calathea that requires different care. It has a reputation for being tempermental. 

## Light Preferences
**Bright, indirect light** is needed. The minimum is enough light to read a book in. 

## Water Preferences
This variety prefers **consistent soil moisture** and will punish you if you mess this up. It's hard to create a schedule, and the leaves aren't a good indicator of when the plant needs water. 

Water early in the day to avoid letting the plant be soggy overnight. 

During the winter, lower the moisture, but don't let the soil dry out completely. 

## Soil Preferences
Well draining mix. A good option is 2/3 peat or choir and 1/3 perlite. 

## Other Needs
This variety requires high [[humidity]], with 50% being the minimum for healthy leaves.
