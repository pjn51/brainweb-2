# The Proletariat

The proletariat, or the working class, is the class in capitalist society that has nothing to sell but its [[labor]] power. The most determined and class conscious members of the proletariat comprise the [[vanguard]] of the class. 

[[Capitalism organizes the working class]], starting when [[Primitive accumulation separated producers from means of production]]. 

These outcasts were eventually pulled to the cities, where they could find work. This contributed to the rise of the urban centers during the Industrial Revolution. [[Primitive accumulation kickstarted urbanization]]. 

[[Every class has interests]] that determine how the class acts politically *on average.* Just as it is in the bourgeoisie's interest to pay their workers as little as possible and to sell their goods for as much as possible, it is in the workers' interests to be paid as much as possible for their work. 

From this initial premise, we can track the development of the workers' movement. [[The workers' movement develops through struggle]], from individual struggle to workplace struggle to political struggle. 

As we know, [[Few relationships are truly linear]]. The workers movement tends to have upswings and downswings, tied to the cycles of [[capitalism]]. [[In depressions, workers tend to avoid confrontation]], waiting to fight back until they have leverage.

However, the workers can only stay furious for so long. After a while, especially if some demands have been met, they will return to their lives. [[Proletarian leaders become subject to alien class forces]]. Since the militancy has died down within these organizations, and [[Reforms are only possible during economic upswing|the upswing in capitalism allows for some reforms to be made]], these new leaders begin to lean on the ruling class to maintain popularity. Despite their words, these leaders have more in common with the ruling class than with the workers. They are members of the [[labor aristocracy]]. 

Like a tsunami, the class struggle surges forward, and then recedes. In its wake, it leaves a hardened crust in the form of the organizations that served as the tools for the militant workers. As the workers leave these shells, they begin to rot from the insides in the hands of these labor aristocrats and the bureaucrats who serve them. 

This means that far from being able to pick up where they left off, during each upsurge the workers must face off against these so-called "leaders," and replace them with a newly formed layer of militant working class leadership. In upswings, [[Institutional leadership reflects the prior period's mood]].
