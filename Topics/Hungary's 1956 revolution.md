# Hungary's 1956 revolution
---
The [[proletariat|workers]] and youth of [[Hungary]] rose up against [[Russia|Soviet]] occupation in 1956. They were defeated by Soviet troops that invaded to restore order. 

[[Ted Grant]] argues that this was a genuine revolutionary effort made by the workers and youth to throw off the yoke of bureaucratic rule, and that the characterization of this movement as [[fascism|fascist]] was slander. He cites a declaration from the Central Workers' Council of Budapest that states unwavering allegiance to collective property and [[socialism]].
