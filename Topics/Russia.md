## 1905
Up to 1905, the Russian workers movement had a lot of internal turmoil. There had been a largely [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement called [[Narodniks]] who had failed to make a dent in the Tsar's state. 

In 1905, the newly born Russian [[proletariat]] rose up for the first time in a confused way. Soviets were created spontaneously for the first time, and Lenin called this revolution a 'dress rehersal' for what was to come. **

## February 1917
In Febuary 1917, the Tsar's regime fell, ending hundreds of years of Romanov rule. However, this was a broadly bourgeois revolution. Promising to oversee a Constituent Assembly at a future point, a Provisional Government established itself.

## October 1917
The Russian revolution of October 1917 was the first and so far only successful workers' revolution, in which the proletariat seized state power. 

There were many factions in the Russian workers' movement. 
- [[Bolsheviks]]
- [[Mensheviks]]
- [[Socialist Revolutionaries]]

## 1991
The USSR collapsed, and Russia became an independent, capitalist state again.
