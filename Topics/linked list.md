# Linked List
Within linked lists, [[data]] are packaged into nodes that hold the [[data]] and a pointer that points to the next node. This allows for a flexible length, unlike an [[array]]. 

The doubly linked list has nodes that contain pointers to the next array *and the previous one.*

We can add new nodes in constant time, but [[Linked lists have downsides]]. This is why [[Most programming languages use dynamically sized arrays]].
