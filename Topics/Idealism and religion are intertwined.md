# Idealism and religion are intertwined. 
Does one have to be an [[idealism|idealist]] to be [[religion|religious]]? I would say that the answer is no. One could make the claim that the [[Matter, not idea, is fundamental]], and that the material world includes a god or gods. I'm sure some people thought this way long ago, before science was really capable of investigating this claim.

However, idealism requires some degree of mysticism, usually founded in a belief in god, and [[Religion hides behind idealism]] to evade the [[scientific method]].
