# Fear

Fear is an [[emotion]]. I've mentioned fear in a political and historical context, but here I want to discuss it in more of a personal way.

We feel fear when our subconscious is telling us that we should avoid whatever situation we're in. Because of this, fear can be a useful tool for risk assessment.
