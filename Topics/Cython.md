# Introduction
Cython is a [[programming language]] that aims to combine the speeds of [[C]] with the ease-of-use found using [[Python]]. 

Python libraries like [[Pandas]] and [[NumPy]] use Cython functionality to deliver their speedy peformance.

# Design
Cython works by passing the code written in python to C for execution, and then back to python for the output.
