All schools of Buddhism share some common ideas. They all follow the teachings of [[Buddha]], they all uphold the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Eightfold Path]]. 

Theravada was the earlier school, originating in India, while Mayahana, or the "Greater Vehicle," is the school of Buddhism that spread into [[China]] and Central Asia. 

[[Zen|Zen]] buddhism is a subset of the Mayahana school, and is mainly practiced in East Asia. It originated when Bodhidharma traveled from India to [[China]].
