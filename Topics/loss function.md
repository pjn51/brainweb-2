# Loss Function

## Introduction
The loss function of a [[machine learning]] [[modeling|model]] is used to "grade" how well the model is performing its task. We can use this [[function]] to perform [[gradient descent]] and iteratively improve the model. 

## Additions to the loss function
We can guard against overfitting by adding a [[regularization]] term to the loss function.
