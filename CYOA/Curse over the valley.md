# Curse over the valley
---
Ever since you were a child, your parents warned you about the castle that sits over the valley. As you grew older, you grew tired of the same old tales of goblins and vampires. 

On the day your life changed forever, you were busy tending crops for the harvest, when it became unseasonably cold. As your returned home, you nearly collapsed as you saw your modest home ablaze, your whole family murdered.

That was one year ago, and it's the reason you stand in the village, your last gold coins in your hand and a sword on your back. There's only one who could have killed your family, and it's up in that cursed castle.

First things first, you have a decision to make. The castle is a ways off, so a horse would be nice. On the other hand, you might want to spend your gold on some holy water to aid in the fight ahead.
