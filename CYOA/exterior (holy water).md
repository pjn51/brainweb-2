# 🏰 Arrival at the castle
---
The sun is beginning to set as you reach your infernal destination. You've grown more and more nervous as the trail nears the blackened walls of the castle. Walking took a while, and it's nearly dark out.

Seeing the castle for the first time sends chills down your spine, and you can see why the villagers have never mounted an attack on this place. An army couldn't batter down these gates, but oddly enough, every post and battlement seems totally deserted. The only sound you can hear is the wind through the trees.

Your mind reluctantly turns to entering this fortress. You spy a dark crack in the stone foundation that might lead deeper into the castle. You could try climbing to the nearest window. It's pretty high though, and the long walk has tired you out.
