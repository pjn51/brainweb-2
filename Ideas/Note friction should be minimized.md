*Note friction should be minimized.* In my [[PKM]] system, I want to minimize the barrier to entry for new ideas to enter the web. This friction prevents organic development of my brainweb. 

A web of *topics* has more friction than a web of *ideas.* Topics make it harder for me to just pop a note out for everything that comes into my head, which would be cool. I've overcome this limitation by having topics *and* ideas in this web.
