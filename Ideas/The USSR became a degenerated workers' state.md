*The USSR became a degenerated [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]].* After [[Stalin]] and the bureaucracy triumphed, the [[state]] began to serve the interests of this new bureaucracy rather than the [[proletariat]]. However, [[The USSR wasn't state capitalist]], and [[The USSR wasn't bureaucratic collectivist]]. 

[[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]], albeit a degenerated one, and I agree. He said this because, as we know, [[States are instruments of class domination]]. He didn't classify the bureaucracy as a new class formation, and said that therefore the ruling class in Soviet society was still the proletariat. It was the *degeneration* of this situation which allowed the bureaucracy to exert its independent will, leading to a situation of proletarian bonapartism.
