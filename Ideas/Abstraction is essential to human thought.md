# Abstraction is essential to human thought.
We create mental models of the world, and then by trying to make predictions with these mental models, and comparing our predictions to the results we see, we gradually improve our understanding of the world. Because these models are based only on past events, [[Human consciousness is conservative]]. This is why we say that [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]]. 

In a way, [[Machine learning is the process of developing abstractions]] using a computer.  

However, we ought to remember that [[Nothing exists outside its context]], and 
There are limits to the usefulness of abstraction. First of all, [[Nothing exists outside its context]], so the applicability of abstractions are limited (therefore [[Idea notes must be scoped]]). Also, [[Action verifies perception]], so abstraction without experimentation is useless.
