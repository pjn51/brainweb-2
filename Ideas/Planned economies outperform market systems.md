# Planned economies outperform market systems.
We can see in the case of the [[Russia|USSR]] that nationalization and [[economic planning]] is a huge advantage over the use of a market economy. [[Soviet economic growth was unprecedented]] and [[Soviet WW2 victory vindicated the planned economy]]. 

Furthermore, they did all this with no inflation, no unemployment, no homelessness, and no meaningful national debt. It was really just the failure of the bureaucracy running the system that caused the collapse of the country. 

This is further supported by the fact that [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]], which a fully-planned economy makes vastly more efficient and effective. 

[[Alan Woods]] discusses this in the introduction to [[Russia - From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (1997)]]. 

Putting material evidence to the side, we can also develop a philisophical arguement for central planning. If we agree that [[Things change through contradiction]], we can also claim that [[Social production contradicts private ownership]], and this incompatibility constitutes the central contradiction of society under [[capitalism]]. Since [[Contradictions trend towards resolution]], we can expect that either the social nature of production will collapse, or that the private appropriation of profit will.
