# Marx criticized Lassalle. 
This criticism came on at least two fronts: the [[state]] and [[wages]]. 

[[Marx]] viewed the state as [[States are instruments of class domination|an instrument of class domination]], while [[Lassalle viewed the state as arbitrator]]. This is an important distinction, because it determines whether or not [[The workers must build their own state]]. 

Marx argued that while [[Social reproduction costs determines the minimum price of labor power]], [[The social wage flows from class struggle]]. [[Lassalle]] argued otherwise: [[Lassalle coined the Iron Law of Wages]] to describe the supposed inevitability of subsistence wages.
