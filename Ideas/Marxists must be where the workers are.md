*Marxists must be where the workers are.* [[Marxism|Marxists]] must stand alongside the [[proletariat|workers]] as they go through struggle, constantly explaining the correct way out of the crisis of [[capitalism]]. Only by doing this can we dispel the workers' illusions in [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and [[reformism|reformist]] institutions. 

This is opposite to the methods of [[ultraleftism]] and [[sectarianism]], where we stand apart from the working class and demand that they come to the correct conclusions on their own, leaving their [[mass organizations]] and joining small groups on the fringe. 

This applies both metaphorically ([[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]]) and literally, since [[Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis]]. 

This is supported by many thinkers. [[Marx and Engels argued for the integration of Communists into the working class]].
