# Collaborationism doomed China's 1927 revolution. 
The [[CPC]] mishandled the situation and choose to back the [[Kuomintang]] and itâ€™s [[class independence|class collaborationist]] ideas. This gave [[Chiang Kai-Shek]] an opportunity to massacre Communists and workers in 1927, ending the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary organization of the working class. 

This is a perfect example of how [[The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s]]. 

Due to the total isolation of the CPC from the [[proletariat]], they were forced to turn to the [[peasantry]]. In this way, [[Maoism was a product of proletarian defeat]]. Defying great odds, [[The CPC led the peasants to victory in 1949]].
