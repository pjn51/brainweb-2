# There are multiple ways to share a property title. 
When purchasing property with a co-owner, there are a few ways to take on the [[property title|title]]. You can do *joint tenancy,* *community property,* or *tenants-in-common.*

With a **joint tenancy**, an automatic right of survivorship applies. This means that if owner A dies, owner B automatically gets owner A's share. One restriction is that joint tenancy requires *equal* ownership of the property. This setup gives a tax break in the case of an owner's death in the form of waiving capital gains tax on the ownership share of the deceased, from the time of purchase up to the time of their death. 

A **community property** setup is only available to married couples. As opposed to joint tenancy, this allows an owner to will their share to someone else, overriding the right of survivorship. This gives an even better tax break, waiving *all* capital gains tax in the event of one owner's death, from the time of purchase up to the time of death. 

A **tenants-in-common** arrangement doesn't come with the tax advantages or automatic survivorship, meaning that individual owners can will their share to anyone. The flip side of this is that without a will, the ownership share will go into probate in the event of death without a will.
