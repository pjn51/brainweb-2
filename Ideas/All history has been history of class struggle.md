*All history has been history of class struggle.* Up until now, all of human history has been defined and framed by class struggle. We can see this through all of the [[stages of historical development]] that humanity has undergone, from [[primitive communism]] up until modern [[capitalism]].

We can see how [[Things change through contradiction]] by examining the fact that human civilization has changed forms through revolution, when the ascendant class displaces the old ruling class that is no longer progressive 
([[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]])

This idea was first put forward in the [[The Communist Manifesto (1848)]], but it's important to note that [[Marx]] said all *hitherto* history, not all history for all eternity. I think that [[Class society will be seen as human prehistory]], and there will come a time when class struggle doesn't define our history.
