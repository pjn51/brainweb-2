*Religion is the opium of the people.* In a world where good people suffer while the evil prosper, a contradiction develops between the terrible world we see around us and the good world that we believe ought to exist. 

In order to repair this, we develop abstractions that explain that there is some other world in which we will be rewarded for our suffering, and those who exploit us will be punished. 

Because this is an inherently revolutionary urge, [[Religious movements tend to start as revolutionary and end as repressive]] as they are appropriated by the ruling class. 

Fundamentally, religion begins to play a negative role in the consciousness of the masses, since it dissuades us from taking immediate action to make the world a better place. Therefore, [[Marxism|Marxists]] must fight against religious ideas in the [[proletariat|working class]], since [[Marxists must fight against alien class ideas]] in general. Furthermore, [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]], and religious sentiment acts as a brake on rational, conscious activity.
