*China's economy depends on the housing sector.* The [[China|Chinese]] economy is heavily reliant on the profits generated by the contstruction and sale of new housing. 

The real estate industry represents about 20% of the Chinese economy. [^1] This number is higher than in other countries because it is comparatively harder to invest in the stock market in China, and therefore the primary speculative asset for the [[bourgeoisie]] becomes housing.
