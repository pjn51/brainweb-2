*Legacy authentication is often compromise.* Legacy authentication refers to any protocol that doesn't support [[MFA]]. 

Because bad actors often want to gain access to accounts while avoiding MFA, they will use legacy authentication as a workaround. 

If I see an account that doesn't often see legacy activity as part of [[My Atos workflow]], that's a very suspicious indicator of compromise.
