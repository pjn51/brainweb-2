*Capitalism contains the seeds of socialist development.* Of course, a revolution will be required to overturn the fossilized property relations that hold society back under [[capitalism]]. However, we can see glimpses of [[socialism|socialist]] development even under capitalism. 

For example, [[Capitalism spurs automation]]. This automation is a tool of the domination of the [[proletariat]] under capitalism, but eventually [[Socialism will increase leisure time]] using this technology. 

Also, [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning]] that is a grasping and incomplete attempt to escape the insanity of the market. This is because [[Planned economies outperform market systems]]. 

This contradictory process exists because [[Social production contradicts private ownership]], and represent an attempt to overcome the fact that [[Capitalism has fatal limits]]. 

[[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]] and welds together the [[proletariat]]. However, in some industries, [[Deindustrialization has begun to disorganize some sectors of the proletariat]].
