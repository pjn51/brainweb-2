*Niche affects species distribution.* The material facts of nature such as the flow of nutrients and the availability of light create opportunities for various life strategies to be viable. As these factors change, some species die out while new ones speciate from the old. [[There are four modes of speciation]]. 

This idea is explained in [[Ecology - A Very Short Introduction (2020)]].
