# Do your own thinking.
While it's totally okay and actually necessary to understand the ideas of others in order to make novel insights ([[It's ok to be derivative]]), at the end of the day new ideas come from me thinking for myself and moving beyond the lines of thought of others, or adapting their reasoning to new contexts ([[New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic]]). 

This is part of the answer to the question of [[How should I treat others' ideas in my notes?]]
