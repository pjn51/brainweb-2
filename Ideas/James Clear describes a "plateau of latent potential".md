*James Clear describes a "plateau of latent potential".* In his book, [[Atomic Habits (2018)]], he applies the law that [[Quantity transforms into quality]] to the results of good habits.

He says that we must establish habits long enough to reach the tipping point where we can actually see results. He quotes Jacob Riis:

> When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know that it was not the last blow that did it - but all that had gone before.

James Clear calls this period of putting in work without seeing results "the plateau of latent potential." 

In a way, this begins to answer the question: [[How can we apply dialectics to habit formation?]]
