# In depressions, workers tend to avoid confrontation. 
During economic downturn, [[proletariat|workers]] tend to be afraid to speak up or organize [[unions]] for a fear of losing their jobs. After the crisis has passed, the workers remember their sacrifices and tend to take a more militant line. 

We can see this in the low strike rates during the Great Depression compared to the massive union wave afterwards, as well as the delayed unionization wave coming out of the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.
