*Some species are bio-indicators.* Some species are more sensitive to their environments than others are. Amphibians are such a species because they live in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, they absorb chemicals easily through their skin and eggs, and they tend to remain in the same place for their lifetimes. 

These species function as a "canary in the coal mine" when it comes to pollution in their areas. Scientists can monitor the health of these populations in order to get insight into the overall health of the ecosystems in which these species live.

Incedentally, we've seen a massive decline in the health and robustness of amphibian populations worldwide, even those in "pristine areas" ([[There is no wilderness]]). Effects of civilization are reaching the entire ecosystem. This is one indicator that [[We've entered a crisis of biodiversity]].
