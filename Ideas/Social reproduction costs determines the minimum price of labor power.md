# Social reproduction costs determines the minimum price of labor power.
In order to maintain the social production system, the [[bourgeoisie]] must pay the [[proletariat]] enough to survive and raise the next generation of workers. 

The average cost of social reproduction determines the minimum price of labor power, or the minimum wage. 

Note that this is not the average or prevailing wage in most cases, because[[The social wage flows from class struggle]], not from the bare necessities of survival.
