*Ultraleftism is the penalty for opportunism in the workers' movement.* If the workers witness an [[opportunism|opportunist]] leadership, some among them will draw the understandable, but incorrect, conclusions and move in an [[ultraleftism|ultraleft]] direction. 

This just reinforces the fact that [[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]], where we must build on the correct aspects of the conclusions that workers have drawn, while dispelling illusions and correcting misconceptions.

One example is that of "PMC" theorists, who see the failure of some workers to come to revolutionary conclusions (with no small part played by the opportunist leadership of the class) as a permanent indictment of those sections of the class ([[The PMC isn't a real class]]).
