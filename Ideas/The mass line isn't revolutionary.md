*The mass line isn't revolutionary.* [[Mao proposed the mass line]], and while it sounds great to take the desires of the workers and peasants into account when formulating demands, the mass line tactic contains an element of populism, [[opportunism]], and tailism. [[Marxists shouldn't tail-end the movement]]! 

By passively accepting and repeating the existing demands of the masses, the vanguard cedes its role as *leader* of the advanced layers of the masses. It is the role of the vanguard and the Communists to win the masses to a socialist program, not to parrot the existing goals of the workers. 

Instead, [[Marxists should use positive demands]] and transitional demands. [[Transitional demands bridge reform and revolution]].
