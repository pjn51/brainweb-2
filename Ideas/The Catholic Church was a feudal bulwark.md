*The Catholic Church was a feudal bulwark.* It codified and altered the texts of [[Christianity]] in such a way as to protect the property relations of [[feudalism]]. 

In his essay, [[On Historical Materialism (1892)]], [[Engels]] says that it "surrounded feudal institutions with a halo of divine consecration." To him, this explained how the early risings of the European [[bourgeoisie]] were compelled to don a cloak of religion in order to directly challenge the rule of the most powerful feudal lord, the Church (he notes that the Church held 30% of land in Europe at the time).

However, [[Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces]] and the power of the Church was helpless to defend the decaying aristocracy from the rising capitalist class.
