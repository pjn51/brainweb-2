# [[Spinoza]] viewed God as universal.
He said that God was "a substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence" [1].  

This got him into some trouble with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, as well as the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]]. They viewed this idea as dangerously close to atheism, perhaps unconsciously understanding that [[Opposites require each other]] and declaring God as universal was functionally the same as declaring God as false.
