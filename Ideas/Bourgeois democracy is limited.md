# Bourgeois democracy is limited. 
While [[Capitalists prefer liberal democracy]], this is of a fundamentally limited variety. Lenin argues that the various restrictions on participation, which seem trivial to the bourgeoisie, in aggregate, limit the engagement of the average worker in the political system, weighting the electoral system in favor of the rich [1]. 

Especially in a constitutional system, where there are clear boundaries for the legislature. Even with complete legislative control, the working class would be blocked from expropriating the [[bourgeoisie]].
