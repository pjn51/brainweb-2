*Revolutionaries, to Lenin, must be tribunes of the people.* [[Lenin]] says this in [[What is to be Done (1902)]]. A tribune is a representative of somebody's interests, who defends them. 

Lenin meant that the socialists must be seen by the [[proletariat|workers]] as the people who are fighting for their interests. In doing so, the socialists can win the support of the working class and truly act as a [[vanguard]].
