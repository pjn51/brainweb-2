# Build scaffolding, not cages.
When it comes to [[PKM]], I want my system to reduce as much friction as possible ([[Note friction should be minimized]]) while remaining as simple as possible ([[Complexity must be justified]]). 

This means that systems should allow my ideas to grow around and through them, not constrain me.
