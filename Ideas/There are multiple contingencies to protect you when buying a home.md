# There are multiple contingencies to protect you when buying a home.
A contingency is a way out of the deal after you submit an offer. This is important because [[A housing offer is a binding contract]].  

In a situation where you're performing an inspection, you have an inspection contingency allowing you to back out if you don't like the results of the inspection. 

Since [[The bank has a say about your housing offer]], there's a financing contingency that allows you to exit the deal if the loan falls through. Similarily, an appraisal contingency allows you to back out if the bank's appraiser finds the home is worth a different value than the sale price. You can make the financing contingency as objective or subjective as you want, meaning that you can write out all the conditions the loan has to meet in order for you to go ahead with the purchase, or you can just say that the loan must be "acceptable" in your judgement (see p. 292 of the housing guide we got from the library). 

There's an appriasal contingency, which can be waived via an appraisal gap clause. [[Appraisal gaps can make your offer more competitive]]. 

A title contingency allows the buyer to go and see if there are any liens on the house, since [[Liens transfer with the property title]].
