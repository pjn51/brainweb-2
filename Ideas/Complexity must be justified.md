*Complexity must be justified.* We should only introduce complexity to our techniques and [[data science]] workflows if absolutely necessary for the use-case. 

It's much better to solve the problem in a simple way than in a complex way, especially if we're speaking about computational [[complexity]] literally. Even if we aren't, simple is best. 

In good data science projects, where we've started with a problem to solve ([[Begin projects with a use-case]]), we can optimize for the solution to to the problem in the most simple way. 

In a personal sense, complexity should also be justified. Keep it simple, stupid!
