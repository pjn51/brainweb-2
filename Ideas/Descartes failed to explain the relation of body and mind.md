*Descartes failed to explain the relation of body and mind.* Instead of resolving the duality of mind and body, [[Descartes]] fell into [[idealism]], further reifying this false divide. 

From a [[materialism|materialist]] perspective, [[Thought is matter that thinks]], resolving this divide. 

Later, [[Spinoza resolved the mind-body dualism]] into a monism of Substance.
