*The price of labor power tends towards the cost of reproduction of the worker.* As a new field of employment opens up, there are first few [[proletariat|workers]] who can qualify for the role. Then, as more investment in training and education appears, the labor pool widens and competition for jobs increases. 

This drives down [[wages]] to their lower bound - the cost of social reproduction of that laborer. See: [[Social reproduction costs determines the minimum price of labor power]]. 

Just as [[The rate of profit tends to fall]], so too does the logic of competition play out in the labor market. However, this process is not inevitable. [[The social wage flows from class struggle]].
