# Linear regression assumes linear relationship. 
When performing a [[linear regression]], we're assuming there really is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Howver, [[Few relationships are truly linear]]. 

We can check for this by creating a scatter plot of $x$ and $y$ and looking for visual signs of linearity. 

If this assumption is violated, we can perform a nonlinear transformation on one or more variables, or add another variable to increase the linearity.
