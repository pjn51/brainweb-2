*Lenin called imperialism parasitic.* In his book, [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)#VIII Parasitism and decay of capitalism]], [[Lenin]] explains the nature of [[imperialism]] as fundamentally parasitic.

He explained that the presence of monopoly prices removes the economic necessity of innovation and the elevation of technique, and even creates incentive for the holding-back of progress. For example, he cites the purchase and intentional hiding of new patents that was happening at the time, because it was more profitable for trusts to continue working under current conditions than to introduce a new technique to the market. 

He also noted that the investors in foreign [[capital]] have a different economic outlook than domestic [[capitalism|capitalist]], and highlighted that at the time, rentier income from investors was five times higher than all income from trade in the [[UK]], the largest trader in the world.
