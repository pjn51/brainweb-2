# The crisis of our era is the lack of proletarian leadership.
[[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] formulated this in his time, and I agree that all the objective factors for revolution exist today, and have existed for more than a generation. However, a subjective factor is required to take advantage of the objective conditions.

The leadership of the [[proletariat|workers]]' has been woefully unprepared for, and downright opposed to the seizure of power throughout the last 100 years. 

We also know that [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]], and that's why the [[IMT]] is preparing an organization of [[Marxism|Marxists]] that will be prepared to win the confidence of the masses at the decisive moment.

Therefore, the question presents itself: [[How should Marxists organize themselves?]] and more generally, [[What role do Marxists play?]]
