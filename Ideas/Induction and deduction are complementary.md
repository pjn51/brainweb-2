# Induction and deduction are complementary.
There's no need to choose between them once and for all. [[Induction is the process of arriving at facts from principles]], while [[Deduction is the process of arriving at principles from facts]]. 

However, [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]], not a static choice of one or the other.
