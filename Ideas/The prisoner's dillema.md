# The prisoner's dillema...
is a concept widely studied in game theory. The basic idea is that there are two prisoners who are being interrogated seperately. They are both told that if they defect and snitch on their companion, they will go free while the other is sentenced heavily. If neither snitch, they will get very light sentences. 

The idea of this game is to demonstrate that [[Individual rationality can lead to collectively irrational results]] - the best collective solution is to stay quiet, but the best strategy for any individual is to snitch. 

This is similar in nature to [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]], and it also has use in the field of psychology.
