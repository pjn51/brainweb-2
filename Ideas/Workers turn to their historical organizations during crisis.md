*Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis.* These [[mass organizations]] often have a track record for betraying the [[proletariat|workers]], but nevertheless, during the first phases of radicalization, the workers will turn to these familiar tools for guidance and as weapons in the class struggle. 

This is partially due to the fact that [[Human consciousness is conservative]]. 

This means that [[Marxists must be where the workers are]], physically in this case. It's important that [[Marxism|Marxists]] not isolate themselves from the debates and discussions that will arise in these organizations, especially as the radicalizing workers bump up against the limits of the leadership. 

By forming connections with the workers as they go through these struggles, the Marxists can ensure that [[No experience is useless]] and the workers learn the correct lessons from the inadequacies of the leadership. 

This situation is complicated by the fact that [[American workers have no party]].
