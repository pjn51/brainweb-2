*The [[IMT]] emerged from a split in [[Militant]].* In 1991, Militant was on the course to exit the [[Labour Party (UK)]] and form their own "mass party" called Militant Labour. [[Ted Grant]], [[Alan Woods]], and a minority of the group opposed this. They argue that they were expelled, while [[Taaffe]] and the majority faction around him argue that the minority chose to leave.
