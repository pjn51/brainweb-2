# Capitalism suppresses wages over time.
As a new field of employment opens up, there are first few [[proletariat|workers]] who can qualify for the role. Then, as more investment in training and education appears, the labor pool widens and competition for jobs increases. This drives down [[wages]] to their lower bound - the cost of social reproduction of that laborer.

A symmetrical process happens on the investment side: [[The rate of profit tends to fall]]. 

However, don't take this as inevitable. [[Lassalle coined the Iron Law of Wages]] to describe this inevitability, but he was wrong. While [[Social reproduction costs determines the minimum price of labor power]], this only sets the minimum bound - [[The social wage flows from class struggle]].
