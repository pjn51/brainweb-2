*A Zettelkasten can act as a thinking partner.* In [[How To Take Smart Notes (2017)]], Ahrens says that the slip-box framework for note-taking can act as a guide for what to write about, above and beyond a system for recalling information easily. He also says that this thinking partner is down-to-earth and will fact-check our ideas. [1]

By surfing the connections that the system creates, he says that we can make new connections and have new ideas. 

One big reason for this is that the ZK system allows for emergent associations. [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]. 

However, let's not go too far: [[PKM isn't an end in itself]], and the [[zettelkasten method]] doesn't replace the cognitive process.
