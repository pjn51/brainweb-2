*The American petty bourgeoisie is tiny.* Today in the [[USA|United States]], there are around 730,000 business owners, of which we can say no more than 50% are petty bourgeois, having fewer than 1,000 employees. That means we have about 365,000 petty bourgeois, out of a total population of 333 million. That means about 0.1% of the population is petty bourgeois [1].
