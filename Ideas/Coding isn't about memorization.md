# Coding isn't about memorization.
Learning to code is similar to learning a language. It would be pointless to keep a notebook of every word that you've learned in a langauge, and it's pointless to keep notes on how to do every little thing in a programming language. 

The coding workflow is coming across a problem, looking up things on stack overflow, solving the problem, repeat. I've learned from experience that I'm never going to turn to my own notes on a topic, because it's just as fast to look up the answers to my questions on the internet. Some people view searching for help as "cheating," but [[It's ok to be derivative]]. In fact, [[Closed source software is socially inefficient]]. 

Instead of taking notes on coding, [[Write legible code]] and [[Document your coding projects]].
