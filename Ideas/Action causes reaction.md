*Action causes reaction.* Whenever something happens, or a state of being emerges, there is going to be a reaction to that thing by the surrounding environment. This appears obvious on the human scale, but it also holds true on a much larger scale of social systems. 

This is closely related to the idea that [[Nothing exists outside its context]].
