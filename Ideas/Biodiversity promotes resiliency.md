*Biodiversity promotes resiliency.* [[ecosystem|Ecosystems]] with multiple species that occupy the same roles are much more durable when faced with disturbance and change. If one species collapses, another is ready to fill the vaccum. 

However, in ecosystems that are more homogenous, a collapse in one species can cause the whole network to unravel. 

This is a critical issue, because [[We've entered a crisis of biodiversity]].
