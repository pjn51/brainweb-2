*Religious movements tend to start as revolutionary and end as repressive.* In order to arise, a religious movement needs to find an echo in the desires of the masses ([[Religion is the opium of the people]]), and therefore represents a revolutionary desire to throw off oppression. However, as the religion becomes more and more popular, the leaders of the movement begin to fall under the sway of the influence of the ruling class. This is similar to how [[Proletarian leaders become subject to alien class forces]]. 

In the case of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], we can see how this process played out in [[The History of Philosophy (2021)]]. 

As for [[Buddhism]], we can see that a religious movement that at first fought the caste system, eventually was used to justify the genocide of Muslims in [[Myanmar]] just a few years ago. 

In general, this is due to [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]]. Religious movements must accomodate themselves to the needs of the ruling class.
