*Analysis must begin with observation.* This is the essence of philosophical [[materialism]]. 

[[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. If we fail to begin with observation of the concrete facts of the material world, we are engaging in [[idealism]], where we assume *a priori* that our abstractions are true, and seek to prove this through observation. This won't get us anywhere, because [[The material world exists]] outside of our consciousness. 

After we generate abstractions from our observations, we can return to establishing concrete perspectives in new situations, since [[Concrete perspectives are combinined abstractions]].
