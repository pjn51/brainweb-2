*The IMT considers itself a tendency rather than a party.* Instead of declaring itself the revolutionary party of the [[proletariat|working class]], the [[IMT]] recognizes that [[Revolutionary parties tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations]], and remember that [[Marx and Engels argued for the integration of Communists into the working class]] rather than attempting to form mass communist groups from thin air. That means that until such a time, we are organizing a future tendency within a revolutionary party. 

This means that we prepare for entry into mass organizations at the correct time, a tactic known as [[entryism]].
