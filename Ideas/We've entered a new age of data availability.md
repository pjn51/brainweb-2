*We've entered a new age of data availability.* In the past, the availability of data was a huge limitation to our understanding of the world. Now, because of the fact that the internet creates a wealth of readable information, there's more data at our fingertips than ever before. This has enabled a new generation of machine learning techniques to reveal the patterns that exist within this data. 

However, we can drown in this data, and with more information than ever, it becomes increasingly important to understand what data is essential, and what is superfluous.
