# Stalinism weakened the Soviet defense in WW2. 
The purges of the Red Army by [[Stalin]] and his allies severely weakened the might of the [[Russia|Soviet]] military. Furthermore, after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Stalin refused to believe that [[Hitler]] was preparing to invade, and punished anyone who pointed to evidence otherwise. Stalin actually demolished fortifications in [[Belarus]] and ordered the Red Army to stand down for the first 48 hours of the invasion, refusing to believe what was happening. 

This is evidence that [[Stalinism is counter-revolutionary]]. 

Despite this, [[Soviet WW2 victory vindicated the planned economy]]. 

Furthermore, the Soviets could have called on the German workers to rise up against the [[Nazi Party]], but instead, the war was waged on national chauvinist lines, with Ilya Ehrenburg announching "if the German workers meet us with red flags, they will be the first to be shot" [1].
