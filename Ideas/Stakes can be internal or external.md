# Stakes can be internal or external. 
Internal stakes are those within the mind of the protagonist, they reflect what the protagonist will think if they fail. External stakes are those outside the protagonist, and reflect what will happen to the protagonist if they fail. 

[[Good stories have stakes]], and should have a mix of both kinds of stakes.
