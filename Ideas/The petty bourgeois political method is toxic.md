*The petty bourgeois political method is toxic.* This method is characterized by a resistance to collective discipline, an emphasis on individualism, eclecticism, a refusal to take theory seriously, and an inability to discuss political differences professionally. 
 
Also, [[The petty bourgeoisie prefers endless debate]].

This is something that is discussed in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]].
