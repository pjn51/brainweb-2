*Stalin was a representative of the Soviet bureaucracy.* After the October revolution failed to spark an international socialist revolution, [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] where the bureaucracy was able to establish a situation of proletarian [[Bonapartism]]. 

[[Stalin]] played a useful role as a trusted "old [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]]" who was flexible and willing to cater to the interests of this new bureaucracy. 

In order to fortify his position, Stalin purged most of the other Bolsheviks who were unwilling to admit defeat. Unlike [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]], whose support of harsh measures ([[During the Russian Civil War, Trotsky justified compulsory labor]]) were based on a desire to preserve Soviet government, Stalin's purges and repression were an effort to drown the revolution in blood.
