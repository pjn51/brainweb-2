# Empiricism can lead to opportunism. 
If we view the world as static and unchanging as [[empiricism|empiricists]] do, then the only way to grow or move closer to power is by entering into alliances with the powerful. This is fundamentally [[opportunism|opportunist]], since [[Class collaboration is opportunist]]. 

In the other direction, [[Empiricism can lead to sectarianism]].
