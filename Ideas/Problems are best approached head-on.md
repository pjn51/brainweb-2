*Problems are best approached head-on.* The only way to really overcome a barrier is to attempt to do so. [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]]. On the internal front, [[Emotions can't be ignored forever]]. 

Interpersonally, [[Relationships require active maintainance]] and any problems in this area should also be tackled directly. 

I need to remember this because [[I have a tendency towards avoidance]].
