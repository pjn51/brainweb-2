# Problems are best approached head-on.
The only way to really overcome a barrier is to attempt to do so. [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]]. On the internal front, [[Emotions can't be ignored forever]]. 

Interpersonally, [[Relationships require active maintainance]] and any problems in this area should also be tackled directly. 

I need to remember this because [[I have a tendency towards avoidance]]. 

In terms of revolution, [[A revolution is all-or-nothing]] - you cannot approach class conflict without being prepared to fight.
