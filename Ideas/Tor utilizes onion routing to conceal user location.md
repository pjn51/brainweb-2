# Tor utilizes onion routing to conceal user location.
By encrypting and randomly bouncing communications through a network of volunteer-run relays, [[Tor]] allows users to hide their real IP addresses. 

This causes Tor activity to appear as if it is coming from the last node, called the *exit node,* rather than the true origin. 

Tor is used for both legal and illegal purposes. 

Tor also provides the foundation for Onion services. [[Onion services are an attempt to anonymize server identity]].
