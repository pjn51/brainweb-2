*Lenin explained that imperialism strengthens opportunism.* In his book, [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)#VIII Parasitism and decay of capitalism]], [[Lenin]] says...

> [[Imperialism]]... makes it economically possible to bribe the upper strata of the [[proletariat]], and thereby fosters, gives shape to, and strengthens [[opportunism]]. 

This is one of the mechanisms that was used in the [[USA]] to divide the working class against itself ([[Racism has divided the working class]]).
