# "Socialism in one country" is a lie. 
After [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]], the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] saw the need to chart a path that didn't require revolutionary confrontation with the [[capitalism|capitalist]] world. This meant they had to abandon the internationalism, which had been, and still is, [[Internationalism is essential to the workers' movement|essential to the workers movement]]. 

They did this by proclaiming that [[socialism]] could be constructed in a single country, thus obviating the need for world revolution. 

However, [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]], and even a developed country like [[Germany]] or the [[USA]] would have serious issues moving towards socialism in a meaningful way if isolated from the rest of the world. 

This policy provided the ideological cover for the [[Comintern]] to begin to prioritize [[Russia|Soviet]] national interests over the interests of the world revolution. Ultimately, [[The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s]]. 

Just another reason why [[Stalinism is counter-revolutionary]].
