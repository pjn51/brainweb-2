# The workers' movement develops through struggle. 
Initially, the [[proletariat|workers]] attempt to increase their [[wages]] individually, but this is impossible because there are always more workers seeking work than there are well-paying jobs. 

The [[unions|union]] movement is the natural solution to this. The workers combine their forces and gain leverage over the boss. 

The next level of development is the formation of a [[workers' party]]. As the workers fight the battles of the union struggle, the forces of the [[state]] are inevitably called in on the side of the boss. As the workers see that [[States are instruments of class domination]], they begin to agitate for political demands alongside the economic. Through the apparatus of a [[workers' party]], the workers enter the realm of politics. 

The challenges that this movement faces provide learning opportunities. [[Crisis reveals petty bourgeois elements within the workers' movement]]. 

Eventually, [[Revolutionary parties tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations]]. 

Seeking to clarify and speeed this process, [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]], and in doing so, [[The revolutionary party acts as a catalyst]]. 

However, [[Few relationships are truly linear]] - including this process of growth.
