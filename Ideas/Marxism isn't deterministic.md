*Marxism isn't deterministic.* The critics of [[Marxism]] tend to say that because Marxists believe in the material world, and say that the material world creates barriers to action, that Marxism is entirely deterministic and denies [[free will]]. 

However, [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] always said that it was the individual people who actually make history, and that material conditions create barriers and opportunities to action, but do not mechanically cause the progression of history. 

> Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. 
> -- Marx, *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte*

For example, the material conditions of the [[USA|United States]] in 2019 created an opportunity for a right-wing, 'populist', outsider to gain prominence on the electoral stage, but it was the person of [[Trump]] himself who actually took that opportunity and succeeded.
