*A FSA allows you to use pre-tax income for healthcare expenses.* A flexible spending account is a special account that I can put pre-tax money into that can be used to pay for certain out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. 

I can use this account to pay for deductibles and copays, but *not premiums.* Importantly, these funds do *not* roll over, so I have to use them all up within the plan year.
