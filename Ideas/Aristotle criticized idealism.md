*Aristotle criticized idealism.* In his book, *Metaphysics,* [[Aristotle]] rejected the idea that forms and notions can exist independently of the material world, thus criticizing the theory of [[idealism]]. 

> While the Ideal Theory involves us in numerous difficulties, its greatest absurdity is the doctrine that there are entitites apart from those in the sensible universe, and that they are the same as sensible things, except that the former are eternal while the latter are perishable. Those who uphold this view are saying in effect that there is an absolute Man, and Horse, an Hearth. They follow closely in the footsteps of those who teach that there are gods, but in human form; for as the latter merely set up eternal men, so the former do no more than make the Forms eternal sensibles.
