*Trotsky always defended the USSR as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]].* Throughout his life, [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] always argued that the [[Russia|USSR]] remained a workers' state, defending it agains the many critics who defined it as "state capitalist" or "bureaucratic collectivist."

Central to this argument was the idea that [[Trotsky didn't define the Soviet bureaucracy as a class]]. Because [[States are instruments of class domination]], if the bureaucracy isn't a class, then the state must exist as a workers' state. 

This argument is made in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]].
