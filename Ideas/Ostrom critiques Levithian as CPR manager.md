# Ostrom critiques Levithian as CPR manager.
First of all, Ostom note that proponenets of the Levithian solution for tragedies of the commons (see [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]]) assume that the [[state]] manager would have perfect knowledge of the carrying capacity of the CPR, as well as which actors are behaving selfishly. 

She says that when this is not the case, game theory allows us to see that the outcome is actually worse than when there is no management system in place. This is because inaccurate management information will sometimes reward bad behavior, and sometimes punish good behavior. 

Instead, she argues that [[Sustainability requires self-government]] by the producers.
