*The organizational is political.* The only division between the political and organizational questions of a socialist organization is artificial. Everything from meeting protocols to finances to structure should be firmly tied to questions of political theory. 

However, we shouldn't over-emphasize the form that our organization takes, and remember that the revolutionary content is the heart of the organization. [[Never confuse content and form]]. 

This idea also applies to division within organizations. In [[The Struggle for a Proletarian Party (1943)]], [[James Cannon]] explains that the [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] minority sought to divide the party over questions of organization, but the political content of the division was inevitably uncovered. 

Because of this, [[Organizational re-arrangement cannot solve political issues]]. We must deal with political questions on their own plane, and we must even deal with organizational issues on the political plane first.
