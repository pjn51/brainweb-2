*Laziness drives progress.* The struggle to get as much reward for as little labor as possible is the driving force behind the quest to increase the productivity of labor. 

In [[Terrorism and Communism (1920)]], Trotsky says as much:

> Man, as I have already permitted myself to point out, is lazy; that is, he instinctively strives to recieve the largest possible quantity of products for the least possible expenditure of energy. Without such a striving, there wouldbe venn no economic development. (p. 136)

Increasing the productivity of labor is quite important, because [[Labor productivity reflects social process]].
