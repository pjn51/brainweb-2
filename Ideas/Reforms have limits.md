# Reforms have limits.
Under [[capitalism]], reforms are sometimes possible. However, [[Reforms are only possible during economic upswing]].

Furthermore, reforms aren't a unversally positive thing - [[Reforms can be granted to undercut revolution]]. Reforms only represent victories when they increase the clarity or confidence of the [[proletariat]]. 

For these reasons, [[Reformism isn't revolutionary]] - we cannot achieve [[socialism]] through gradual reforms. [[Action causes reaction]], and as long as there is a [[bourgeoisie]], they will attept to reverse any gains made by the [[proletariat|workers]].
