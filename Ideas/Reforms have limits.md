*Reforms have limits.* Under [[capitalism]], reforms are sometimes possible. [[Reforms are only possible during economic upswing]], and [[Reforms can be granted to undercut revolution]]. However, [[Reformism isn't revolutionary]] - we cannot achieve [[socialism]] through gradual reforms. [[Action causes reaction]], and as long as there is a [[bourgeoisie]], they will attept to reverse any gains made by the [[proletariat|workers]].
