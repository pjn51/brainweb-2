*After Locke, idealists made the advances in thought.* Of course, this is very curious since [[idealism]] is a totally false conclusion. However, after [[Locke]] and the other English materialists stalled out and limited themselves ([[To Engels, English materialism became one-sided]]), it was the idealists who were more free to move forward. 

We can see this in the advances of [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Leibnitz]], and of course, [[Hegel]]. 

However, these thinkers were also limited by their [[idealism]], and it was neccesary to place their greatest achievements on a basis of [[materialism]]. [[Marx inverted Hegel's dialectic]] to do this.
