*Pirsig counterposed classical and romantic thinking.* In his book, [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance (1999)]], Pirsig talks a lot about the differences between these two modes of thought, as he sees them. 

He said that *classical thinking* is the mode of thought of an engineer, who is more concerened with underlying structure than with exterior form.

Conversely, he said that *romantic thinking* is the mode of thought of an artist, who is more concerned with appearance and outward form than with function.
