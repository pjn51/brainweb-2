*Never confuse content and form.* The internal content of a thing is related to, but independent of the external form that thing takes. This is an idea that applies to many, many things.

For example, [[Lenin]] discusses how "right doctrinairism" refuses to let go of the old forms of society, regardless of the content of these forms, while "left doctrinairism" totally swears off the old forms, regardless of the fact that revolutionary content may be able to surge through them. [^1]
