*Good hypotheses are essential.* Without a good starting point, the process of investigation, experiment, and discovery can be stalled for generations. 

This is the role that philosophy plays in the sciences. The prevailing philosophies of the day have an influence on the generation of new hypotheses in every field. 

This is one shortcoming of [[empiricism]]. How can one create a reasonable hypothesis from the immediate facts alone? There are an infinite number of facts, so where would you start?
