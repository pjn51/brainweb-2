# Appraisal gaps can make your offer more competitive.
When working with a multi-offer scenario, you can account for the fact that [[The bank has a say about your housing offer]]. 

If you agree to pay $1,000,000 for a house, and the seller agrees to pay, the bank will send an appraiser to evaluate the market value of the home. If the appraiser finds the house to only be worth $900,000, they will only loan you 80% of that, or $720,000. 

That means you can't get enough money for the original cost of the house. 

In a competitive situation, you can agree beforehand to put in extra money to fill this gap.
