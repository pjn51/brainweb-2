# Data can be operational or analytical. 
When collecting [[data]], there are generally two purposes. It can be operational - such as product inventory and bank balances. This form of data need to be up-to-date and secure. [[OLTP systems gather operational data]]. 

On the other hand, it can be analytical - gathered over time and used to generate insights or predictions of some kind. Analytical data are gathered via [[OLAP systems gather analytical data]].
