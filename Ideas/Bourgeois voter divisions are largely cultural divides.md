# Bourgeois voter divisions are largely cultural divides.
The real difference between Republican and [[Democratic Party|Democratic]] voters is their geographic location (urban vs rural) and their educational level. 

There's content that varies between the two parties. This is becuase the parties represent different sections of the ruling class, but generally most voters engage on the level of cultural groups. 

For [[Marxism|Marxists]], this shows that there's more revolutionary potential to "conservative" voters than most [[liberalism|liberal]] activists admit. Of course we can't allow social conservatism to go unchallenged, since [[Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed]]. 

One major reason for this is that [[American workers have no party]] that can channel their political desires. 

In fact, [[The Republican and Democratic Parties are codependent]].
