*Neutrality is impossible.* It's simply impossible to not have a stance on something. To abstain from taking a position is the same as taking the dominant position. 

[[James Cannon]] relates this to poltical cliques, saying that groups that chose to only focus on "organizational questions" (impossible since [[The organizational is political]]) inevitably drifted towards mainstream [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] political positions. 

This is why it's important to note that [[Taking a stance doesn't rule out objectivity]], since we all have to take stances if we're being honest with ourselves.
