*Enneagram Fives seek expertise.* [[Enneagram Fives fear being overwhelmed]] and [[Fives' basic fear is incompetence]]. In response to this, they shrink from relationships and the outside world, preferring an internal, intellectual focus that allows them to be self-reliant and competent. 

As a [[enneagram Fives|Five]] myself, my "area of expertise" is definitely political theory, namely [[Marxism]].
