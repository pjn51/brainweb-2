# Enneagram Fives seek expertise.
[[Enneagram Fives fear being overwhelmed]] and [[Fives' basic fear is incompetence]]. In response to this, [[enneagram Fives|Fives]] shrink from relationships and the outside world, preferring an internal, intellectual focus that allows them to be self-reliant and competent. 

[[I'm an Enneagram Five]], and my "area of expertise" is definitely [[Marxism]].
