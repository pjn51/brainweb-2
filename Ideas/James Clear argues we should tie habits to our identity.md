*James Clear argues we should tie habits to our identity.* In his book, [[Atomic Habits (2018)]], he says that those who wrap a specific [[habit]] into their identities are more likely to maintain that habit in the long term. 

> True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes a part of your identity.
