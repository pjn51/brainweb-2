*There are four modes of speciation.* In general, [[Isolation causes differentiation]], which eventually results in speciation. This can happen for one of four reasons.

In *allopatric speciation,* a barrier of some kind forms within the geographic range of the species, such as a mountain range or new river. Then, the two segments of the species begin to reproduce and thus evolve in isolation from one another, causing more and more differences to accumulate until [[Quantity transforms into quality]] and they can be classified as separate species. These differences can accumulate as a combination of different selective pressures and genetic drift. 

In *peripatric speciation,* a small subset of the population enters a new geographic area and becomes separated from the rest of the population, both geographically and genetically. Changes accumulate in the same way, but genetic drift is more important for this mode of speciation.

In *parapatric speciation,* a process similar to peripatric speciation occurs, but there is only partial separation of the new population from the old. Therefore, stronger differences in selective pressure must be present to cause drastic speciation despite the existence of some degree of gene flow between the sub-populations. 

In *sympatric speciation,* new species develop from old in the same geographic location. This must be caused by some form of selective breeding within the population over a period of time. Sexual selection is an important factor when it comes to this form of speciation. 

Dispersal strategy can also determine which mode of speciation is more likely, because [[Dispersal affects population distribution]].
