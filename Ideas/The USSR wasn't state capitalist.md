# The USSR wasn't state capitalist.
While [[Cliff called the USSR state capitalist]], I think he was incorrect, and I agree with [[Ted Grant]] and [[Trotsky]] - [[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]]. 

I think that Cliff's argument has some serious holes, which are explored in [[Against the Theory of State Capitalism (1949)]]. 

Throughout his attempt to characterise the [[Russia|USSR]] as state capitalist, Cliff fails to understand that [[Workers' states are contradictory]] - he over-emphasizes the regressive nature of them, failing to see anything worth defending in the Soviet planned economy. x
