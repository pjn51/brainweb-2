# Stoicism proposes a dichotomy of control.
[[Stoicism|Stoics]] such as [[Epitctetus]] argue that we should place things into one of two categories: things that we *can* control, and things that we *cannot.* 

By doing this, they believe we can refocus our energy on altering things that we can control, without wasting our time and energy worrying about things that we are unable to influence. 

The stoics want us to [[Set realistic goals]].
