# Class antagonism necessitated the state. 
As society split into classes, an armed group was needed to ensure the continuity of property relations. As these classes became antagonistic, this body became more and more [[alienation|alienated]] from the lower classes of society, until it was able to function as a true [[state]] - [[States are instruments of class domination]]. 

However, [[The state cannot reconcile class antagonisms]]. If it could, it would undermine its own purpose.
