# All capitalist labor is exploitative.
A [[capitalism|capitalist]] hires [[proletariat|workers]] for a reason - to generate [[surplus value]] for the capitalist. This means that either the capitalist pays the worker less than the amount of [[value]] the worker generates, or else the capitalist is running a failing business. 

Because of this, no matter the working conditions, the pay, or the generosity of the boss, a business must exploit its employees in order to expand operations and generate profit. 

Since the whole of the working class is always paid less in [[wages]] than the value of the [[commodities]] they produce, [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. 

This is a fundamental precondition to the argument that [[White workers don't benefit from racism]].
