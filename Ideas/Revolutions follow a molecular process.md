# Revolutions follow a molecular process.
Even during calm times, we can see that discontent is slowly brewing. Just like a pot of water needs some amount of heat to be applied before bubbles appear, we shouldn't lose hope if some amount of suffering needs to be experienced before revolutionary ideas start to appear. 

Eventually, the *quantity* of discontent will reach a tipping point, and [[Quantity transforms into quality]]. By this, I mean that the quantity of outrage eventually causes the passive quality of the [[proletariat|workers]] to transform into a revolutionary anger. 

This is one reason that a [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]]. If we wait until we can see easily visible signs of revolutionary ferment, we're far too late to establish a leadership capable of guiding the movement.
