*Socialism requires a high economic basis.* The theory of [[Marxism]] puts forward the idea that in order to achieve [[socialism]], you first need the [[economics|economic]] foundation of [[capitalism]]. 

First of all, only capitalism creates the [[proletariat]], which is the class that assumes power under socialism. Second, this class must have the free time and living standards to permit them to take the running of society into their own hands. 

Finally, only capitalism can lay the groundwork for the super-abundance that would allow for a cooperative division of the world's resources. Before the rapid expansion of the means of production, all that can really be done is the evenly sharing of misery, while now we have the ability to actually meet human need globally.
