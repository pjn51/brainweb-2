# A revolution is all-or-nothing.
Once a certain line has been crossed, it's a serious mistake to think that one can back away from the confrontation.

[[Contradictions trend towards resolution]]. Once contradictions come to a head, either the state and the ruling class will be defeated, or the leadership of the workers' movement will be crushed by counter-revolution.

This is the mistake that [[Allende]] made (1), and it happened many times during the convulsions in [[Germany]] in the 1910s and 20s (2). It tends to happen mainly to [[reformism|reformists]], who attempt to moderate the increasing radicalism of the workers while using it as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the ruling class. 

The ruling class will recognize the threat, and despite the fact that the reformists aren't exactly pushing the workers forward, they will strike at the reformists all the same.
