*The revolutionary party acts as a catalyst.* By elevating and clarifying the demands that the workers' movement puts forward ([[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]]) and pointing out the next steps needed to safeguard and expand on the gains made by that movement, the revolutionary vanguard acts in the same way as a catalyst does in a chemical reaction.

[[Catalysts accelerate reactions]], and the revolutionary party accelerates the development of revolutionary conclusions in the workers' movement. 

This is a big reason why [[Marxists must be where the workers are]], since if the Marxists don't come into contact with workers, we obviously can't have an effect on the movement of those workers.
