# The state cannot be done away with overnight.
Before the state can be abolished, [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]] that will require quite a powerful [[state]] apparatus. 

> Just as a lamp, before going out, shoots up in a brilliant flame, so the state, before disappearing, assumes the form of the [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|dictatorship of the proletariat]], i.e., the most ruthless form of state, which embraces the life of the citizens authoritatively in every direction. 
> - [[Trotsky]], [[Terrorism and Communism (1920)]], p.158
 
However, I would argue that the above quote applies to the [[Russia|Soviet]] situation more than it does the current one. Since [[States are instruments of class domination]], and the task of dominating the class enemies of the [[proletariat]] has become easier and easier as the proletariat's strength has increased, our need for repression will be greatly diminished. This is the same reason that[[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]].
