# Prefer systems to goals.
In his book, [[Atomic Habits (2018)]], Clear says that "you do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems."

He argues that there are a few advantages to a system-orientation:

1. Winners and losers have the same goals. Having good goals is not a guarantee of success.
2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Goals are outputs in the system-result dichotomy. We ought to focus on changing the inputs instead of choosing what output we want to happen.
3. Goals restrict your happiness. By setting fixed goals, we set ourselves up for disappointment if life gets in the way. This is related to how [[Stoicism proposes a dichotomy of control]]. 
4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress. When we achieve our goal, we may become de-motivated in the long term. Furthermore, [[Long term and short term goals often contradict]]. 

This supports the idea that [[Willpower is a bad foundation for productivity]]. 

Ahrens argues along similar lines, adding that setting up honest systems of pursuing facts that contradict our own beliefs, we can counteract confirmation bias [1].
