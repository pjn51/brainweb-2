*ML approaches are data-specific.* Some [[machine learning]] approaches are only possible using a specific form of [[data]]. There are two important distinctions here: presence of labels, and form of the target feature. 

The presence or absence of labels determines if you should use supervised or unsupervised learning. All [[supervised learning]] requires labeled data, since you're assigning data points to pre-determined groups. On the other hand, [[unsupervised learning]] is done on unlabeled data, where you're seeking to find emergent patterns in the data ([[Unsupervised learning detects emergent associations]]).
