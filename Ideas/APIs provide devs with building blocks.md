# APIs provide devs with building blocks.
Instead of building everything from scratch, companies provide [[What is an API?|APIs]] that allow developers to make use of their technology. 

For example, when making Instagram, the developers don't have to program a camera interface, they just tap into Apple or Google's camera API to use the latter's software. 

In this way, developers can focus on writing novel things, and [[Don't repeat yourself when coding|avoid repeating existing code]].
