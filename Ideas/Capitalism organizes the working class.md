# Capitalism organizes the working class.
During the process of [[primitive accumulation]], The development of [[capitalism]] out of [[feudalism]] caused the [[peasantry]] and urban [[petty bourgeoisie]] to shed layers, forming the [[proletariat|working class]]. We can see here that [[Opposites require each other]]. 

Out of this working class, [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]]. 

In some countries, this is contradicted by the fact that [[Capitalism atomizes society]] and [[Deindustrialization has begun to disorganize some sectors of the proletariat]].
