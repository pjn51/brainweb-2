# Predictive models must generalize to be useful. 
When predicting things via [[machine learning]], we cannot just create [[modeling|models]] that can understand patterns in [[data]] that they've seen. They must be able to extend their understanding to data they haven't seen. 

This is the process where we ensure against [[Sensitive models risk hallucinating patterns|hallucination]]. 

This is why [[model validation]] is essential.
