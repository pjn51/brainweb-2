# Capital tends towards concentration. 
We can see that under the forces of [[capitalism]], [[capital]] tends to concentrate itself in fewer and fewer hands over time. From the very beginning, when [[primitive accumulation]] kickstarted the development of capital,[[Primitive accumulation separated producers from means of production]], thereby concentrating personal property into private property, and into capital. 

[[Economic crisis accelerates concentration of capital]], wiping out the smaller [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]], and sending them into the [[proletariat]].  

We can see this happening firsthand in today's tech sector, where [[Cloud computing centralizes compute resources]], and thus centralizes the built capital. 

Once they've been established through the concentration of capital, [[Monopolies fight against the flow of capital]] outward and between industries.
