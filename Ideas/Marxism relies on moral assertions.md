*Marxism relies on moral assertions.* While we should [[Never confuse morality and strategy]], Marxism still makes fundamental moral claims about the world. 

[[Marxism]] asserts that progress is possible, and that such progress is a good thing. This stands in opposition to theories like [[postmodernism]]. 

Marxism also asserts that human development is a good thing, and that a positive aspect of [[socialism]] and eventually [[communism]] would be that human potential would be more accessable, and wouldn't be limited in the ways that [[capitalism]] limits it.
