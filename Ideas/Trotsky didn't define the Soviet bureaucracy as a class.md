*Trotsky didn't define the Soviet bureaucracy as a class.* Within [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]], [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] argued that since the bureaucracy was more of a "cancerous growth" on the social organism than a "historically indispensable" organ, it shouldn't be classified as a real class. 

The central axis of this argument is the idea that [[Classes arise due to the needs of production]], and Trotsky thinks there was no such need for a bureaucracy. 

This doesn't seem rock-solid to me, and the question remains in my mind: [[Was the Soviet bureaucracy a class?]]
