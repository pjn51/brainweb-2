# Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution.
We can think of a revolutionary movement as having objective (unconscious), and subjective (conscious) factors. It is the role of the [[Marxism|Marxists]] and the [[vanguard]] to act as the conscious element of the workers' movement. 

In his book, [[What is to be Done (1902)]], [[Lenin argued only the intelligentsia could move the workers beyond trade union consciousness]]. While I think he bent the stick a little too far, in general the conscious element is very important to move the workers towards revolutionary perspectives.

Because it fails to add to the conscious element of the movement, [["Diversity of tactics" isn't revolutionary]].
