*Linked lists have downsides.* While [[linked list|linked lists]] have certain advantages over [[array|arrays]], we can't access elements in constant time via indexing. It has [[complexity]] of $O(n)$ to access an element. 

[[Most programming languages use dynamically sized arrays]] rather than linked lists.
