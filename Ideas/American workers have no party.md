# American workers have no party.
Neither the Republican nor the [[Democratic Party]] is a [[workers' party]]. Both represent the interests of the [[bourgeoisie]], as evidenced by their lack of a mass character, their policy priorities, and their internal structures. In fact, [[The Republican and Democratic Parties are codependent]]. 

Because of this, the political energy of the workers is channeled and warped through these two parties, leading to the fact that [[Bourgeois voter divisions are largely cultural divides]]. It goes without saying that [[Workers need their own party]]. 

When it comes to the development of such a party, [[Revolutionary parties tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations]].
