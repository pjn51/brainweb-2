# Third Worldism is counter-revolutionary. 
This is an idea within Maoism that claims that there are no longer any [[proletariat|workers]] to be found in the advanced [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries. Instead, believers of this idea catergorize the vast majority of these countries as [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] "settlers."

However, this lacks nuance. [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]], not merely the labor of minorities or those in the third world. [[White workers don't benefit from racism]], and [[First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism]] despite the fact that both these groups have previously been bribed by the [[bourgeoisie|capitalists]] to the detriment of the class struggle. 

Today, arguing that white Americans would not benefit from a revolution is a deeply reactionary position. Instead, [[Marxism|Marxists]] should argue for class unity, and explain that [[Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed]] who must stand in solidarity with the other sections of their class.
