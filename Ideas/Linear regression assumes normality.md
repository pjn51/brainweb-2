# Linear regression assumes normality. 
A [[linear regression]] assumes that the [[residuals]] follow the [[normal distribution]]. We can check this using a Q-Q plot, a quantile-quantile plot. We would want to see a straight diagonal:

If we see a divergence from this diagonal we can either remove outliers or apply a nonlinear transformation to $x$ and / or $y$.
