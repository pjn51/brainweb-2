*Markets tend to externalize social costs.* This situation happens when dealing with common resources that individual actors cannot be excluded from. This raises the question: [[How can we manage common resources?]]

For example, the costs of air pollution are not factored into the cost of production of [[commodities]]. For instance, [[Overseas shipping is pollution-intensive]], but is much cheaper than more sustainable options. 

A social example is the rise of the opioid crisis in the [[USA]]. Providing insufficient preventive healthcare to workers is profitable for any individual [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], but it results in an over-prescription of painkillers, leading to a full-blown social crisis of addiction. [[Individual rationality can lead to collectively irrational results]]. 

This is one way in which [[Capitalism is destroying the world]].
