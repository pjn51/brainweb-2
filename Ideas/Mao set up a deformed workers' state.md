# Mao set up a deformed workers' state. 
Upon taking power after [[China's 1949 revolution]], [[Mao]] established a [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] [[state]] in [[China]]. He even wanted to invite the [[bourgeoisie]] into the agricultural sector, but the capitalists were too weak, forcing the CPC to take the road of collectivization. 

I would counterpose this with the [[Russia|USSR]], which [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] from a healthy [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]. China was never a healthy dictatorship of the proletariat.
