*All classification is approximation.* The world doesn't exist in neat categories that we can detect. [[The law of identity has its limitations]], and while [[Abstraction is essential to human thought]], these abstractions and classifications of phenomenae can only approximate the real world within certain limits. 

This concept applies both to human thought and to [[machine learning]]. 

However, [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]. Projects may eventually solve problems that we didn't intend to solve, so we should be open-minded during the process of deployment and see if we've created something that has broader applications than we initially thought.
