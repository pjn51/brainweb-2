*Lenin criticised Kautsky's definition of imperialism.* [[Lenin]] said that [[Kautsky]]'s definition of [[imperialism]] was useless ([[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)#VII Imperialism as a special stage of capitalism|1]]). 

[[Kautsky defined imperialism as agrarian expansionism]]. Lenin said that this definition gave one-sided emphasis to the national question, and was too concerned with the political expression of what Lenin considered to be a fundamentally political *and economic* process. 

Furthermore, Lenin says that it is *finance capital,* not *industrial capital,* that acts as the motor force for imperialism. In fact, Lenin continues, it was actually the decline in the power of industrial capital that spurred the development of imperialism in [[France]], for instance. 

Lenin continues the critique, saying that imperialist annexation isn't just looking for agricultural land, but more developed areas as well. He says that in general, Kautsky severs the politics of imperialism from the economics, and implies that there is a non-imperialist policy that these capitalists could just as easily adopt. 

In another assault on Kautsky, [[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]]. 

Lenin says that Kautsky's position on imperialism represents his total break with Marxism. He argues that Kautsky's idea reflects a reactionary desire to smooth over the contradictions in capitalism, to return to the good old days. Instead, Lenin believes the Marxist position is to move *towards* these contradictions, to *exacerbate* these antagonisms, in order to overthrow capitalism and imperialism once and for all ([[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)#IX Critique of imperialism|2]]).
