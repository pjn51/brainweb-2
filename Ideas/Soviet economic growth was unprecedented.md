# Soviet economic growth was unprecedented.
Even with the terrible distortions of the bureaucracy and lack of meaningful democratic input, the [[Russia|USSR]] increased their [[GDP]] by 900% in the span of 50 years, and went from having a GDP which was 33% of the [[USA]] to a figure of 50% of the American per-capita output between 1950 and 1977. 

This demonstrates that [[Planned economies outperform market systems]], even though [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] and [[The USSR faced serious early challenges]]. 

Furthermore, [[The USSR lacked inflation, homelessness, and debt]]
