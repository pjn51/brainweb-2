# Value is detemined by socially average labor-time.
[[Commodities]] that require more labor time on average are more expensive, while those that require little labor-time tend to be less expensive. 

However, commodities are rarely sold at their value, because of the other factors such as supply and demand that cause them to fluctuate above and below their values. Because [[Profit tends towards equalization across industries]], [[Marx]] argued the price of a commodity could be roughly modeled as the sum of the constant capital needed for its production ($c$), variable capital needed for its production ($v$), and the average rate of profit ($p$). 

$$
c+v+p
$$
It is this price that commodities are generally exchanged at under developed [[capitalism]]. However, Marx notes that the difference between price and value is only a relative one, and on the broader scale the sum of all price of production must be equal to the sum of all values [2].
