*Sixes are contradictory.* They can be strong while also weak, fearful and corageous, trusting and distrusting, sweet and sour, passive and aggressive, bullies and victims, thinkers and doers, tender and mean, generous and petty. They're a bundle of opposites [1]. 

I think in a certain way, we're all bundles of opposites, aren't we? [[Things change through contradiction]], and therefore things that change (which is everything) contain contradiction.
