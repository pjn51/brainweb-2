*I have a tendency towards avoidance.* When confronted with unpleasant emotions or thoughts, I have a tendency to repress and avoid dealing with them. This isn't a good strategy in the long term, because it doesn't result in any growth. 

Coupled with the fact that [[I have a tendency towards passivity]], this can make me a reclusive person at my worst.
