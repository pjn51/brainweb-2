# Revolutions are messy.
A revolution in society is the solution of the contradiction between the needs of production and the superstructure that moderates production. [[Revolutions re-align base and superstructure]], but don't erase the past superstructure in one fell swoop.

For example, the [[UK]] still has a monarch, even though the aristocracy was defeated by the [[bourgeoisie]] long ago. 

This is one reason that [[The state cannot be done away with overnight]] after a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution.

Despite this, I think that [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]].
