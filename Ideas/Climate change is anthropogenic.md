*Climate change is anthropogenic.* Because [[climate change]] is driven by the greenhouse effect ([[The greenhouse effect increases Earth's temperature]]), and humanity is meaningfully increasing the abundance of greenhouse gases, we can be confident that a significant factor in the warming of the Earth is related to our economic activity. 

This is one reason that I think [[The future will either be socialism or barbarism]]. [[capitalism]] simply doesn't have the capability of re-tooling our global economy in the ways that are necessary to avoid climate crisis.
