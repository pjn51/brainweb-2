# We should work with the garage door open.
This is from [[Andy Matuschack]]'s notes, where he says that we should aim to include people in our projects as they develop, not just communicate the results after they're completed. 

This has interesting imlications for my [[data science workflow]]. Maybe I should be tweeting about my projects during each stage of development. That would certainly create more of a narriative about my personal journey and would probably help my [[career]]. 

This also relates to the fact that [[Learning is collaborative]]. We ought to think of learning and creating as processes, not as finished products that we have to work on in secret until completion.
