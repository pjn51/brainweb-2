*Social development is always uneven.* This idea holds true for economic development, and the political development of the masses that happens relative to economic forces.

There will always be some areas that develop faster for one reason or another. The [[UK]] and western Europe was the first region to develop [[capitalism]], and as a result, they were the first countries to develop workers' movements. 

Because [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]], capital was inevitably exported from these regions to other areas, developing them and cutting across the class struggle in the home countries. 

Interestingly, when capital was exported from the home countries, it was done so using the most advanced techniques and technology. That means that the development of the colonies was done in a very uneven way, with advanced technology sitting alongside pre-capitalist elements. This was the situation in [[Russia]] which Trotsky discusses in a few of his works [1]. 

In a related way, the development of a new mode of production, and thus a new stage of society, is deeply affected by the history of the society in question. Revolutions don't open a clean slate and erase the historical quirks of society. In this way, [[Revolutions are messy]].
