*Socialism requires workers' democracy.* In order to surpass the [[Capitalism involves fractured economic planning|fractured planning of capitalism]], we must involve the whole of the [[proletariat]] in economic planning. This can only be done through a [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|workers' state]] that involves the input of all workers. 

One reason for this is that [[Supply chains are becoming more complex]] and can no longer be managed bureaucratically. This was one serious issue that the [[Russia|USSR]] ran into (see [[What happened to the USSR?]]). 

This is another way of saying that [[The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship]].
