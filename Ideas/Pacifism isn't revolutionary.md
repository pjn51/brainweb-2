*Pacifism isn't revolutionary.* Of course, the working class is naturally reistant to violence, but at a certain point in the class struggle, the bourgeoisie *will* employ violence in order to stop the progression of the workers towards power. 

When this happens, the movement is presented with a choice: either embrace pacifism and be destroyed, cast back, and ultimately lose the battle, or defend themselves. 

This isn't to say that revolutions have to be violent, to the contrary, [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]].
