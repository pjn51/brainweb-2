*Workers' states are contradictory.* While defending socialist property relations (nationalization and workers' control), they are forced, at least under the lower stage of communism, to defend bourgeois norms of distribution and social systems. 

For example, on the day after the revolution, it will still be necessary to pay workers for their labor, in order to ration commodities. This represents a fundamental contradiction in a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], and it is the bourgeois side of the contradiction which defeated the socialist side in the USSR eventually, when [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]].
