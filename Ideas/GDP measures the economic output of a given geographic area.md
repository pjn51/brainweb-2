*GDP measures the economic output of a given geographic area.* Gross domestic product, or [[GDP]], is a very common economic indicator, that measures the value of the goods or services created in a given region, often a country. 

This is different from [[GNI]]. [[GNI measures economic output owned by a country's citizens]].
