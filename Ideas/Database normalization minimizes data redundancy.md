# Database normalization minimizes data redundancy. 
It's common sense to minimize the size of a [[MySQL]] [[database]]. In order to do this, we can ensure that there isn't any repetitions of information. However, since [[SQL foreign keys relate rows]], we need to preserve *some* degree of repetition in order to preserve the relations in the [[relational databases|relational database]].
