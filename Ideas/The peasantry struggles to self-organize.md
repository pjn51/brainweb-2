*The peasantry struggles to self-organize.* Since social existence determines consciousness, and the social existence of the [[peasantry]] is an atomized, individual existence where one's own land is their chief concern, any self-organization of the peasantry tends to be sporadic, and lacks the will to change society. As they struggle for their interests, namely land reform, layer after layer disengage from the struggle as their land needs are met. 

[[Bourgeois revolutions rely on the peasantry]] and are only able to do so for this reason.

The [[proletariat]] doesn't have this attribute, making it more revolutionary.
