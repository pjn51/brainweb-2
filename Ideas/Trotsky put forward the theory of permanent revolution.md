# Trotsky put forward the theory of permanent revolution. 
Even before [[Lenin]] and other [[Bolsheviks]], [[Trotsky]] believed that workers in [[Russia]] could advance towards the creation of a socialist project, although such a project would be impossible to complete without revolution in the more developed capitalist states. He called this theory the theory of [[permanent revolution]].
