# Trotsky envisioned a ruthless workers' state. 
Discussing the nature of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]] during the [[Russia|Russian]] civil war, [[Trotsky]] said [1] that: 

> Just as a lamp, before going out, shoots up in a brilliant flame, so the state, before disappearing, assumes the form of the [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|dictatorship of the proletariat]], i.e., the most ruthless form of state, which embraces the life of the citizens authoritatively in every direction. 

This is in contrast to the orthodox view, which was that [[The workers' state is a semi-state]]. However, [[Lenin]] notes that until the higher phase of communism, the workers' state will have strict control over production and distribution [2]. 

This is further evidenced by how [[During the Russian Civil War, Trotsky justified compulsory labor]].
