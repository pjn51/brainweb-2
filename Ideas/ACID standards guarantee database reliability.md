# ACID standards guarantee database reliability. 
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. The general principle is that if one leg of the transaction fails, the whole process ought to be abandoned and the [[database]] ought to be reverted to the last stable state. 

[[Relational databases are ACID compliant]].
