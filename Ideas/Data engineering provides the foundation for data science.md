*Data engineering provides the foundation for data science.* [[Nothing exists outside its context]], and data science is no different. Since [[data science]] is impossible without predictable and consistent [[data]], [[data engineering]] is a necessary precursor process. 

Furthermore, since [[ML approaches are data-specific]], the way that data is provided by the data engineer can dramatically alter the workflow of the data scientist.
