# Wage growth doesn't drive inflation. 
A situation of general [[inflation]] is not driven by [[wages|wage]] growth. This is a common argument by [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] economists, who say that increasing wages will just result in the owners increasing prices. 

[[Ted Grant]] criticized this argument, saying that if [[capitalism|capitalists]] could raise prices whenever they wanted, they wouldn't wait for wages to rise - they would seek maximum profits at all times. Instead, he says, capitalists are limited by competition, and that's the same reason that they cannot increase prices when wages rise. They must simply narrow their profit margins to compensate [1].
