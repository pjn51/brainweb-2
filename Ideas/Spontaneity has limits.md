# Spontaneity has limits. 
While the masses have an incredible ability to self-organize, there are limitations to this. First of all, [[Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis]] regardless of the character of the leadership of these organizations. This means that they can be led astray by [[opportunism|opportunists]] or spineless leaders. [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]], and this can only be withstood by a hardened [[Marxism|Marxist]] backbone. 

[[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]], and this backbone must be developed before events reach a boiling point.
