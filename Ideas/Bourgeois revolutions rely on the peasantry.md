*Bourgeois revolutions rely on the peasantry.* Since the [[bourgeoisie]] isn't really a mass force, they are compelled to rely on the peasantry as a battering ram. [[Movements require mass action]]. 

[[Engels]] points out that this is a curious situation, since the bourgeoisie must then turn against the peasantry and subdue them, since it cannot permit the peasants to take their struggle to its conclusion. [1]

This situation is only possible due to an unfortunate feature of the peasantry: [[The peasantry struggles to self-organize]].
