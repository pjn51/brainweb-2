# Cloud MFAs are trustworthy.
As a part of [[My Atos workflow]], I have to differentiate between different forms of multi-factor authentication. 

Right now, we're seeing a lot of session token thefts, which allow bad actors to spoof MFAs from credential. Therefore, we can't take that as a trustworthy sign anymore. 

However, we can still view MFAs done in the cloud as trustworthy.
