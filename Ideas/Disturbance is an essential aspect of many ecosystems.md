*Disturbance is an essential aspect of many ecosystems.* Far from being an abnormal state of affairs, a disturbance such as a wildfire, flood, or landslide is often an important and necessary part of the evolution of the entire [[ecosystem]].

For example, fire is an important part of many healthy forests, and the failure of forest management practices to account for this is the reason why wildfires have become more intense and dangerous in recent decades. 

The impossibility of eradicating disturbance events is one reason why [[Biodiversity promotes resiliency]]. If an ecosystem cannot survive disturbance, it cannot survive in general.
