*Hardin's tragedy of the commons* is a term that he coined to describe declines in productivity of collective resources. If we imagine a fishery with multiple independent fishers, it's in each of their interests to take more than a sustainable amount, even though such conduct will inevitably degrade the resource, leading to collective ruin.

Basically, this idea is an application of how [[Individual rationality can lead to collectively irrational results]]. 

Hardin thought there was two primary solutions to this problem, one which he called "Levithian," after [[Hobbes]]. He argued that only coercion could compel each individual actor to choose the strategy that works for the collective interest. The other solution was privatization - to make the resource privately owned by a single actor. 

In her book, [[Governing the Commons (1990)]], [[Ostrom calls "Levithian or privatization" a false dichotomy]].
