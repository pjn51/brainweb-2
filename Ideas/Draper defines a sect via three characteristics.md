*Draper defines a sect via three characteristics.* In [[Anatomy of the Micro-Sect (1973)]], he says that a sect is a group that...

1. Claims to embody the socialist movement
2. Is a membership organization
3. Has rigidly set boundaries described by its political program rather than its relation to the social struggle

I think this is a rather poor definition, but it's an okay starting point.
