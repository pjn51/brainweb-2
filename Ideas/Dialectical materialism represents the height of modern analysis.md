*Dialectical materialism represents the height of modern analysis.* The mode of analysis represented by [[dialectical materialism]] is a step beyond the limitations posed by metaphysics ([[The metaphysical mode of analysis has limitations]]). 

By applying the laws of dialectics, understanding that [[Things change through contradiction]], [[Effect becomes cause]], and [[Quantity transforms into quality]], we can gain a clearer understanding of the world in motion, beyond the static understanding of bourgeois [[empiricism]].
