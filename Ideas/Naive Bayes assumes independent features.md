*Naive Bayes assumes independent features.* When working with the [[naive bayes]] algorithm for [[machine learning]], we need to understand why it's so "naive."

It's naive because the algorithm assumes that each feature is independent of each other feature, and that they all independently contribute to the probability of the target feature to fall into one category or another. 

Despite its naiviety, this algorithm does surprisingly well, and has the advantage of being rather simple ([[Complexity must be justified]]).
