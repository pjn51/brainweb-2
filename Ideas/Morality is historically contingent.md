*Morality is historically contingent.* Throughout the various [[stages of historical development]], [[ethics|ethical]] and moral theories develop within a certain historical context. 

[[Nothing exists outside its context]], and morality is no different. Under [[feudalism]], a moral person was one that knew his or her place in the collective society, and didn't try to subvert the divine right of their lord. Peasants must labor with their brethren in the fields, lords must watch over their people carefully and bow before the priest, etc. [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], and this form of morality (and therefore religion) was useful to keep society at a standstill to preserve the hereditary ruling class. 

Today, the upstanding moral citizen under [[capitalism]] is one who works hard, doesn't envy others, and donates some money to the Church every Sunday. We can see that the market forces and profit motive have corrupted all religions to the point that they no longer meaningfully stands in the way of the economics of capitalism. Those features that interrupt the flow of capital have been cast off over time. 

This demonstrates that [[Human nature is historically contingent]] as well.
