*Asking questions without proposing an answer is annoying.* Of course, it's ok for people to ask questions. What I'm talking about here is the tendency, particularly in the [[academy]], of essays or even books to bring up questions without actually answering them, or even seeking to find an answer. 

For example, a [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] article on race relations might just end with something like "With the breakdown of the traditional narriatives about race, class and gender, in what ways will future generations reify their own bodies and spaces?"

Regardless of how stupid this sentence is, if you're going to ask this insane question, try to answer it goddammit!!! This kind of bullshit fails to move the discussion forward at all, since [[Things change through contradiction]], including ideas. You actually have to propose a position, and then have people challenge it, and then you can actually answer questions. If everyone just sits around asking questions, we can all feel very smart but we aren't getting anywhere. [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]]. In this way, this behavior is deeply cowardly. 

The very idea of throwing question after question into the void is actually very postmodernist if you think about it. [[Postmodernism is a philosophy of despair]], with postmoderninsts lacking the confidence to try to analyze the world in any meaningful way. 

[[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] really roasts [[Shachtman]] for doing this in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]]:

> Shachtman declares: “The given state is not merely a degenerated workers’ state but ...” ... but? Shachtman has nothing further to say. Both the orator and the audience stare at each other, mouths wide open.

This is one characteristic of the petty bourgeois method of politics, and [[The petty bourgeois political method is toxic]]. 

Ultimately, this represents an unwillingness to engage in real analysis. Since [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]], an honest analysis must willingly proceed between these two phases. However, when academics refuse to engage in debate, and prefer asking questions to providing answers, they're refusing to move back from the abstract to the concrete.
