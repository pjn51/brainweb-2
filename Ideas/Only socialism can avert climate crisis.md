# Only socialism can avert climate crisis. 
[[Capitalism is destroying the world]]. There's simply no way that [[capitalism]] is going to avert climate crisis. In fact, [[Capitalism generates tragedies of the commons]]. We need a global system of economic planning that only [[socialism]] can really provide. 

For one, [[Military spending is massively pollutive]] and needs to be curbed if we are to progress, meaning that the nation state needs to be smashed. 

[[Planned economies outperform market systems]] in this way.
