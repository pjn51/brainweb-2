# Logistic regression uses a link function. 
The [[logistic regression]] algorithm uses a link function to translate the [[discrete and continuous variables|continuous]] input to a [[discrete and continuous variables|discrete]] output. 

There are many candidate functions, but traditionally the [[sigmoid]] function is used.
