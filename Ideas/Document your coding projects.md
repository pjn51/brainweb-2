# Document your coding projects.
When creating applications, we should [[Write legible code]]. The next step beyond having intelligible comments and syntax is to create documentation for our applications. 

While comments describe the functionality of code blocks within our scripts, documentation describes the overall use and functionality to those using our code [1]. 

This is useful both to our future selves and to others, including those who are looking at your projects as a resume of your past work. A good software company will appreciate good documentation of projects.
