# The Enneagram model views type as static.
According to the [[What is the Enneagram?|Enneagram]] personality model, our dominant type is established early in our lives and never changes. However, I think that [[Change is omnipresent]], and it seems [[idealism|idealist]] to suppose that there's an eternally unchanging quality about our personalities.  

This is one reason that [[I don't fully agree with the Enneagram model]].
