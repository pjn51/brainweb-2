*PKM isn't an end in itself.* Sometimes, all the hype and focus on [[PKM]] distracts from the fact that PKM is just a tool to accomplish a defined task, whether it's writing, teaching, or another way that knowledge is applied. 

[[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]], and PKM merely aids in this process, and does not replace it as the fundamental activity of knowledge work. 

When we talk about how [[A Zettelkasten can act as a thinking partner]], we should keep this in mind in order to avoid getting ahead of ourselves.
