# Technological transformation changes behavior. 
Marciej argues that we cannot transform the world technologically without altering human behavior as a reaction. He coins the rejection of this as the "Jetsons fallacy," and he thinks that the [[data]] industry has fallen prey to this regarding their attempts to measure and quantify the world. 

To me, this speaks to how [[Action causes reaction]] and [[Change is omnipresent]].
