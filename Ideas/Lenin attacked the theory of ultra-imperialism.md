# Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism.
[[Kautsky proposed the theory of ultra-imperialism]] and [[Lenin]] said that this theory, developed by [[Kautsky]], was incorrect, and represented a decisive break with [[Marxism]] ([[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)#VII Imperialism as a special stage of capitalism|1]]). 

Lenin said that this theory encouraged speculation that [[imperialism]] actually lessenes the contradictions and unevenness in the world economy, whereas he thought it increased these features. I think that [[Lenin's critique of ultra-imperialism has flaws]] because of this thesis.

Lenin explained that once the world is divided among capitalist associations, this process moves into an even more violent stage of redivision and conquest of one capitalist power by another, and said that Kautsky's "silly little fable" of peaceful ultra-imperialism was contradicted by reality and [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] economic data. 

Later in the book, Lenin mentions that this theory is also absurd because of the impossibility of preventing all competition in the world market for very long. 

Lenin says that international alliances of finance capital cannot exist forever, since the balance of power inevitably shifts due to the fact that [[Social development is always uneven]]. Eventually, he says, one country will have an advantage and will try and negotiate a better deal through force. Therefore, he says, such alliances are just truces in between periods of war ([[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)#IX Critique of imperialism|2]]).
