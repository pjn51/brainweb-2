*The Stefan-Boltzmann Law describes power emitted from a blackbody in terms of its temperature.*

$$
I[\frac{W}{m^2}] = \epsilon \cdot \sigma[\frac{W}{m^2k^4}] \cdot T[K]^4
$$

- $I$ = radiation intensity (in watts per square meter)
- $\epsilon$ = emmisivity (between zero and one)
- $\sigma$ = the Stefan-Boltzmann constant ($5.67*10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2K^4}$)
- $T$ = temperature (in Kelvin)

This law can be used to calculate the effective temperature of the Earth based on the power emitted by the Sun. Based only on energy from the sun, Earth's average temperature would be -18C, whereas it's really 15C. The difference is because [[The greenhouse effect increases Earth's temperature]]. 

Notably, this law assumes *blackbody* status. [[Blackbodies are abstract objects that have no reflectivity]].
