*Spaced recall slows down the 'forgetting curve'.* [[Ebbinghaus coined the 'forgetting curve']] to describe the rate at which we forget concepts. Proponents of the [[spaced repetition]] system argue that we can slow down this rate by reviewing concepts at specific times, ideally right as we're about to forget the concept. 

In practice, spaced repetition systems usually advocate doubling the time in between review sessions for concepts each time we're able to recall a concept.
