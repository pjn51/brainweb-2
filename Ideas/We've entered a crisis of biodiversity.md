# We've entered a crisis of biodiversity.
All around the world, [[ecosystem|ecosystems]] are becoming less robust and flexible as biodiversity collapses. If we compare the estimated extinction rate to the historical extinction rate that we can establish through the fossil record, we're seeing extinctions between 100 and 1,000 times faster than the baseline. 

This is a serious problem, because [[Biodiversity affects community function]].
