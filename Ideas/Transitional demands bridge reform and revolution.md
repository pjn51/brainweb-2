*Transitional demands bridge reform and revolution.* In [[The Transitional Program (1938)]], [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] discusses the need for a program that binds immediate concerns such as wage increases and employment with long-term perspectives for the need for a socialist revolution. 

The central idea of the transitional demand is a demand that reflects the [[class consciousness]] of the [[proletariat|working class]] while, at the same time, causing the workers to draw more revolutionary conclusions during their struggle to achieve it. 

In this way, [[Marxism|Marxists]] can [[Marxists shouldn't tail-end the movement|avoid tailism]] while connecting with the current political feelings of the workers.
