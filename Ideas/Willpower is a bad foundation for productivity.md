# Willpower is a bad foundation for productivity.
Willpower represents a conscious effort for us to remain on task, and remain productive. 

Any time we use willpower to prevent ourselves from going off course, that represents an inefficiency in the productivity environment that we've created for ourselves. 

Instead, [[Good productivity routines allows for flow]]. 

In a way, the use of willpower represents the conscious prioritization of long term goals over short-term ones, since [[Long term and short term goals often contradict]]. 

Instead, [[Prefer systems to goals]].
