*We're only as intelligent as we need to be.* Our brains [[evolution|evolved]] for a specific environmental context, and in the context of our ability to manipulate that environment. Therefore, it would actually be a waste of resources for our brains to be complex enough to understand things that are just irrelevant to most human activities, like quantum physics or the fact that [[Time is a fourth dimension]].
