*Heuristics are essential to human thought.* A heuristic is a simple, yet broadly effective strategy for engaging with the world. When we learn about the world, we develop heuristics in the same way that we develop abstractions ([[Abstraction is essential to human thought]]). 

For example, when we're trying to dress for the day, we don't always check the weather, and then try to figure out the percentage chance that the weather will be incorrect, etc. Instead, we probably look outside and see what a passerby is wearing, and we dress like them. This isn't always going to work, but it's simple and generally works well. 

It's important to know that these heuristics are not true in all situations, they just work well enough within our daily lives to be useful. A heuristic is fundamentally a classification method for phenomenae, and [[All classification is approximation]].
