# Imperialism renders the cooperative model uncompetitive.
As we enter the [[imperialism|imperialist]] stage of [[capitalism]], more and more [[capital]] is required in order to gain any market share at all. 

Therefore, it is increasingly difficult for small businesses, much less worker cooperatives, to gain access to the market. 

This is one error with [[Chomsky]]'s analysis, [[Chomsky sees the co-op model as the basis for revolution]].
