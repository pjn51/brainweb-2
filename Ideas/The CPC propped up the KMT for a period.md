# The CPC propped up the KMT for a period.
In 1936, the [[CPC]] captured [[Chiang Kai-Shek]]. However, they refused to execute him and declare themselves class-enemies of the [[Kuomintang|KMT]]. Instead, they chose to ally with the universally-hated figure, and dissolve their military apparatus into his organization. 

By doing so, they increased their numerical strength while drastically weakening their political strength and lost the confidence of a wide layer of the masses. [[Marxists seek to increase the clarity and confidence of the workers]], and this did the opposite. 

This was done at the urging of [[Stalin]], just another reason why [[Stalinism is counter-revolutionary]]. More specifically, this is an example of how [[The Popular Front represents class collaboration]].
