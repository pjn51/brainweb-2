*Movements require mass action.* We can see that historically, every class that has attempted to lead a revolution has been compelled to call upon the masses as footsoldiers. 

In the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] revolutions, we can see how the philosophers of the Enlightenment were used to rally the peasants and urban artisans to the cause of the capitalist class. 

In eastern Europe during [[WW2]], we can see how the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] were forced to call on the [[proletariat|workers]] and [[peasantry]] in order to fight [[Germany]].

Fortunately, [[Marxism|Marxists]] don't have to engage in this deception. Since we represent the actual interests of the proletariat, we can be truly honest. In fact, [[Communists must be honest]]! 

This is also a reason that [[Marxists orient towards the working class]], without a connection to that class, any movement is impossible.
