# Empiricism can lead to sectarianism. 
If we view the world as a collection of fixed objects (the standpoint of vulgar [[empiricism]]), naturally as [[Marxism|Marxists]], we ought not associate ourselves with irredeemable opportunists, reformists, or reactionaries. 

If those who don't have a [[socialism|socialist]] perspective cannot be won over, there's no need to engage in messy, difficult struggle within the workers' organizations. 

This mindeset inevitably leads to an abstention from the class struggle, and [[Abstention from class struggle is sectarian]]. 

On the other hand, also, [[Empiricism can lead to opportunism]].
