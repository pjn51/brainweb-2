*Under capitalism, past dominates present.* This applies economically as well as politically.

[[Marx]] relates this to the economic processes of [[capitalism]], saying that the accumulated dead labor of the past ([[capital]]) dominates the living labor of the present [1]. 

Elsewhere, Marx also says that the accumulated traditions of the past weigh like a nightmare upon the brains of the living [2].
