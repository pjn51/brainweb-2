*The French materialists were more radical than the English.* In the [[UK]], [[materialism]] emerged as the bourgeoisie was compromising with the aristocracy and crushing opposition to their left. This meant that the philosophy was made to serve the interests of an increasingly conservative class, and it lost its revolutionary edge. 

On the other hand, the [[France|French]] materialists emerged during the pre-revolutionary fervor before the revolution. This meant that it was possible for these philosophers to push their new ways of thinking across lines which the English dared not venture. 

Thinkers who pushed the theory forward included Baron Holbach (who explicitly challenged religion), Condillac (who argued that only matter existed in the universe), and La Mettrie (who stated that all forms of life existed as matter organized in various ways). 

This process illustrates how the [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]]. The French materialists were only able to follow their ideas to their radical conclusions because of the social conditions of society at the time. These social conditions only arose in France due to specific economic forces. Conversely, the radical philosophy of the French materialists breathed new life into the development of French science, altering the material conditions.
