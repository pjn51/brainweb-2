*Action verifies perception.* When we want to gain objective knowledge about the material world, we apply our abstractions to this world and see what happens. If things go according to plan, while [[All classification is approximation]], we can still be more confident that our perceptions of reality are accurate, and we can alter our understanding if we fail. 

Through this process of action, we can bridge the gap between our sense perceptions and the material world. 

This demonstrates why [[Abstractions should be useful]], and in fact, action is the purpose of thought itself. We think in order to act, in order to change the world around us or to solve problems for our survival. [[Thought and activity are inseperable]]. 

[[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]], and the ultimate movement towards the concrete is movement into action, into experimental verification of our perspectives. 

Conversely, we cannot verify our perceptions without acting upon them. This is one reason why [[Human consciousness is conservative]] - it takes great events to actually test our preconceptions about the nature of society and the ruling class. 

[[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], and an experiment, an action, is the *event* we're talking about here.
