*Marx asserts that existence determines consciousness.* In [[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859)]], [[Marx]] says that the economic foundations of our lives determines the way that we think about the world. 

This argument is related to [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]] because the development of an individual's social consciousness is like the development of the superstructure in miniature, and the development of individual consciousnesses do play a part in the development of the superstructure, although not the defining part. [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]], and this means the superstructure is far more reflective of their interests and beliefs than it is of the average beliefs of society. 

Note that [[Marxism isn't deterministic]], and existence merely defines the way that consciousness develops *on average,* and there are certainly outliers in any population. 

Because [[Consciousness changes on the basis of events]], it's no surprise that the weight of the countless daily events by which we survive have an impact on our consciousness.
