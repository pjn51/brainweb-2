*Evolution indicates the existence of free will.* If we take it as a given that [[evolution]], in the long run, only results in changes to an organism that are in some way beneficial, and that humanity evolved from an organism that lacked consciousness, then that implies there is some benefit to [[free will]]. 

If that is the case, then it naturally follows that we have some degree of freedom or control over our own actions, otherwise why would we be self-conscious and not operate strictly by unconscious instinct?

[[Trotsky]] makes this argument in his philisophical notebooks that I have as a part of [[The Revolutionary Philosophy of Marxism (2018)]].
