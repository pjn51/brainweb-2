# Bourgeois science refuses to analyze society. 
The [[scientific method]] allows us to understand the world relatively clearly, or at least much more clearly than the [[religion]] and guesswork that came before it. We've learned that natural phenomena are guided by general laws and take the forms of processes with successive stages. 

However, under the reign of the [[bourgeoisie]], science is prevented from applying these same conclusions to society at large. This is why climate scientists clearly understand the approaching climate crisis, but are impotent when it comes to providing meaningful solutions to the crisis, since [[capitalism]] is the source ([[Capitalism is destroying the world]]). 

Instead, [[Marxism|Marxists]] use the method of [[historical materialism]] to explain the processes that guide human society.
