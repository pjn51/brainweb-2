# For Hegel, to be real is to be necessary. 
According to [[Engels]], [[Hegel]]'s account of what is *necessary* has been twisted by reactionaries to support the status quo. He said that what is real is necessary, but to Hegel, not everything that we see around is us actually *real.* For instance, he classified the late [[France|French]] [[feudalism|aristocracy]] as unreal, and supported the French revolution.
