# Things change through contradiction.
Everything has a dominant and a subordinate nature, and these two things are in conflict with each other. Through this conflict, the subordinate nature becomes the dominant one, and the process repeats again. This is one of the laws of [[dialectics]]. 

For example, I am alive. The dominant nature of my cells are to grow, reproduce, and maintain themselves. But I am also dying at the same time. That is the subordinate nature of my cells, that they will decay and die. Over time, the conflict between these two sides of the [[contradiction]] inevitably results in the tendency to decay becoming dominant, and me inevitably dying. 

Because of this, things that change (everything) must contain internal contradictions: [[Everything contains contradictions]].
