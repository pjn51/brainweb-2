# Responding is preferable to reacting. 
[[Meditation]] can help the meditator move from a reactive to a responsive mental state, where the initial impulses, which are often harmful or counter-productive, can be resisted and better responses can take their place. 

This is important because [[Long term and short term goals often contradict]], and it is the short-term goals which are often reflected in our impulses.
