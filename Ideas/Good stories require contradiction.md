# Good stories require contradiction. 
If there is no conflict in a story, then the story has no real stakes. [[Good stories have stakes]], so there must be a conflict, i.e. a [[contradiction]], either between the protagonist and an antagonist, or an internal struggle within the protagonist. 

This is also true because [[Good stories involve change]], and [[Things change through contradiction]].
