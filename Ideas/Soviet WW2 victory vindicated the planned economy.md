# Soviet WW2 victory vindicated the planned economy. 
The victory of the [[Russia|Soviet Union]] in [[WW2]] came at a massive cost, mainly due to how [[Stalinism weakened the Soviet defense in WW2]]. 

Despite losing 63% of their coal production, 58% of steel production, 41% of their railway lines, and other important industries to [[Germany|German]] occupation, the nature of the [[economic planning|planned economy]] was able to efficiently produce high-quality weapons, tanks, and planes and distribute them.

During the war, the planning bureau moved from five-year plans to quarterly ones, and even monthly ones for critical efforts. Without this, the USSR would certainly have lost the war.

This is a great example of how [[Planned economies outperform market systems]].
