# Biodiversity affects community function.
As biodiversity decreases, the ability of a community (in the ecological sense, a community is a collection of interacting species) to provide services and normal functions. On the other hand, [[Biodiversity promotes resiliency]]. 

These services include the provisioning of clean air and water, fuel, and food. 

This is a big deal, because [[We've entered a crisis of biodiversity]].
