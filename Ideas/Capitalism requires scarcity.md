*Capitalism requires scarcity.* At the advent of [[capitalism]], this scarcity was genuine. However, more and more, this is no longer the case. 

For example, [[Data are a commodity]], and the nature of data are to be infinitely reproducible. Where this scarcity no longer exists, capitalist production is compelled to introduce artificial scarcity through the use of trademark and business secrets. 

The introduction of artificial scarcity is one sign that [[Capitalism is in decline]]. 

This feature of capitalism is in tension with the fact that [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. Capitalism simultaneously drowns us in [[commodities]] while demanding that they remain in limited supply.
