# Kautsky proposed the theory of ultra-imperialism.
[[Kautsky]] is quoted as saying:

> “From the purely economic point of view, it is not impossible that [[capitalism]] will yet go through a new phase, that of the extension of the policy of the cartels to foreign policy, the phase of ultra-[[imperialism]]... the joint exploitation of the world by internationally united finance [[capital]]”. (_Die Neue Zeit_, 1914, 2 (B. 32), p. 921)

In his book on the topic, [[Lenin attacked the theory of ultra-imperialism]].
