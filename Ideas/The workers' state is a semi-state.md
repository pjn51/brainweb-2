# The workers' state is a semi-state. 
Most [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinkers predicted that the future [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' states]] would have an easier task ahead of them than the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]
[[state|states]], since the former had the task of suppressing a minority, while the latter suppressed the minority.

However, [[Trotsky envisioned a ruthless workers' state]], and the [[Russia|USSR]] certainly wasn't a semi-state. Instead, [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]].
