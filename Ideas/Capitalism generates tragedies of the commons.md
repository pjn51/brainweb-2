# Capitalism generates tragedies of the commons. 
[[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]] isn't transhistorical. [[Nothing exists outside its context]], and we can see that [[capitalism]] is unique in its generation of such situations. This is in part due to how [[Markets tend to externalize social costs]]. 

[[Sustainability requires self-government]], and this is antithetical to the capitalist mode of production. 

This is one reason why [[Capitalism is destroying the world]], and [[Only socialism can avert climate crisis]].
