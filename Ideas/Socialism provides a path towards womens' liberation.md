*Socialism provides a path towards womens' liberation.* Oppression is purposefully inflamed in order to divide the working class, and sexism is no different. Furthermore, Marxists see that culture and discriminatory attitides are tied to the underlying economic logic of society, and therefore only a change in the material reality of the world can eliminate the possibility of sexism, just like all other oppression. 

In fact, bourgeois [[feminism]] is downright un-revolutionary, since it seeks to divorce the struggle for womens' liberation from the generalized struggle for liberation. This stands as a barrier to the natural solidarity that workers have with each other ([[Workers have natural solidarity]]), and it plays into the negatives of identity politics ([[Identity politics have limited revolutionary potential]]). 

We can see a glimpse of the possibilities provided by the planned economy to women's liberation in [[Russia - From Revolution to Counter-Revolution (1997)]].
