# Ebbinghaus coined the 'forgetting curve'.
In 1885, he memorized thousands of nonsense words and then tested himself to see how many he would forget over time. He found that his forgetfulness follows a logarithmic rate - within 24 hours, he had forgotten 70% of them, and he had forgotten 80% after a month. 

He concluded that repetition was needed to preserve knowledge, and his work is cited by supporters of the [[spaced repetition]] strategy.
