*Alternate number systems exist.* [[We use a decimal number system]], but we can play around and invent others. 

For example, we can use a *seximal* system, where the unique digits are 0 through 6. 

```seximal
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21...

```

The only reason that we use a decimal number system is because we have ten fingers, [[Our number system emerged due to our biology]].
