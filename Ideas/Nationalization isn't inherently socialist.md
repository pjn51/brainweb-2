*Nationalization isn't inherently socialist.* On the surface, the [[state]] operation of industry has common features with [[socialism]], but we can see that under [[capitalism]], the bourgeois state is still a servant of the ruling class. For instance, [[Ted Grant]] described how the [[UK|British]] state was nationalizing failing industries for the benefit of the capitalists. 

In [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]], [[Lenin]] described how the [[Capitalism has fatal limits|limits of capitalism]] push the state to play a more and more central role in the economy. 

In order to be socialism, the [[proletariat|working class]] must be in power. Therefore, [[Socialism requires workers' democracy]]. 

Furthermore, bourgeois nationalization can demoralize the workers and mislead them into thinking that the only group capable of expropriating the owners is the bourgeois state itself. [[Marxists seek to increase the clarity and confidence of the workers]], and this runs counter to our aims.
