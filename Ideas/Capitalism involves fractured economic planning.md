*Capitalism involves fractured economic planning.* Firms within [[capitalism]] already make use of [[economics|economic]] planning tools. However, they make use of these tools in a very limited, short-sighted way. They use only their own [[data]], in order to maximize short-term profits rather than fulfill human need.

[[We've entered a new age of data availability]], and there's no reason that we couldn't use [[machine learning]] to coordinate economic planning on a global scale to optimize the production and distribution of goods according to human need. 

This idea is a big reason why [[Planned economies outperform market systems]].
