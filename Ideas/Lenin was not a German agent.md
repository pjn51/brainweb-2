*Lenin was not a German agent.* Some have attempted to slander [[Lenin]] by claiming that he was helped by [[Germany]] as a way to undercut the [[Russia|Russian]] war effort. 

This couldn't be further from the truth. By the time Lenin arrived in Russia, it was the Russian [[bourgeoisie]] which was in favor of a German victory, and the military seizure of Petrograd.
