# Benford's Law can detect altered data. 
[[Benford's Law]] says that in many sets of [[data]], the leading digit is likely to be small. This means that we can chart the distribution of all leading digits, and see if they correspond to the predicted distribution. 

This law has been applied to forensic accounting as well as used to investigate election results. Political scientists used the law to assert that the 2009 [[Iran|Iranian]] election was fraudulent. 

However, [[Benford's Law assumes variable magnitude]].
