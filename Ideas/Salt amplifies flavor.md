*Salt amplifies flavor.* In [[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat (2017)]], Nosrat says:

> Salt's relationship to flavor is multidimensional: it has its *own* particular taste, and it enhances the flavor of *other* ingredients. Used properly, salt minimizes bitterness, balances out sweetness, and enhances aromas, heightening our experience of eating.
