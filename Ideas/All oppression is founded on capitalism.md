*All oppression is founded on [[capitalism]].* In order for one section of the [[proletariat]] to be turned against another, there must be a system of private property that one section can be excluded from. 

> If a white man wants to lynch me, that's his problem. If he's got the power to lynch me, that's my problem. Racism is not a question of attitude; it's a question of power. Racism gets its power from capitalism. Thus, if you're anti-racist, whether you know it or not, you must be anti-capitalist. The power for racism, the power for sexism, comes from capitalism, not an attitude.
> -- Stokley Carmichael
