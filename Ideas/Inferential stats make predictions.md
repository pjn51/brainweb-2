# Inferential [[statistics|stats]] make predictions.
From knowledge about a sample, we attempt to predict different parameters of a new observation, or otherwise learn about the broader population. These methods begin with hypotheses, and use the scientific method to prove or disprove the hypotheses, because [[Science starts with the hypothesis]].

This is one of the major applications for statistics, and the fundamental area in which [[Data science and statistics overlap]].
