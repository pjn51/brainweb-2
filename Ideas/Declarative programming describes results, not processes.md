# Declarative programming describes results, not processes. 
When operating in an environment that uses this programming paradigm, we tell the program *what* to do, without specifying *how* to do it.

For example, [[SQL is a declarative language]]. We don't have to instruct SQL on how to sort things or retrieve information, we just tell it what we want as a final result. 

This is opposed to imperative programming - [[Imperative programming uses statements that change a program's state]].
