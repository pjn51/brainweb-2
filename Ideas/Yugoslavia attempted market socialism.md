# Yugoslavia attempted market socialism. 
Before its breakup, [[Yugoslavia]] attempted to chart a course between the [[capitalism|capitalist]] west and the [[Russia|USSR]]. Formally, all firms were owned by the [[proletariat|working class]], and these firms competed against each other. 

However, this didn't really move society beyond the issues inherent in the market, [[capital]] circulation, and [[commodities|commodity]] production. After all, [[The hell of capitalism is the firm, not the boss]].
