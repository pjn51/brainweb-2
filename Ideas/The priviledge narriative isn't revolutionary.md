*The priviledge narriative isn't revolutionary.* If we start at the understanding that [[White workers don't benefit from racism]] and [[First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism]], then we can clearly see how "woke" thinkers who frame everything in terms of individual priviledge actually serve as defenders of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. 

By rabidly proclaiming that white, first-world workers have something to lose from the demise of these systems of oppression, they create further division and confusion within the working class about the real effects of these systems.
