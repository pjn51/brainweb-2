*Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed.* [[Marxism|Marxists]] must demand that the least oppressed section of the [[proletariat|working class]] stand in solidarity with the rest of the class, and explain to them that they are actually hurt by holding such prejudices. 

For example, we must explain to white workers that [[White workers don't benefit from racism]], and we must explain to American workers that [[First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism]]. By doing this, we can help to unite the global working class. 

This stands in contrast to the attitude typically held by [[workerism|workerists]], that those who bring up issues of oppression are somehow dividing the working class. This is why [[Workerism isn't revolutionary]].
