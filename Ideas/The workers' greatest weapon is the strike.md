# The workers' greatest weapon is the strike.
Not a wheel turns and not a light bulb shines without the kind permission of the [[proletariat|workers]]. That means the best weapon the workers have is the witholding of their [[labor]]. By doing this, they can bring the functioning of society to a halt. Through the correct usage of this weapon, [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]].

[[Marxism|Marxists]] should study strikes, since [[Strikes are miniature revolutions]].
