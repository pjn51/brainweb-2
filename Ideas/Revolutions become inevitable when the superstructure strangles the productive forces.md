*Revolutions become inevitable when the superstructure strangles the productive forces.* When social systems are no longer able to meet the needs of the next generation, and living standards begin to stagnate or even decline, [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]] and a decisive break is inevitable. 

This is a manifestation of [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]]. As the economic needs of production change, more and more friction begins to form in society. At a certain point, [[Quantity transforms into quality]] and one of the classes in society can take power from the old ruling class.
