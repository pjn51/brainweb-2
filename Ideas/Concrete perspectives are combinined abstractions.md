# Concrete perspectives are combinined abstractions.
We must develop concrete ideas out of abstractions as an essential part of congnition. [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. 

When we move from the abstract to the concrete, we do so by combining abstractions appropriately, based on the laws of motion of the topic we are analyzing. 

For example, when we try to locate a planet astronomically, we have to take into account the laws of motion generally, combined with our understanding of the mass, trajectory, and velocity of the planet, etc. 

Trotsky talks about this in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]]. 

However, just because we must arrive at concrete perspectives from our abstractions doesn't mean that these abstractions are the starting point of analysis. [[Analysis must begin with observation]].
