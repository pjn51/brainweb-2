*Proletarian leaders become subject to alien class forces.* During all phases of the class struggle, the leadership that emerges organically from the [[proletariat|working class]] ([[Leadership develops organically]]) becomes bombarded by the influences of other classes. 

We can see this in the leadership of the trade [[unions]], political parties, and mass movements, both individually and on the level of the organizations of the [[vanguard]] of the class. 

When the leaders of the class cave in to bourgeois public opinion, this creates further complications to the question of [[How do Marxists approach workers' organizations?]]. The growth of [[opportunism]] within working class leadership ultimately gives rise to an over-reaction in the form of ultraleftism ([[Ultraleftism is the penalty for opportunism in the workers' movement]]). 

This is a huge reason why [[Marxists must fight against alien class ideas]]. We must provide a counter-weight to the naturally bourgeois leanings of the leadership of the class, especially when that [[Institutional leadership reflects the prior period's mood]] during a period of upswing and a dormant class struggle.

[[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] discusses this in [[The Class, the Party, and the Leadership (1940)]].
