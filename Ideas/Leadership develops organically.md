*Leadership develops organically.* Over time, the members of an organization with the most experience, clarity, and confidence inevitably begin to gain the trust and respect of the rest of the membership. Regardless of if they go on to fill official positions in the leadership or not, they have an influence over the rest of the organization. 

Because of this, [[Horizontalism isn't effective]], as it resists this process.
