# SMOTE can balance classes. 
[[SMOTE]] stands for synthetic minority oversampling technique. It can create additional [[data]] points through interpolation. We start by utilizing [[KNN]], then randomly picking a point somewhere between an existing minority class point and its nearest neighbor. At that point, we create a new observation of the minority class.
