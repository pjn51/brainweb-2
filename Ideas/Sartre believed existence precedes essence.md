*Sartre believed existence precedes essence.* He said that "man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world, and defines himself afterwards."

By this, [[Sartre]] meant that humans don't have a pre-determined essential nature, and we must choose that for ourselves. 

It is in the choosing of our essence that Sartre sees the potential for us to live authentically.
