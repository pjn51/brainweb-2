*The USSR was isolated.* [[The USSR faced serious early challenges]], and this was the source of many of them. [[Lenin]] and the [[Bolsheviks]] were attempting to hold out for a revolution in Europe to provide them aid, but this revolution never came. They understood that the USSR was basically in a state of siege that it couldn't survive forever. 

This was a central reason why [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]].
