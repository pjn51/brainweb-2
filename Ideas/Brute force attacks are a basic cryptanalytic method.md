*Brute force attacks are a basic cryptanalytic method.* In [[cryptanalysis]], the simplest method to gain access to a secured account is to try lots of passwords and see if you get the right one. 

For short passwords, this attack can be effective, but it becomes exponentially harder as password length increases. 

Becasuse [[256 bit security]] is the standard these days, this sort of attack isn't really useful. It would take the fastest computer in the world around $3.67\ \text{X} \ 10^55$ years to exaust the 256 bit space. [^1]
