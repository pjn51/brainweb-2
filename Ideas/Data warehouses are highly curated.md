# Data warehouses are highly curated. 
A [[data warehouse]] is a [[database]] that is optimized to analyse relational data in pre-defined schemas and structures. This allows fast queries for specific use-cases. 

This means that [[data]] within this structure must be cleaned upon insertion, and must be uniform and relational. A data warehouse is supposed to be a verified source of truth.
