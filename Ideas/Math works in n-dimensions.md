*Math works in n-dimensions.* Unlike humans, who have serious troubles moving beyond 3-dimensional thinking ([[We're only as intelligent as we need to be]]), math can work in any number of dimensions we want. 

Because machines operate using math, this is somewhat related to the fact that [[ML tools can be black boxes]].
