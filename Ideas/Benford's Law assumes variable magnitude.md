# Benford's Law assumes variable magnitude. 
[[Benford's Law]] cannot be applied to all [[data]]. It tends to be most accurate when values are distributed across multiple orders of magnitude. This means that a dataset of price of goods will fit Benford's law much more accurately than a dataset of prices of any individual good in the same currency, the values of which will be relatively similar. 

When keeping this assumption in mind, [[Benford's Law can detect altered data]].
