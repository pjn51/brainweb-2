*Democratic centralism establishes two-way accountability.* In one direction, it holds newer members accountable for "the party line" that has been decided on by more experienced members. On the other hand, it holds the leadership accountable to that same line that the members vote on periodically.

By holding each individual accountable to the will of the majority, [[democratic centralism]] avoids the processes by which some leaders begin to break under pressure (and [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]]). It also avoids the issues faced by horizontalist organizations ([[Horizontalism lacks accountability]]).
