*The internet is decentralized.* The internet consists of a collection of privately owned data centers, long-distance connective cables, and privately-owned infrastructure that connects homes and businesses to this network. No single entity has authority over the whole network, although there are some governing bodies (see [[Who controls the internet?]]).
