*Rivalry has a place under socialism.* Contrary to the defenders of [[capitalism]] who conflate the natural urge to compete with the capitalist system, there will be a place for healthy competition under [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. 

However, this rivalry will be relegated to the individual plane, where people will compete for recognition, honor, and self-gratification, rather than the necessities of life. In this way, the positive aspects of competition can be emphasized, while the negative aspects can be minimized. 

This process will happen organically, because [[Human nature is historically contingent]].
