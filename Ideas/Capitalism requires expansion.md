*Capitalism requires expansion.* Capitalism isn't sustainable because [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]]. The over-production of [[commodities]] that the workers cannot afford to buy necessitates the growth of new markets to sell those commodities in, and the drive to produce ever-expanding piles of commodities necessitiates the growth of extractive industries around the world. 

This has serious ecological ramifications, including the fact that increasingly, [[There is no wilderness]].
