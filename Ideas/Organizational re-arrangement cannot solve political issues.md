*Organizational re-arrangement cannot solve political issues.* This was a common tactic of [[Zinoviev]], who attempted to reform [[Comintern]] parties through replacing their leaders by decree.

However, this failed to solve any problems in the long term. Groups need to go through their own process of clarification and debate if they wish to progress past their issues in the long term. 

Any attempts to legislate unity without working towards it through honest debate are doomed to fail.
