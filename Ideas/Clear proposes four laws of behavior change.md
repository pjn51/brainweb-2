*Clear proposes four laws of behavior change.* In his book, [[Atomic Habits (2018)]], he says that we must incorporate the cue -> craving -> response -> reward cycle. He says that when we want to form a new habit, we should...

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

Alternatively, when we want to break a bad habit, Clear says we ought to...

1. Make it invisible
2. Make it unattractive
3. Make it difficult
4. Make it unsatisfying
