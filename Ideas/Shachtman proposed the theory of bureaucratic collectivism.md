# Shachtman proposed the theory of bureaucratic collectivism.
By this theory, [[Shachtman]] said that the [[Russia|USSR]] did not represent a transitional [[state]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]], instead representing a whole new stage of social development. 

[[Trotsky]] critiqued this perspective in [[In Defense of Marxism (1942)]], and I agree that [[The USSR wasn't bureaucratic collectivist]] and [[Soviet workers were not slaves]].
