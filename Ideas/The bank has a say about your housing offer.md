# The bank has a say about your housing offer.
First of all, [[There are multiple parameters to a property loan]]. The bank can also appraise the house at a different value than what the seller thinks it's worth, meaning that [[Appraisal gaps can make your offer more competitive]] and may be needed to supplement the loan from the bank. 

In a more fundamental sense, the bank decides how trustworthy you are, and therefore how much of a loan you can take out.
