# Revolutionary groups tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations.
We can see this in the case of how the [[Bolsheviks]] emerged from the [[RSDLP]]. It is utopian and [[ultraleftism|ultra-left]] to think that a tiny group of revolutionaries can just set up the revolutionary party. [[Workers turn to their historical organizations during crisis]], not to tiny grouplets. 

This is the reason that [[The IMT considers itself a tendency rather than a party]]. We understand that it is unlikely that our current organization will simply grow in size to encompass the millions of workers that would be required to actually lead the working class.
