# Our goal in life should be to be content, not happy.
Becase [[Everyone has an emotional baseline]], I think that our real goal should be to find contentment with what we have, not to seek happiness, which represents a positive change in our mood above our emotional baseline. 

Often times, I think people try to avoid all suffering in life. However, this is short sighted. [[Suffering is a basic human experience]], and even if you could totally avoid it, you would be doing yourself a disservice. [[Opposites require each other]] - there is no such thing as happiness in the abstract, only in relation to suffering.
