*Catalysts accelerate reactions.* Some chemical reactions take a really long time to happen on their own, but can happen in a fraction of a second if there is a catalyst present.

A catalyst acts as an intermediate, aligning the ingredients for a reaction much more efficiently than if their alignment was predicated on random movement. 

We can actually apply this concept to the political landscape, and point out that [[The revolutionary party acts as a catalyst]].
