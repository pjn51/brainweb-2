# The state cannot avert apitalist crisis.
The fundamental idea of [[Keynesianism]] is that the [[state]] can spend its way out of an economic crisis. However, we have to ask where that spending will come from. The state only has three options: they can tax the capitalists, tax the workers, or go into debt. 

If they tax the capitalists, this will exacerbate the crisis by reducing the investments that the capitalists are making in the economy. If they tax the workers, that reduces the demand for [[commodities]]. On the other hand, if they go into debt, they will delay the crisis but intensify it in the long run through [[inflation]] and [[currency]] devaluation. 

After the 2008 crisis, the [[USA]] government chose the third route of "quantitative easing," mainly in the financial sector. This is one reason why [[Credit is increasingly important to the global economy]]. 

Fundamentally, the bourgeois state cannot escape the [[Capitalism has fatal limits|fatal limits of capitalism]]. However, [[Planned economies outperform market systems]]. Notably, these sorts of economic crises don't happen within planned systems.
