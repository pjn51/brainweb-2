# CBT relies on patient participation. 
[[CBT]] is very reliant on the concept of having a *theraputic alliance* between therapist and patient. The patient plays an active role and can't improve unless they are dedicated to the process. 

This is because CBT often involves homework that the patient must complete, which is used to gauge the progress of treatment and next steps. 

This makes CBT inappropriate for those who aren't invested in improving. However, it is often useful, and [[CBT is a popular treatment for depression]].
