# Data science has a hierarchy of needs.
Before the flashy side of [[data science]] can be utilized, a lot of more basic work needs to be done. First, [[data]] must be collected, moved, transformed, explored, aggregated, and often labeled before [[machine learning]] can start to utilize it. 

In this way, [[Data engineering provides the foundation for data science]] by creating a strong foundation at the base of the hierarchy.

```
     / AI and deep learning \
    /   learn and optimize   \
   /    aggregate and label   \
  /    explore and transform   \
 /        move and store        \
/            collect             \
```

Some argue that companies must first build this solid foundation before progressing up the hierarchy [1].
