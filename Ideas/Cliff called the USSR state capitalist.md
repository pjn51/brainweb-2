*Cliff called the USSR state capitalist.* [[Tony Cliff]] argued that after the counter-revolution led by [[Stalin]] that the [[Russia|USSR]] was no longer a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]], and was now "state capitalist."

This was a break from [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]], since [[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]]. 

To support this theory, Cliff said that the USSR's economic system was less progressive than [[capitalism]], evidenced by the slowing rate of growth over time. He also argues that if the USSR was a [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?|workers' state]], then the workers would come to its defense upon its collapse in the late 80s. 

I think this argument isn't so great, and that [[The USSR wasn't state capitalist]].
