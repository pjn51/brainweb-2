*Bolshevism has a similarity to improv.* Both requre the actor to build on, not reject, the material that has come before, while adding to the content in a productive way. For example, it was [[Lenin]]'s opinion that the [[Bolsheviks]] needed to support the national liberation struggles of the minorities in [[Russia]], but point out the incompleteness that [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] national liberation provides, and invite them to remain part of a socialist Russia. 

For another example, a proper response to a [[Trump]] voter saying that they want to "drain the swamp" would be to say that we also want to eliminate corruption, and that the [[Democratic Party|Democrats]] are totally corrupt, but to also clearly explain that Trump and the GOP are also complicit, and only a socialist revolution would be able to totally eradicate corruption. 

This approach can reveal that [[Bourgeois voter divisions are largely cultural divides]], and workers who have found themselves behind either party can be won over to their own cause. 

I can see glimpses of this idea in [[Left Wing Communism an Infantile Disorder (1920)]]. 

This idea is reinforced by the vaccilation and over-correction we can see in movements not guided by a sense of constructive adaptation. [[Ultraleftism is the penalty for opportunism in the workers' movement]]. 

Because of the need to productively build on the existing demands of the working class, [[Marxists must be where the workers are]].
