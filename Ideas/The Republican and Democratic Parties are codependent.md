*The Republican and Democratic Parties are codependent.* The [[Democratic Party]] is especially reliant on their contextual position as the opposite of the Republicans. While [[Nothing exists outside its context]], these parties are downright codependent. 

Without the other party to compare themselves to, neither party has a really progressive program that anyone would choose out of a number of possibilities. 

This is a key reason why [[Workers need their own party]]! A workers' party would be able to counterpose itself to [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] parties, exposing them as united in their class interests and expousing a real way forward. 

In fact, this is a huge contradiction in American politics. One one hand, the two parties are virtually united in their policies when in power, but on the other hand, since [[Capitalism is in decline]], society is polarizing, forcing the parties to attempt to cater to more and more extreme attitudes and desires for change. 

This is an example of how [[Opposites require each other]] - each party only exists in relation to the other.
