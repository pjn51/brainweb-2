# Every class has interests. 
[[Marx asserts that existence determines consciousness]], and I agree. Because of our role in society, we all have perspectives that are going to align *on average* with others in our same position. 

Because of this, [[Neutrality is impossible]]. 

From this fact, we can see the inevitablity of the [[proletariat|workers]] movement, as soon as workers become conscious of their own interests. This is why [[Marxists strive to elevate the conscious factor of revolution]].
