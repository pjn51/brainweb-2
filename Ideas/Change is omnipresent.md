# Change is omnipresent.
In the universe, there is no such thing as a truly stable, unchanging state. Forces are interacting in a [[dialectics|dialectic]] that [[Contradictions trend towards resolution|eventually resolves itself]], [[Effect becomes cause]], and a new contradiction emerges. 

Because of this, any static model of the world will eventually run into limitations, and thus [[Nothing exists outside its context]]. 

This applies to all things, political, ecological, and personal. Because of this fact, we need an outlook of [[dialectics]] rather than [[empiricism]].
