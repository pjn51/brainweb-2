*Economic crisis accelerates concentration of capital.* During a crisis of [[capitalism]] (and [[Capitalism cannot escape crisis]]), smaller firms go under and their market share is gobbled up by companies that are able to weather the storm. 

This is an accelerating factor for the process by which [[Competition leads to monopoly]], meaning that [[Imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalism]].
