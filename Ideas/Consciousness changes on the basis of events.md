# Consciousness changes on the basis of events.
[[Human consciousness is conservative]] because we base our understanding of the world on what we've seen in our lives, and to some extent, what we have been told about how the world works by others who are following the same formula. 

However, the world is under no obligation to change gradually. For example, [[Evolution follows a pattern of punctuated equilibrium]], and many other processes do as well. After a period of gradual, imperceptible change, [[Quantity transforms into quality]], a tipping point is reached, and the whole situation changes very rapidly. 

In a social example, we can see that as an [[economics|economic]] crisis happens, [[Capitalism creates revolutionaries]] because people begin to see that the system is broken. 

This is one reason why [[The law of identity has its limitations]]. A conservative [[proletariat|worker]] may not always stay conservative, if he or she no longer sees that as a viable strategy for improving ones own life. 

Because of the non-linear aspect of this process, [[Marxism|Marxists]] can say that [[Revolutionary optimism is well-founded]]. We can rely on the non-linear processes of [[capitalism]] to create a whole class of people looking for a way out, and [[The revolutionary party acts as a catalyst]] for this process, hopefully speeding up the clarification process that the proletariat must go through on its way to revolutionary conclusions. 

However, [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]] in the moment that workers realize revolutionary conclusions. That will likely be too late in the struggle.
