# There are known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns, and unknown unknowns.
This is something that Cheney said, I think. 

- *Known known:* Something that you know, and you understand the value of knowing this thing. I know that it's not raining because I'm outside, and I'm happy this is the case.
- *Known unknown:* Something that we are aware of our lack of knowledge about. When I wake up in the morning, I don't know what the weather is, but I'm aware this is something that I should find out about.
- *Unknown known:* Something that I know, but don't understand the importance of knowing. I know I have an umbrella in my trunk, but I'm not aware that it's about to rain.
- *Unknown unknown:* I had no idea that there was a tornado happening today, and I didn't even know that was a possibility!

This is one way in which [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]. Emergent patterns allow us to detect unknown unknowns, while putting data into pre-existing categories only allows us to ameliorate known unknowns.
