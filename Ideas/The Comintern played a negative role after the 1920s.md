*The Comintern played a negative role after the 1920s.* After [[Stalinism]] overtook the [[Russia|USSR]] and [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]], the [[Comintern]] became a tool of Soviet foreign policy rather than a revolutionary organization. 

Concretely, we can see this in the betrayal of the [[Spain|Spanish]] revolution, the misleadership of the [[Germany|German]] revolution, and of the [[China|Chinese]] revolutions. 

Eventually, [[Stalin]] outright *dissolved* the Comintern in 1948 in an effort to strengthen his relationship with the [[UK]], [[France]], and [[USA|United States]].
