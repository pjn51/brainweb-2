# Workerism isn't revolutionary. 
[[workerism|Workerists]], those who fetishise stereotypical examples of the [[proletariat|working class]], tend to divide the class against itself by refusing to admit the better-off or less historical sections of the class into their fantasy of what the working class should be. 

A modern example of workerism is the fixation on the "PMC" that we can find in some online circles. [[The PMC isn't a real class]], and we should fight back against any division of the working class into 'worthy' and 'unworthy' workers.
