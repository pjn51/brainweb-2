*Communists must be honest.* It is our role to "say what *is.*" The [[proletariat|workers]] must see with their own eyes the validity of our predictions and perspectives if they're going to be won over. 

This means that difficult situations call for difficult answers. For example, [[Trotsky]] honestly appraises [[During the Russian Civil War, Trotsky justified compulsory labor|the need for compulsory labor]], [1] and he also honestly examines the general situation of the [[Russia|USSR]]. [2]

Trotsky also says that while the chief weapon of the [[bourgeoisie]] is religion, the chief weapon of the Marxists is materialist analysis. [1]

This fact is in tension with our use of [[Marxists should use positive demands]]. While we want to build on existing consciousness, we can't ever subordinate our need to explain the actual nature of things, or else we fall into [[workerism]]. And [[Workerism isn't revolutionary]].
