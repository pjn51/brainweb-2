*Contradictions trend towards resolution.* [[Things change through contradiction]], and [[Change is omnipresent]]. However, things cannot remain in a perfect state of balanced tension forever. Eventually, one side of the contradiction will begin to dominate the other, [[Quantity transforms into quality]], and [[Effect becomes cause]]. The victorious half of the contradiction will become the soon-to-be overturned half of the next contradiction, and the cycle repeats itself. 

This idea applies to a wide range of topics, and even supports the idea that [[Planned economies outperform market systems]].
