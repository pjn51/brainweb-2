*Capitalist "free labor" is an illusion.* Under [[capitalism]], the [[proletariat]] is told that we are free to sell or withold our labor however we like, and that we are free to find other employment if we don't like the current situation.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Workers are threatened, not overtly, but with base starvation and homelessness. [[capitalism]] maintains the illusion of freedom by externalizing repression as much as it can to so-called "natural forces." After all, behind everything is the [[state]], and [[Armed force is the defining feature of the state]]. 

Furthermore, no matter how many times you switch your job, you will still find that [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]]. 

This is an argument that [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] makes as part of his [[During the Russian Civil War, Trotsky justified compulsory labor|justification of compulsory labor in the USSR]].
