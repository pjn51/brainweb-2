*Capitalism atomizes society.* Due to [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]], the laws of [[capitalism]] seep upward and express themselves in all sorts of interesting ways. One way is that over time, relationships become more and more transactional, and communities fall apart. 

On the economic plane, this results in a contradictory development. While this process of atomization destroys unproductive bonds, [[Capitalism organizes the working class]]. On the other hand, [[Deindustrialization has begun to disorganize some sectors of the proletariat]].
