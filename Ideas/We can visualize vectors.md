*We can visualize vectors.* When visualized in space, the vector $$\begin{vmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \end{vmatrix}$$ would begin at the origin, and the arrow would end at the point (-2,3). We can add a third number to represent the third dimension, and we can even add more numbers to represent any number of dimenstions we want to. This is because [[Math works in n-dimensions]].
