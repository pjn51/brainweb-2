*The USSR faced serious early challenges.* After the [[Russia|USSR]] emerged from the civil war, they had to rebuild a devastated economy from practically [[feudalism|feudal]] conditions, while facing down the combined might of the advanced [[capitalism|capitalist]] world.

[[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] gives a good account of this in [[Terrorism and Communism (1920)]], as well as [[The Revolution Betrayed (1937)]]. 

This is one reason why [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]].
