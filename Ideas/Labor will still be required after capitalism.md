# Labor will still be required after capitalism.
Even when we move forward to a [[socialism|socialist]] and even a [[communism|communist]] world society, there will still be a need for humans to provide labor power in order to generate value. 

However, this labor won't be exploitative in the same way that [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]]. While [[Lassalle]] argued that socialism could provide the full value of the workers' labor back to them, Marx argued that surplus value will be extracted in the lower phase of communism. 

The surplus value of this labor will be allocated according to a plan that has been created by the organizations of the [[proletariat]]. In the same vein, it will also not be alienating in the way that [[Capitalism is alienating]], because the worker will more easily see and benefit from the end result of his or her labor, and will be more likely to understand its necessity. 

Especially during the transition out of capitalism, everyone may be required to work in order to perform the necessary tasks. We can see this clearly in the case of the [[Russia|Russian]] civil war [1].

Eventually, [[Socialism will increase leisure time]] due to the higher productivity of labor.
