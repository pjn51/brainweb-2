# Quantity transforms into quality.
This is one of the laws of [[dialectics]]. On the small scale, the quantity of heat applied to a pot of water will, at a certain tipping point, *qualitatively* change the state of the water from liquid to gas. 

For a more complex example, we can see that [[Revolutions follow a molecular process]], where the quantitative additions of friction between base and superstructure eventually cause a qualitative change in the [[class consciousness]] of the masses, allowing for the possibility of a revolution. 

When [[James Clear describes a "plateau of latent potential"]], he's referring to this phenomenon in the realm of personal [[habit|habits]] and lifestyle.
