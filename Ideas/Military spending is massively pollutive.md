# Military spending is massively pollutive.
The [[USA]] military emitted 59 million tons of $\text{CO}_2$ in 2017 [1]. If we take this as a standard yearly rate, and assume that this is standard per dollar of defense spending globally, we can see the total global impact of military spending. 
$$
59 \ \text{million tons} \ \text{CO}_2 \ \text{in USA} * \frac{100 \ \text{world budget}}{37 \ \text{US budget}} = 159 \ \text{ million tons} \ \text{CO}_2
$$

This means that global military spending accounts for around 0.4% of global $\text{CO}_2$ emissions.
