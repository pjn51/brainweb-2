# White workers don't benefit from racism.
This idea is totally alien to many on the left, who say that white [[proletariat|workers]] benefit from the systems of oppression that divide the working class. However, since it is these divisions that serve to weaken the class, and ultimately attempt to prevent the development of class solidarity and a revolutionary movement, white workers do *not* benefit from them in a final analysis. 

During times where the [[bourgeoisie]] were able to afford bribes to the white working class, such as during the [[USA|American]] colonization of the West, these bribes were paid only so that the working class wouldn't seek to reclaim the whole of what is stolen from it through the process of [[capitalism]]. 

If a robber comes along, robs you and your neighbor, and then shoots your neighbor, you have not benefited from these events. Since [[All capitalist labor is exploitative]], this is the situation of the working class today. 

The correct line on this is to emphasize this point, in order to make the point that [[Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed]]. We must hold white workers to a high standard in the fight against any prejudice in their community. 

In the same way, [[First-world workers don't benefit from imperialism]].
