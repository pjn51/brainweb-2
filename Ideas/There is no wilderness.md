*There is no wilderness.* The idea of a pristine, untouched place on Earth is a myth. [[The biosphere is a connected whole]], and our impact on one part of the web has spread to all corners. 

[[Some species are bio-indicators]], and we can see that our impact is being felt even in areas far from visible human settlement, such as the deep rainforest. 

One effect of this is that [[We've entered a crisis of biodiversity]], with species going extinct at a seriously increased rate. 

The primary reason for the destruction of "wilderness" is that [[Capitalism requires expansion]]. 

If we are to survive, we must change our current course.
