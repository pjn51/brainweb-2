# The greenhouse effect increases Earth's temperature.
As energy is absorbed by the Earth from the Sun, it is inevitably re-radiated into the atmosphere. 

Once in the atmosphere, it is absorbed by gases and once again re-radiated. Since this re-radiation is in all directions, half the energy will be re-radiated upwards, and the other half downwards. 

Greenhouse gases are those gases that absorb lots of energy, such as $CO_2$. The more of these gases there are in the atmosphere, the more time energy will spend traveling through our atmosphere before being released into space. 

This phenomenon is responsible for [[climate change]]. 

Because we're dramatically increasing the prevalence of greenhouse gases, [[Climate change is anthropogenic]].
