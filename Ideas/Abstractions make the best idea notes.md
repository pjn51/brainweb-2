*Abstractions make the best idea notes.* Since [[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]] and [[Concrete perspectives are combinined abstractions]], it makes sense for my [[PKM]] system to be a collection of abstractions that I can combine at will. 

This also plays well with the idea that [[New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic]]. By having free-floating abstractions that I can place into new contexts, I can develop novel ideas.
