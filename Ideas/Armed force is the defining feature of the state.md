*Armed force is the defining feature of the state.* The single feature of the [[state]], if we were to take away all others, is the police and courts system that protects the relations of production. This armed force is needed because [[States are instruments of class domination]]. 

Because they ignore or deny this feature, [[Anarchists misunderstand the state]].
