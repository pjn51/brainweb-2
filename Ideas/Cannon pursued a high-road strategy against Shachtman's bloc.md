*Cannon pursued a high-road strategy against Shachtman's bloc.* During the 1940s split in the [[SWP (USA)]], the majority behind [[James Cannon]] decided to not engage in the accusations that the minority were spewing along the lines of personal and organiational disputes, keeping in mind that [[The organizational is political]]. Instead, they stuck to their political perspectives. 

Over time, they were able to patiently explain the political questions at the base of the conflict, and win an even larger majority. 

Cannon wasn't concerned with those who would be won over by slander, since [[The vanguard comes under immense pressure during class war]], and those who couldn't handle the small pressures of a slanderous battle wouldn't be cut out for intense struggle anyway.
