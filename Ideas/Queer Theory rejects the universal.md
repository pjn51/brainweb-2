# Queer Theory rejects the universal. 
The proponents of [[Queer Theory]] reject the idea that there is a universal sex dichotomy, preferring to stick to the realm of discourse and social construction. 

They ignore [[The dialectic of particular and universal]], leading to a one-sided approach that limits their analytic ability. This is pretty [[postmodernism|postmodernist]]. 

This also limits their political potential, as they lose the ability to engage with real struggles.
