*Idea notes must be scoped.* I think that since [[Nothing exists outside its context]], I should make sure to apply this principle of [[dialectics]] to my idea notes. 

The format of idea notes lends itself to the process of abstracting from the particular to the general, and I should remember that [[All classification is approximation]] and no abstraction is an eternal truth. 

However, [[Abstraction is essential to human thought]], and I should take advantage of the fact that [[Idea notes weed out unnecessary details]]. Just make sure to remember that context is essential.
