# The rate of exploitation is the ratio between surplus value and wages.
We can refer to [[wages]] as variable capital ($v$) and [[surplus value]] as $s$ in order to model this:

$$
R_e = \frac{s}{v}
$$
When modeled like this, it is clear that the rate of profit ($Rp$) is dependent on the rate of exploitation as well as the organic composition of [[capital]] needed in that field. [[The organic composition of capital is the ratio of variable and constant capital]].
