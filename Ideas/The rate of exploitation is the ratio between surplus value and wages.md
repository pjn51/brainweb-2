*The rate of exploitation is the ratio between surplus value ($s$) and wages.* We can refer to wages as variable capital ($v$) and model this like so:

$$
R_e = \frac{s}{v}
$$
When modeled like this, it is clear that the rate of profit ($Rp$) is dependent on the rate of exploitation as well as the organic composition of capital needed in that field. [[The organic composition of capital is the ratio of variable and constant capital]]. z
