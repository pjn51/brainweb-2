*Summarization requires comprehension.* When we summarize a concept, we must decide which parts are the critical ones and which ones are details. This means that in order to summarize a concept, we must really understand what we're talking about. 

[[The Feynman learning technique centers summarization and explanation]], relying on this concept.

This is the reason why hand-written notes have been shown to provide greater comprehension. Since it takes longer to write by hand, the author is forced to think more carefully and summarize more. [1]
