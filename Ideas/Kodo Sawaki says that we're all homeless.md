*Kodo Sawaki says that we're all homeless.* In [[The Zen Teachings of Homeless Kodo (2014)]], Kodo says...

> Anyway, all human beings without exception are in reality homeless. It's a mistake to think we have a solid home. (p. 13) 

When he says this, I think that he means that we have no pre-determined role or place in the world, and that [[Change is omnipresent]]. 

[[Sartre believed existence precedes essence]], and in some ways, these ideas echo each other. Humans are put into this world without a static role or place that we belong. 

For Kodo, this also had a personal meaning. He was a homeless monk who travelled around between various temples, as opposed to most monks who had a home temple that they stayed at.
