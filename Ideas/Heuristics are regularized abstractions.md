*Heuristics are regularized abstractions.* We can think of a [[machine learning]] algorithm as trying to create an abstraction that accurately represents the [[data]]. We can also think of the process of [[regularization]] as an attempt to simplify this abstraction. 

In the same way, we can think of heuristics as regularized abstractions, i.e. interpretations of the world that are valued for their simplicity and broad usefulness.
