*Vectors are collections of scalars.* In [[linear algebra]], we use vectors as combinations of scalars ([[Scalars are single real numbers]]). 

[[Vectors are used in multiple fields]], from computer science to physics and elsewhere.

Vector names are noted as lowercase and bold, with each element italicized (because they are each scalars). Subscripts should be used to denote element position.
