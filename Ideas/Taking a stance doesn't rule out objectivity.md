*Taking a stance doesn't rule out objectivity.* 

> In the eyes of a phillistine a revolutionary point of view is virtually equivalent to an absence of scientific objectivity. We think just the opposite: only a revolutionist - provided, of course, that he is equipped with the scientific method, is capable of laying bare the objective dynamics of the revolution. Apprehending thought in general is not contemplative but active. The element of will is indispensable for penetratrating the secrets of nature and society. Just as a surgeon, on whose scalpel a human life depends, distinguishes with extreme care between the various tissues of an organism, so a revolutionist, if he has a serious attitude towards his task, is obliged with strict conscientiousness to analyse the structure of society, its functions and reflexes.
