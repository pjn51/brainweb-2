*Marx criticizes capital punishment.* In his essay, *Capital Punishment*, written for the *New York Daily Tribune* in 1853, [[Marx]] argues that the execution of criminals was not an effective deterrent for their activity, and advocates an alteration of the economic circumstances that caused such activity in the last analysis. 

In the article, he criticizes [[Hegel]]'s arguement:

> Punishment is the *right* of the criminal. It is an act of his own will. The violation of right has been proclaimed by the criminal as his own right. His crime is the negation of right. His punishment is the negation of this negation, and consequently an affirmation of right, solicited and forced upon the criminal by himself.

Marx says that this argument supposes that the criminal is a totally free individual, who has chosen to "negate right" of his own free will, ignoring the various factors that hem in and constrain our free will. 

However, [[Nothing exists outside its context]], and I don't think this idea is at all in conflict with the need for authority, or even harsh persecution, like how [[During the Russian Civil War, Trotsky justified compulsory labor]]. Marx says that in a final analysis, the purpose of punishment is to defend the social structure, not to uphold justice in the abstract. That means that under *bourgeois society* punishment is unjust, but it might be justifiable under other social situations.
