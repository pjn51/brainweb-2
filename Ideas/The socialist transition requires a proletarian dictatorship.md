*The socialist transition requires a proletarian dictatorship.* Even though [[Social revolution doesn't require much violence]], we *must* expect some kind of attempted counter-revolution from the [[bourgeoisie]]. We also have to take into account the fact that [[Social development is always uneven]]. This means that we ought to expect one portion of the world to undergo a socialist revolution while others are still under a capitalist regime. 

Needless to say, the newly-liberated region would be bombarded by attack from outside and from within, and would require a body of armed men ([[Armed force is the defining feature of the state]]) to defend the hard-won class position of the proletariat. 

From the theoretical angle, we know that [[States are instruments of class domination]], and therefore there must always be a state as long as there are multiple antagonistic classes in society.
