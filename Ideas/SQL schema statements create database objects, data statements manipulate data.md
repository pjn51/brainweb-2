# SQL schema statements create database objects, data statements manipulate data. 
In [[SQL]], statements are either [[SQL schema statements]], which create [[database]] objects, and [[SQL data statements]] which create, manipulate, and retrieve [[data]] stored in a database.

Statements are not case sensitive. Some database systems require a semicolon after statements, while some don't.
