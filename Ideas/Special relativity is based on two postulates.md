# Special relativity is based on two postulates. 
The theory of special relativity, [[Einstein proposed the theory of relativity|proposed by Einstein in 1905]], proposes that (1) the laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference relative to each other, and (2) the speed of light through a vaccum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. 

These two postulates are contradictory according to classical mechanics.
