# Economic base and social superstructure have a dialectical relationship.
[[Marx]] says that during our lives, we have to enter into "relationships of production" whether we want to or not (Note that despite this, [[Marxism isn't deterministic]] when it comes to human choice). He says that the sum of these relationships constitues the *economic base* of society [1]. 

He notes that upon this base, legal, political, and cultural *superstructures* arise, attempting to set boundaries for the development of society. These superstructures include the legal system, governing institutions, cultural norms, and other things. These structures extend into the cultural and ideological arena, and [[The ruling ideas tend to be those of the ruling class]]. 

This leads Marx to his next assertion: [[Marx asserts that existence determines consciousness]]. 

This is basically another way to say that [[Culture is downstream from economic basis]], since culture is an aspect of the superstructure that is defined by the economic base. 

The relationship between these two halves is [[dialectics|dialectical]]. While the superstructure flows from the relations found in the base, the superstructure also reinforces the property relations in the base. 

The rigidity of the superstructure relative to the base lays the foundation for revolution, since [[Revolutions re-align base and superstructure]].
