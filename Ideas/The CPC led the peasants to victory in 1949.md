# The CPC led the peasants to victory in 1949. 
Forced to turn to the [[peasantry|peasants]] after [[China's 1927 revolution]]  failed (due in part to the [[class independence|class collaboration]] of the [[CPC]]), [[Mao]] and others developed theories for how the peasants could play a revolutionary role. 

This was despite the fact that historically, [[The peasantry struggles to self-organize]]. Nevertheless, the CPC were able to win a war against the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] and [[Japan]] and eventually seize power in [[China]].

After their seizure of power, [[Mao set up a deformed workers' state]] that didn't feature workers' democracy.
