*Fives' basic fear is incompetence.* [[Enneagram Fives]] tend to doubt that they can do things as well as others, and compensate for this by attempting to use their intellect to become experts, believing that this will prepare them for life. This is what motivates their basic strategy: [[Enneagram Fives seek expertise]]. 

However true this might be, it has a limit. [[Problems are best approached head-on]].
