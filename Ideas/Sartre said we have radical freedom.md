*Sartre said we have radical freedom.* Since [[Sartre believed existence precedes essence]], [[Sartre]] also said that humans have the power and the responsibiity of choosing our own destiny. 

In my opinion, [[Sartre's notion of freedom is one-sided]]. Instead, we have to consider [[The dialectic of freedom and necessity]].
