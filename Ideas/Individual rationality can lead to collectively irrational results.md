*Individual rationality can lead to collectively irrational results.* We can see this in [[The free-rider problem]], [[The prisoner's dillema]], and in [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]]. 

We can also apply this to economics under [[capitalism]]. The individual search for profit by a firm inevitably leads to a decline in the average rate of profit for the whole industry ([[The rate of profit tends to fall]])
