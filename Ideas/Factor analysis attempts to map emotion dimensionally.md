# Factor analysis attempts to map emotion dimensionally. 
The field of factor analysis tries to map [[emotion]] to a few dimensions so that we can analyze similarity and difference between emotional states. 

Usually, the dimensions used are valence (positive or negative) and arousal (how energizing the experience is). For example, sadness would have negative valence and low arousal, while anger would have negative valence and positive arousal.
