		- Re-organized with standardized schema to facilitate analysis in Python
	- Have spent most of my time creating data ingestion pipelines from multiple sales platforms and sources, and dashboard tools for employees to estimate ideal purchase order quantities
	- Given me great experience interacting with technical and non-technical stakeholders, explaining opportunities, limitiations, and possibilities. Stakeholders range from engineers and operations managers

# Questions for technical round
- Is the purpose of this round to evaluate my problem solving ability, or my understanding of syntax? In other words, should I be prepared to do background research, like I would on the job, or should I be displaying my grasp of the syntax and concepts without turning to any resources?
