The seventh week of the bootcamp was pretty rough for me. I missed Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday due to being in the hospital. I got *some* notes from watching the pre-recorded lectures, but I didn't really absorb all the information like I usually would. 

The week was all about [[NLP]] and [[clustering]]. We began work on our fourth project.
