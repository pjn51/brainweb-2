# Notes for Friday, Jan 22nd

---
Today is the last day of [[metis week 3]]. We are running through all the presentations for [[natural amenity regression]], and we have a small [[SQL]] setup lecture in the afternoon. 

# Lecture - Intro to [[SQL]]
- [[SQL]] is a declarative language, python is imperative
	- Harder to debug [[SQL]] line-by-line, but we can focus on what we want to do in [[SQL]], not how we have to do it
- Common SQL use-cases: CRUD
	- Creating
	- Reading
	- Updating
	- Deleting
- Why use SQL?
	- SQL is good for accessing living databases. CSVs have to be manually re-downloaded while SQL can fetch up-to-date [[data]] from the [[database]]. 
- Goals for today
	- We need to setup PostGREs on our machine. 
- To start terminal, type `psql` in the terminal. 
- To list available databases, type `\l`
- To connect to a db, type` \<database name>`

If we wanted to start sql, connect to a database called "names", and pull all the entries from the candidates table but limit it to the first 5...

```

(base) patricknorman@MacBook-Pro sql-setup % psql

psql (13.1)

Type "help" for help.

patricknorman=# \connect names

You are now connected to database "names" as user "patricknorman".

names=# select \* from candidate limit 5;

 year | party | name

- We're recommended to check out the w3schools.com site for SQL tutorials, as well as something called [MODE](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/). 
- SQL is a necessity for the interview process. Companies really want you to know the basics of SQL.
