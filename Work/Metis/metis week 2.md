# Week Two of the Bootcamp

During the second week of the [[Metis]] bootcamp, we covered web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, we got into the exciting topic of [[machine learning]] a little bit, and worked on our [[natural amenity regression]], which is to create a linear regression modeling something we find interesting. 

We focused on learning the ins and outs of [[linear regression]], including the differences between Ridge and [[LASSO regression]], and the need to perform cross-validation to make sure we choose the best model and level of [[regularization]] for the situation.
