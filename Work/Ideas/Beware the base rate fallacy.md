# Beware the base rate fallacy.
People tend to assume that the statement, "This gene is found in 85% of cancer patients" is the same as saying, "Having this gene means you have an 85% of having cancer." 

That's akin to saying that  $P(A|B)=0.85$ is the same thing as $P(B|A)=0.85$, which is not at all true. We have to use [[Bayes theorem]] to find the probability of one statement given the other.

This is one way in which [[Humans are bad at probability]].
