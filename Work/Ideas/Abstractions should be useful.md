*Abstractions should be useful.* When coming up with a new idea, or adapting an old idea to a new context ([[New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic]]), we should consider more than if the idea is simply true or false. 

We must also consider the utility of the abstraction we're developing. Some ideas that are true are not useful. For example, it's true that we cannot perfectly predict the weather, and that therefore, news reports are not perfectly trustworthy. 

But only in certain circumstances does this idea become *useful* in addition to being true. When packing for a long trip, this might be a useful thing to keep in mind. When going out to grab the mail, you can probably ignore this true idea. 

Additionally, there are ideas that are actually *false* that are nevertheless very useful in some conditions. For example, height does not linearly increse with age. However, for a pediatrician, perhaps a linear model of height can prove useful in classifying some children as underdeveloped for their age. 

In this way, [[Heuristics are essential to human thought]] precisely because they are useful, as well as abstraction in general ([[Abstraction is essential to human thought]]).
