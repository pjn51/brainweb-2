# Wikis function hierarchically. 
When structuring information as a wiki, there tends to be concept pages that ascend in scope hierarchically, until you reach the level of abstraction. This allows the user to move up or down the taxonomical tree to reach their desired level of specificity. 

Of course, wikis utilize [[dense linking]], so there are also horizontal connections.
