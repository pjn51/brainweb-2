# Idea notes should be atomic.
For a note to be [[atomic notes|atomic]], it should contain a single concept or idea, and should be branched into multiple notes if the idea relies on other ideas, or results in trains of thought. 

If all our ideas were in a single note, it would be impossible to see connections between ideas, and develop new perspectives using combinations of abstractions ([[Concrete perspectives are combinined abstractions]]). Separation allows us to detect emergent associations between ideas, and [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]].
