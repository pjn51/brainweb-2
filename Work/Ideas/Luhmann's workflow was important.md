# Luhmann's workflow was important.
When working within the [[zettelkasten method]], he first wrote a note on whatever thought occurred to him. Then, he would leaf through all existing notes and look for relevant connections, which he would record. I can adopt a variety of this method in my thought cabinet. 

This can allow for ideas to be connected to multiple contexts, changing the meaning of the idea ([[Nothing exists outside its context]]).  

This also allows new ideas to emerge from old ones, since [[New ideas arise through an old idea + new context dialectic]].
