# There are four levels of job visibility. 
1. Job Alert (JA)
2. Organic (OV)
	1. For jobs with minor issues, or "evergreen jobs" that are always open to new applicants. Must be sponsored to appear in email alerts.
3. Sponsored Only (SO)
	1. For jobs with moderate issues. Must be sponsored by a company to appear anywhere.
4. Nowhere (NW)

By changing this [[visibility]], [[Indeed uses visibility level as a moderation tool]].
