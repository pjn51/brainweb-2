*Data can be visualized graphically.* When analyzing [[data]] and thinking about how to manipulate it, it can help to change our perspective. We can visualize observations as points, and features as dimensions. 

This is a way to understand why we must [[Beware the curse of dimensionality]], and how [[Math works in n-dimensions]]. 

Another way to visualize data (namely networks) graphically is through the use of [[graphs]]. These are useful when modeling networks. 

[[Data visualization technique depends on data type]].
