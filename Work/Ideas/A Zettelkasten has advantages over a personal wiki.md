*A Zettelkasten has advantages over a personal wiki.* First of all, [[Note friction should be minimized]], and the [[zettelkasten method]] does a great job of making new notes painless. Second, a personal wiki allows *facts* to build on one another, while a ZK allows *ideas* to build on one another. This is more compelling and useful to the user. 

I really don't ever look back on my notes to remember certain facts, such as when a historical figure died or the nature of a certain event. The thing that is most useful is remembering what the central ideas of texts were, and formulating my own ideas, which are often combinations of central ideas that I have heard and incorporated into my own understanding ([[It's ok to be derivative]]).

However, let's not go too far: [[PKM isn't an end in itself]].
