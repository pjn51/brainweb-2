# GitHub adds a fourth phase to Git.
When working with [[Git]], the files still stay on our computer. If we want to work with others or save backups elsewhere, we rely on a service like [[GitHub]], because [[GitHub is designed for collaboration]]. 

[[Git has three local phases]], ending with a local repository of commits. GitHub allows us to differentiate between the local repository and the remote repository.
