# Human thought is prone to long-term underfitting.
We often fail to predict changes that are happening when the process of change is prolonged. This is because we fail to recognize that [[Nothing exists outside its context]], and the abstractions we develop about the world only hold true under certain conditions, and will become incorrect if those conditions change. 

We develop an idea that we are healthy, and then it takes a long period of decline for us to adjust our mental model to the fact that we're aging and becoming more sick. This is one example of how [[Human consciousness is conservative]]. 

For example, there's a cultural crisis in the [[USA]] about our "standing in the world" declining, but the evidence of this process has existed for at least a generation or more. Despite the clear evidence that this process was ongoing, many people react in confusion to the direction we are traveling in.
