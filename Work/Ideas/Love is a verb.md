*Love is a verb.* Just like how [[Relationships require active maintainance]], the state of *being in love* requires effort and maintainance as well. 

Thinking of love as an external force that exists outside of us, or an involuntary sensation isn't a useful description. This leads us to await love arriving, and paralyzes our ability to study and understand it. 

Instead, when we think of love as an ability we must cultivate, we can work to improve not our loveability, but our ability *to love.* 

[[Fromm]] put this well.
