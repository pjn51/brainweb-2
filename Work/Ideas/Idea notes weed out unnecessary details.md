# Idea notes weed out unnecessary details.
Thinking in terms of main ideas helps the note-taker move through the text while separating the essence of the text from the immediate details of the text. This is one reason why [[Ideas are more important to record than facts]]. 

However, we should be sure that we preserve the context of whatever idea we've discovered. [[Idea notes must be scoped]]. 

[[To learn, elaborate and summarize]]. This fact about idea notes ties into this principle. By forcing the creator to abstract the most essential features of the idea, we build summarization into our workflow.
