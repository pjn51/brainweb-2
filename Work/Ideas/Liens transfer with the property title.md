# Liens transfer with the property title.
A lien is the result of putting your home on the line as collateral for a loan. Unlike other forms of debt collateral, if you sell your house, the lien on that house travels with the home. 

In order to make sure that the home you're about to buy doesn't have a lien on it, you can include a title contingency in the offer letter ([[There are multiple contingencies to protect you when buying a home]]).
