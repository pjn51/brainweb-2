*The coefficient of determination reports the proportion of predicted vs actual variance.* This [[coefficient of determination|equation]], also called $R^2$, is written:

$$
1 - \frac{\sum{\sqrt{(y_p-y_a)^2}}}{n}
$$
Where $y_p$ is the predicted amount of variance and $y_a$ is the actual amount of variance in the dependent variable. $n$ is the number of data points. 

This equation can be used as a [[metrics|metric]] during [[modeling]]. 

$R^2$ is just one minus [[RMSE]] ([[RMSE is a basic metric of model error]]).
