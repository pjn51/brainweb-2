*ML approaches are question-specific.* When we're trying to solve a problem using [[machine learning]] (and we should always [[Begin projects with a use-case]]) we must decide which approach we're going to take. 

We have to determine if we're trying to find a known-unknown or a known-known ([[There are known knowns...]]). If we know the question that we're trying to answer, then we're seeking a known unknown, and we should probably proceed towards [[supervised learning]]. 

On the other hand, if we don't know the question that we're trying to answer, then [[unsupervised learning]] is likely best, as we're seeking an unknown unknown. This domain is trickier to construct a workflow with, but it has it's benefits. [[Unsupervised learning detects emergent associations]].
