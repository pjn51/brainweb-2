*Sensitive models risk hallucinating patterns.* As the ability of [[machine learning]] algorithms to see patterns in the [[data]] increases, we run the risk of having our model invent patterns where none exist. 

Giving a weather-prediction model too much room to invent patterns may create an algorithm that sees some relationship between the day of the week, sports teams playing, and the rainfall. 

In order to avoid this, we can introduce [[regularization]]. [[Regularization punishes model sensitivity]].
