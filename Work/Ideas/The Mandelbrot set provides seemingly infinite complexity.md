*The Mandelbrot set provides seemingly infinite complexity.* When you zoom into the [[Mandelbrot set]], you find that the fractal pattern gets more and more complex as you zoom in, in an endless increase in the complexity of the pattern. 

The Mandelbrot set is one example of how [[Simple rules can produce staggering complexity]].
