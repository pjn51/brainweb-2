# EOQ seeks to minimize holding and ordering costs.
The EOQ formula, which stands for [[economic order quantity]], is expressed as...
$$
Q* = \sqrt{\frac{2DK}{h}}
$$... where $Q*$ is the optimal order quantity, $D$ is the annual demand quantity, $K$ is the fixed cost per order (such as shipping), and $h$ is the annual holding cost per unit. 

This equation seeks to minimize the costs related to shipping and holding inventory. 

For example, if we sell 10,000 units each year, shipping is 40, and it costs 5 per unit to store the units annually, we can find $Q*$ ...

$$
\sqrt{\frac{2*1,000*40}{5}} = 400
$$
This is saying that the optimal number of items to order at once is 400. We can divide 10,000 units by $Q*$ to find the number of orders per year: 25 orders per year. 

However, [[EOQ has some assumptions]].
