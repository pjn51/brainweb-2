*Pull requests merge branches in GitHub.* When working in [[GitHub]], we are often working with other developers ([[GitHub is designed for collaboration]]). This means that there are often other people we must approve our changes with before the changes can be adopted in the official codebase. 

[[GitHub branches allow for safe experimentation]] before we make changes official. When we want to do so, we submit a *pull request* where collaborators can review the changes and discuss them with the team. If needed, follow-up commits can be added, and then the changes can be merged into the base branch [1].
