# Indeed uses visibility level as a moderation tool. 
For jobs posted to [[Indeed]] boards, there are multiple [[visibility]] levels that can determine how many people are exposed to the listing.  

This visibility level is altered through [[Waldo]], and is a primary activity for the Trust & Safety team within [[Job Seeker Operations|JS OPS]]. 

[[There are four levels of job visibility]].
