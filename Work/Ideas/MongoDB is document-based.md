# MongoDB is document-based.
Rather than organizing [[data]] in rows like [[SQL]], [[MongoDB]] organizes data in hierarchical documents, that resemble [[dictionaries]] in [[Python]]. 

Here is an example of a basic document:

```
{'greeting': 'Hello World!',
 'some_days': {'0': 'Monday', 
			   '1': 'Tuesday'}}
```

[[MongoDB organizes documents into collections]].
