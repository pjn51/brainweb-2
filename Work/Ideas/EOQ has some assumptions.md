# EOQ has some assumptions.
[[EOQ seeks to minimize holding and ordering costs]], but it assumes some important things. 

First of all, it assumes that demand is constant over the year, which is almost certainly false. Second, it assumes that there is a fixed shipping cost per order, which is also not true. 

The EOQ model can only handle situations in which inventory is fully depleted, and then re-ordered all at once. It also doesn't take cash-on-hand into account.
