# In order to make progress, you have to fail.
If you want to gain insight into anything, or get better at anything, you have to actually try to do it, because [[Action verifies perception]] (aka "We learn by doing").

[[No experience is useless]], and you can build on what you got right, while trying something else for the things you got wrong. 

This is something that I should always keep in mind, because [[I have a tendency towards passivity]], and that's the recipe for stagnation.
