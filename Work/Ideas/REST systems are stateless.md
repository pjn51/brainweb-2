# REST systems are stateless.
This means that in [[What is the REST paradigm?|RESTful]] systems, the server doesn't need to know anything about the state that the client is in, and vice versa. Each actor needs to be able to understand any message recieved regardless of previous messages. 

This constraint makes these systems more scalable, faster, and more reliable.
