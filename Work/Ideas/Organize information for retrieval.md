# Organize information for retrieval.
Ahrens says that we should think like a writer rather than an archivist when we organize our notes. Instead of sorting ideas into their categories, we should sort them regarding how we might want to retrieve them for writing or speaking about them. ^1

For example, while this idea here is categorized as `#idea/learning/pkm`, it's probably more likely to be relevant to a question:

[[How should my index be organized?]]

This idea is the current answer to the question: [[Should I organize by question rather than topic?]]
