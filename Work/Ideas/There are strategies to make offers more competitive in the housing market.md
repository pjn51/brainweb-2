# There are strategies to make offers more competitive in the housing market.
This is important if you're expecting a multiple-offer scenario. 

Beyond just increasing the price you're willing to pay up front, you can establish an *escalation clause.* Let's say that a house is asking $500,000. If you suspect that there will be an offer at or above that price, you can say that you're willing to pay $1,000 more than the other guy, up to a ceiling of $510,000. 

You have to specify the ceiling and the increments that you will increase by. 

Another strategy is to waive a contingency. We could waive the inspection contingency, and  agree to purchase the house without seeing under the hood, removing one way out of the deal. Or, we could waive the financing contingency if we're pre-approved, but that can be risky if there's an appraisal issue ([[There are multiple contingencies to protect you when buying a home]]). 

Also, you can introduce an *appraisal gap.* [[Appraisal gaps can make your offer more competitive]]. 

It's important to highlight your advantages when writing an offer letter. If you're pre-approved for a mortgage, you're waiving certain contingencies, or if you're putting a large percentage down, make sure to mention it.
