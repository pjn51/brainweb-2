*Make sure to see an inspection before buying property.* This can be one that you pay for, which will create a post-offer contingency ([[There are multiple contingencies to protect you when buying a home]]), or this can be an inspection that the seller has provided.

Make sure that you're aware of anything that will have to be replaced or repaired in the property.
