*Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization.* When we construct categories before seeing the [[data]], we're only able to detect patterns that we're already aware of. However, [[All classification is approximation]] and [[We're only as intelligent as we need to be]]. We're guaranteed to be at least somewhat incorrect about the patterns in the data. 

This is one reason why [[A Zettelkasten can act as a thinking partner]]. The [[zettelkasten method]] relies on emergent connections between ideas in order to spark novel insights. 

In a certain way, this idea contradicts the standard advice to [[Begin projects with a use-case]]. Having a use case in mind when you start a project locks you in to finding a solution for a problem that you know you have. Really powerful tools end up solving problems that you don't even know you have yet ([[There are known knowns...]]). This is one benefit of [[unsupervised learning]] ([[Unsupervised learning detects emergent associations]]). 

This is a concept that I should keep in mind when deciding: [[What's the best way to organize a budget?]]

Ahrens argues that this applies very well to choosing a topic to write about: don't set out with a thesis in mind, set out from your ideas and notes, and then develop a thesis out of that. [1]
