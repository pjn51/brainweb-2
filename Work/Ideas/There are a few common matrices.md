*There are a few common [[matrices]].* These include the identity matrix, the zero matrix, the square matrix, the symmetric matrix, and the diagonal matrix. 

The identity matrix has ones along the main diagonal, with all other elements zero. This matrix doesn't transform the unit vectors when applied to them.

The symmetric matrix can be flipped (transposed) without changing elements.

The diagonal matrix is like the identity matrix, but not necessarily ones on the main diagonal.

The square matrix and zero matrix are self-explanatory.
