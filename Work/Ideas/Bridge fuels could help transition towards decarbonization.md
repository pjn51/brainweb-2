# Bridge fuels could help transition towards decarbonization. 
The idea is that a bridge fuel might not be perfect, but it would be a hell of a lot better than the mainly coal-based system that the world uses today. 

I think that it's possible that [[Nuclear power has potential as a bridge fuel]] because of its efficiency when built and its proven ability to scale.
