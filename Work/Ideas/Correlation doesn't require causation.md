# Correlation doesn't require causation.
We cannot infer causal relationships between variables just based on the fact that they are associated with one another.

For example, the number of resturants increases as the distance to the ocean decreases, but it would be foolish to posit that closeness to water causes resturants to appear. Both are caused by the higher population density nearer to coastlines.
