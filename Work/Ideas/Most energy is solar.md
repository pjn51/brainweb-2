# Most energy is solar. 
Fundamentally, most energy on Earth came from the Sun at one point or another. All organic life developed from the basis of photosynthesis or predation of photosynthetic life, and all non-geothermal heat is from the sun. 

The only force that I can think of that isn't caused by the sun would be things caused by gravity, such as tides.
