# Closed source software is socially inefficient.
When code is open sourced, developers can take advantage of code that has already been written, and aren't forced to repeat the work of others ([[Don't repeat yourself when coding]]). However, when it is not, there are untold hours of labor wasted as parallel teams work on the same problems. 

This is the computer science reflection of how [[Capitalism limits cooperation]].
