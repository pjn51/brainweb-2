*Begin projects with a use-case.* When working on [[data science]] projects, or any projects really, start with an end user and a use-case in mind. 

While we may be tempted to start by looking at what data we have on hand or thinking of what techniques would be fun to use, such thinking is disconnected from the real world, and therefore academic in a certain way. 

Instead, by beginning with an end result in mind, we can keep our projects as simple as possible, remembering that [[Complexity must be justified]]. 

However, this idea is contradicted by how [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]]. When we set out with a specific use case, we should try to avoid limiting the applications of whatever we develop.
