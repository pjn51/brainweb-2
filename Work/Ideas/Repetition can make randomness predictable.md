*Repetition can make randomness predictable.* The [[average]] result of random processes will often converge over many trials. For example, if we roll a die once, we cannot predict the outcome. However, if we roll a die 1,000 times, we can be confident that the average result will be 3.5. 

As time goes on, the random quality of a single trial results in a predictable average result. In this way, [[Opposites require each other]]!
