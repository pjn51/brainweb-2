*Review dates on for-sale houses reveal seller expectations.* When you see a house that has a review date, that means the seller is going to wait until a certain date until looking at all the offers that have been submitted.

A seller may be attempting to generate a multiple offer scenario where they can choose from among a variety of competing offers. This strategy often goes hand-in-hand with presenting a relatively low asking price as another method of attracting multiple offers. 

Keep in mind that [[There are strategies to make offers more competitive in the housing market]], and you should consider the possibility of a competitive situation when you see a review date.
