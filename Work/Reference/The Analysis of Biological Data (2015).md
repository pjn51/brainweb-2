# Summary
This is a textbook that I was assigned as part of my biostatistics course at [[WWU]]. It deals with, as the title suggests, the analysis of biological [[data]] via [[statistics|statistical]] means.

The authors define statistics as the "study of methods to describe and measure aspects of nature from samples" (1). Over the course of this book, the main question is: [[How can we estimate population characteristics?]]

The text defines *bias* as "a systematic discrepancy between the estimates we would obtain, if we could sample a population again and again, and the true population characteristic" (6). 

Describing the history of statistics, the authors say the field grew out of the application of probability to [[evolution||evolutionary]] [[biology]] (23). 

The authors explain that the relative frequency distribution is a useful way to represent data, and that it describes the fraction of occurences of each value of a variable across the dataset (30). They elaborate, saying that a histogram visualizes such a distribution (33). 

The authors explain that [[Correlation doesn't require causation]] (201).
