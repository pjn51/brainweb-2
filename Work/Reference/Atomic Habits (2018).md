This book has a surprisingly accurate description of mass movements:

> **Outrage compounds.** Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event. Instead, a long series of microagressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.

This is actually an application of the [[dialectics|dialectical]] law that [[Quantity transforms into quality]]. 

Clear talks about the idea of *habit stacking,* where we can attach new habits to existing habits. For example, we can say, "After I brush my teeth, I will read for ten minutes." He highlights the fact that this automatically creates a powerful cue for our new habit (__).
