We will go through three levels of understanding when it comes to the [[naive bayes]] theorem. We want to know what the theorem is saying, why the theorem is true, and when the theorem is useful.

For example, take the case of Steve. If we are told that Steve likes to keep to himself, prefers order and neatness, would you say that Steve is more likely to be a librarian, or a farmer?

Most would say that he is a librarian. Nearly everyone fails to take into account the fact that farmers outnumber librarians nearly 20 to 1! This is the fact that the naive bayes theorem takes into account.

We should use this theorem whenever we have a hypothesis and we get new evidence. The theorem can determine if the hypothesis still holds.

The theorem can be visualized like this. The basic idea is to consider the amont of observations of A versus B, and the probability of A having characteristic X, and the probability of B having characteristic X when we are trying to find probability if A vs B given X.
