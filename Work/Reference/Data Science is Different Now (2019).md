The author asks us what we think of when the term [[data science]] is mentioned. She suspects we imagine some combination of [[statistics]], [[machine learning]], [[deep learning]], and other sophisticated tools. She says that this is the narrative that she believed when she entered the field as a data analyst. 

Now as a data scientist, Boykis says that she's seen the field go through every stage in the Garnter hype cycle between 2012 and 2019.

She says that we've been through a early adoption phase, through negative press waves about AI bias, and now we're at the point where Fortune 100 companies that tend to move five years behind the market are now hiring for data scientists. 

Boykis notes that unfortunately, the media is still hyping the field beyond that which is reasonable. She argues that because of this, there is now a glut of junior data scientists eager to enter the field, with incorrect expectations.

## Glut of new data scientists
Based on the author's anecdotal experience, the number of applicants for [[data science]] positions has increased from around 20 per job to over 100 per job. She admits that it's hard to determine the mismatch between supply and demand, but notes that there are around 10,000 vacancies for data science positions, with over 100,000 people currently enrolled in bootcamps. 

Boykis cites other studies that generally show that the opportunities in the [[data science industry]] are rapidly shrinking for junior data scientists. 

## Data science as a misleading job requirement
Boykis notes that many junior data scientists think that they will be doing machine learning, deep learning, and Bayesian simulations, while they're more likely to be moving data around and cleaning it. Basically, she says [[data wrangling]] is the main focus of the day-to-day work. 

The author states that the really important skills now are to be able to clean data and put models into production, rather than build ML algorithms from scratch. She says that this indicates that data science is moving closer and closer to engineering.

Because of this, Boykis argues, software engineering skills are more and more valuable to data scientists, and we have seen the rise of the "machine learning engineer" job title. 

## Advice to new data scientists
She says that she would offer two pieces of advice for anyone trying to get into the data science field these days:

1. Don't shoot for a data science job
2. Be prepared for most of your data scientist work to not be data science. Adjust your skillset for that.

She says that these seem bleak, but hopefully won't appear that grim upon further inspection.

### Don't get into data science
Boykis advises us to avoid competing for entry level data science roles, and not to go for a bootcamp or a degree in data science. Instead, she advises us to come in through the back door, as a junior developer or in DevOps, project management, or through data analysis.

If we do this, she assures us, we will make moves towards the illustrious "data scientist" title, while building useful skills.

### Learn the skills needed for data science today
Boykis lists eleven key skills that she thinks every data scientist really needs to know. She also includes other blog posts to read on each subject (which would be worth checking out later):
 
1. Creating python [[modules and packages]]
2. Putting [[R]] in production
3. Optimizing [[Spark]] jobs so they run more efficiently
4. Version controlling data
5. Making models and data reproducible
6. Version controlling SQL
7. Building and maintaining clean data in [[data]] lakes
8. Tooling for time series forecasting at scale
9. Scaling sharing of [[Jupyter Notebook]]
10. Thinking about systems for clean data
11. Lots of JSON

She says that what all these skills have in common is dealing with data. She says we need good generalist engineering skills with a data background. 

### 1. Learn [[SQL]]
Boykis recommends learning SQL since it's useful for lots and lots of fields in the tech industry. She says that SQL is inescapable if we want to extract the right data from a [[database]].

### 2. Learn a programming language extremely well and learn programming concepts
Boykis notes that SQL is technically a [[programming language]], but it's declarative. She instructs us to learn a procedural language, like [[Python]] or [[R]]. 

Boykis tells us that we can choose from a variety of languages, but she recommends Python for its breadth. 

### 3. Learn how to work in the cloud
The author says that there's a really good chance that we will have to work in the cloud at some point, and that it's important for us to have these skills. 

She states that chances are we will work with AWS, [[GCP]], or Azure. In order to do this, she argues we should understand [[JSON]], how to logically partition our work, and how to glue services together. 

Boykis says that she isn't a big beliver in the value of certifications, but says that the certifications offered by these cloud services might be a good way to get a headstart on understanding them. 

The author also emphasizes that soft skills like communication, and knowing when to use what tools, is just as important as what she's covered above, but we need to do our own reading on that. 

## Last steps
Boykis says that if any or all of this seems interesting, this field is a good fit for us. She also gives us a small pep talk, saying that everyone who got into this field had to go through the same process of learning these skills. 

She tells us to avoid analysis paralysis. By this, she means the fact that when presented with so many things to do, we can become paralyzed. Instead, she wants us to take things one at a time.

She recommends the book *Bird by Bird,* about the process of writing. She says that the title comes from a story of a boy who had to write a report about a variety of birds, and was only able to succeed by taking things one bird at a time.
