# 1. Introduction
This article explains its central question: [[How does the internet work?]]

# 2. Where to begin? Internet addresses
The article explains that every computer has a unique IP address. 

# 3. Protocol stacks and packets
Shuler says that [[Computers interface with the internet via their protocol stack]], and that [[Data is sent across the internet in packets]]. 

# 4. Networking infrastructure
After leaving one computer, the author says, packets travel through a modem and a series of routers that connect with the ISP backbone. 

# 5. Internet infrastructure
Shuler explains that local ISPs connect to regional ISPs, and then to NSPs (network service providers) which interface with one another at **network access points (NAPs)** and **metropolitan area exchanges (MAEs).** 

# 6. Domain names and address resolution
If we want to connect with computers that we don't know the IP address of, the author explains, if we know the domain name, we can use DNS (domain name service). [[DNS converts between domain name and IP address]]. 

# 8. Application protocols: HTTP and the World Wide Web
HTTP stands for *hypertext transfer protocol*, and the article explains that this is the protocol that makes the World Wide Web (WWW) work.
