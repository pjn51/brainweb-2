> In this blog post, Tiago Forte explains the basics of the [[PARA]] system for information organization.

Tiago argues that he's come up with a universal, flexible, simple organizational system, and calles it *PARA,* standing for "projects, areas, resources, archive."

He defines projects as series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline; areas as spheres of activity with standards to be maintained; resources as topics or themes of interest; archives as inactive items from the other three categories.

He explains the hierarchy of these categories - areas are made up of projects, which are in turn made up of tasks. He clarifies that projects have end dates, while areas usually don't. 

The author motivates the distinction by saying that combining the two prevents us from understanding the extent of our commitments. Tiago also notes that we wouldn't be able to connect current efforts to long term projects, and we can't measure our progress in *areas* rather than *projects*.

Tiago explains that PARA operates according to three key principles:
1. Magic number four
2. Mirror tasks/project management
3. Seperate actionable from non-actionable

First up, he argues that we should limit our structures to four categories wide and four deep, so that we can keep all the categories in our working memory. He says that we can really only keep four distinct things in our mind at once.
