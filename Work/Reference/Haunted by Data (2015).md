> [!Introduction]
> This is the text version of a talk given by Pinboard.in founder Maciej Ceglowski at the Strata + Hadoop World Conference in 2015.

The author argues that we should view [[data]] not as a pristine resource, but as "a bunch of radioactive, toxic sludge that we don't know how to handle" (PDF, 1).

> In a world where everything is tracked and kept forever, like the world we're for some reason building, you become hostage to the worst thing you've ever done.
>    
> Whoever controls that data has power over you, whether or not they exercise it. And yet we treat this data with the utmost carelessness, as if it held no power at all (2). 

Maciej quotes former [[CIA]] director Hayden, who said that "we kill people based on [[metadata]]" to underscore the importance of data (3). 

The author believes that since information is power, we can never separate the positive from the negative uses of information, and therefore, there's no way to prevent mass collection from becoming mass surveilance (4). 

Turning to the data industry, Marciej argues that on the data collection side, workers are told to just throw data in there, and the fancy algorithms will deal with it. However, he continues, on the programming side, engineers are told "don't worry about what the algorithms are really doing, the data is training them the right way." He thinks this is a bit of a con (5). 

Marciej turns to an allegory from the pharma industry. He explains that they operate by "Eroom's Law" (Moore's law spelled backwards), and that every nine years, the number of drugs discovered per billions of dollars invested has dropped by half. He thinks that this is related to their attempt to apply a data-driven approach to a vastly complicated system, where iterative approximation would be a better idea (5-6). 

The author turns to a different example of the limitations of data. He says that when you try and measure productivity, workers will attempt to circumvent these measures, and what was once an attempt to measure has become a power relation. Instead of getting us closer to reality, he argues, this measurement has distorted our perceptions further (7).

He coins a term for what he sees as an issue here: the "Jetsons fallacy," the idea that we can transform the world technologically without changing human behavior (7). I think that's noteworthy - [[Technological transformation changes behavior]]. 

Marciej proposes some rules to follow: first of all, just don't collect data you don't need. Second, he says, if you have to collect it, don't store it. He wants us to think of data in terms of sampling and flows to be discareded, rather than stocks or mines of data. Finally, he says, if we must store it, get rid of it as soon as possible (9)!

In conclusion, [[Marciej predicts data meltdown]], calling the current mass collection + eternal warehousing status quo unsustainable (10).
