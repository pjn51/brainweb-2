# 22-06-16 PQM standup
on [[22-06-16 Thu]]
with [[Product Quality Measurement|PQM]]

---
This is the first standup that I'm attending. Everyone takes turns giving a short overview of tickets they've been working on. People raise their hands to indicate they're ready to talk. They use lots of acronyms that I don't understand ðŸ˜…  I talked, explaining that I'm just working through the onboarding stuff that will hopefully be done by EOD today.
