I'm learning a lot about [[Waldo]], [[Labeler]], and the processes that the [[Trust & Safety]] team is using for account level and job level moderation. I've completed the labeler exercise that Dan gave me, which we'll review next week. Doing the second-week knowlege assessment this afternoon, and heading into more training next week.
