# One on One
on [[22-06-15 Wed]]
with [[Syed]]

---
- Ask about truework registration time (kind of urgent)
	- Reach out to HR person Destiny Kees
	- compensation@indeed.com can help me maybe. 
- Explain that I'm about 60% done with onboarding checklists, should be finished by the start of next week
- Meeting types
	- Product Quality Measurement - Biweekly: the biweekly presentation meeting that we center our work around. Everything we do is towards this meeting. 
	- Quarterly planning meetings
- He says I should expect two months of total confusion
- I must complete the onboarding checklists by EOD Monday
- There's a good amount of self-help stuff that I can start working on
- Anything that's more than 10min of work should be a ticket
	- People will try and get me to do work for them, make them submit tickets so it counts towards my points per sprint
- Points
	- *Not* based on time, based on difficulty. 
	- We should try breaking high-point tickets into multiple smaller ones. 
- Capstone
	- I will actually work on and submit a ticket for my final training
