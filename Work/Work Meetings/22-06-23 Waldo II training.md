# Waldo II training
on [[22-06-23 Thu]]
with [[Shane]]

---
In this meeting, Shane walked me through another overview of the way that [[Waldo]] works. 

First up, we discussed the difference between visibility and analysis rules.  Visibility rules change the [[visibility]] of a job, while analysis rules are just used for people to be able to examine patterns and trends in the job [[data]]. 

I saw on the Waldo dasboard that there are over 140,000 rules that change the visibility of jobs. I asked how those rules are audited, and Shane said that there's a Rule Health team that does that, seeking to combine rules efficiently and remove old rules that aren't needed any longer. 

We talked a little bit about the difference between filters and rules. Shane gave me the impression that filters are simply more efficient than rules, because there are lots of ways that a job could end up in a filter, so rather than creating ten rules for ten cases, we can just put them all into a filter and then apply a single rule to the filter. 

We turned to a discussion of tags. My understanding is that moderators tag jobs through their decisions withn [[Labeler]], and those tags associate them with filters or rules. I was interested in hearing if jobs were ever automatically tagged, and Shane advised me to ask [[Syed]] about that. 

Shane turned to the topic of de-duplication. He said that there are a few tools that find duplicates and erase their visibility, but the program takes five or six hours to undo that erasure from false-positives.
