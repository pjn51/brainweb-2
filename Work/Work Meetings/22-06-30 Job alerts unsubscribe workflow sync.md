# Job alerts unsubscribe workflow sync
on [[22-06-30 Thu]]
with [[Brian]], [[Zandra]], [[Dan]], [[Janie]]

This meeting was a sync between the [[Measurement & Tools|M&T]] team and other stakeholders, where our team recommended a new [[Labeler]] workflow to make better use of the user feedback related to people unsubscribing from job alert emails. 

The stakeholder from the jobalerts team said their team has been stuck firefighting for a while, and hasn't been able to get much done otherwise. However, her vision is that the team could dedicate more resources to "feed alert", a newsletter based on user [[SERP]] rather than a static search.
