# 22-06-15 dev env setup
on [[22-06-15 Wed]]
with [[Dylan]]

Their setup procesure is totally automated, so I just need to run the following script in terminal. 

```
curl -L [https://boxy.sandbox.indeed.net/bootstrap](https://boxy.sandbox.indeed.net/bootstrap) > /tmp/system-setup ; bash /tmp/system-setup
```

I need to keep my computer on for a few hours while it runs. Can't do this until I have [[VPN]] access. 

When it prompts me to enter my team, ours isn't listed so just hit Enter. 

It will give me access to [[Kerberos]], and I can use this [guide](https://indeed.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/kb_view.do%3Fsysparm_article%3DKB0011115) after I have VPN access. This is necessary for me to request data and run scripts. It's a way to identify and permission computers.
