# RSU info session
on [[22-06-27 Mon]]
with Tax, Payroll, and Equity teams

This meeting, led by the Deloitte tax team, provided a high level overview of the tax implications of supplemental income such as [[restricted stock unit|RSUs]]. 

We covered the basic RSU life cycle, which consists of three events: Grant date, vest date, and sale date. 

1. First of all, we are granted a set amount of RSUs. At this time, we don't own them, and therefore have no tax obligation or liability. 
2. At each vesting date, a portion of the RSUs will become shares of Recruit Holding stock. At this point, [[Indeed]] will withhold a percentage of the fair-market value in order to pay for income, medicare, and other taxes. If the total value of the supplemental income is less than $1 million, 22% of the FMV will be withheld for these taxes.
3. When you sell a share, you will have to pay [[capital gains tax]] on your profits, if there are any.
