# Standup
on [[22-07-18 Mon]]
with [[Measurement|PQM]]

Me: making sure tickets are lined up for this sprint, continuing [[IQL - From Beginner to Intermediate]], and starting to work on the [[Midapply Feedback queue]] [[Cronjob]] which is very exciting! Need to give more info to the Data Platform Engineering team to get access to [[Kerberos]], going to be working on my other tickets until that blocker is removed.
