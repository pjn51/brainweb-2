# Feedback effort consolidation
on [[22-07-19 Tue]]
with [[Job Seeker Operations]]

---
This was a round-table discussion between various JS OPS teams discussing what the current challenges are related to user feedback.

First, we heard that Indeed Flex actually isn't keeping track of user feedback in a centralized way, and their [[data]] is totally isolated from the rest of the company. There was some discussion on integrating their data into an [[IQL indices|IQL index]]. 

[[Dan]] and [[Megan]] explained that somebody is messing with the UI for RAJ, and emphasized that the UI team needs to reach out before doing that, because it effects downstream processes. Megan also said that she's interested in seeing how the new location policies affect various queries.

Related to apply feedback, Dan said that he's been maintaining a dashboard that shows spikes in user feedback, and has passed it off to a Job Seeker Success team that will monitor it. He mentioned that it's a big goal to get an [[IQL]] index going for [[Midapply Feedback queue]] this sprint, which is what [[Josh]] and I are working on right now.
