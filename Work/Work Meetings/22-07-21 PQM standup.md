Syed explained that there was some kind of entry-level [[Indeed]] support position that just opened up over the weekend, and they got over 20,000 applications! People remarked that there must be something going wrong here for an individual listing to have so many impressions. It's honestly too much to even sift through successfully. 

I told the crew that I'm basically stomping through the [[Midapply Feedback queue]] [[Cronjob]], which has been challenging since I still don't have [[Kerberos]] access, meaning that I can't test any of my code.
