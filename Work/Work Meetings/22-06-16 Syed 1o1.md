- Update on the auto dev env script
- Update on onboarding (finished [[introducing indeed course]], 75% done with [[JS Ops onboarding course]])

From the [[JS Ops onboarding course]]:
> Ask your manager how your team works with Jira tickets. What project do we use for tickets? Is the project in Bugs or Mechabugs? Does our team utilize a dashboard and/or a Kanban board to manage tickets?
 
- We use bugs
- We use kanban and scrum
	- Scrum is the big day-to-day one
- Every now and then I can have a ticket roll over. If it becomes common, that's an issue
- At the start of the sprint, you will know most of the stuff you'll be working on. However, there will be additional things added during the sprint. 
- Spike tickets: shooting in the dark by blocking out some time for investigation.
