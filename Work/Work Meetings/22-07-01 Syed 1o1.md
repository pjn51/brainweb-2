- Questions
	- ~~Where did that google doc for our one-on-ones go~~
	- How much of the Orc stuff do I need to know?
	- Can I dedicate some time to looking into NLP applications for RAJ verbatim?
	- ~~Do we have monday off?~~
	- How are tasks supposed to be managed? Is there a way for me to make my own personal boards / task lists in [[JIRA]]?
- User feedback meetings
	- Might see lots of them, I should go to as many as possible for Q3
	- Figure out how the vendor system works
- OKR sheet
	- my name is all over, don't pay attention to that
- first project
	- automating an ishbook thru [[Orc]] 
- JIRA hygene will be part of my performance review (its important!!!)
	- [[Dan]] writes good tickets
	- "component" will be measurement (that's my team)
	- Scrum vs kanban
		- kanban is a roadmap, not sprint-based
		- scrum is used by engineers, we technically follow a scrumban framework
	- What tickets should I make?
		- next sprint I'll work on the midapply feedback ishbook into production as a cron. I should make a spike ticket for that *this sprint.* and another ticket for learning about cron. five points each
		- Cutoff time is that the sprint runs from the planning day until noon cst on the next planning day
