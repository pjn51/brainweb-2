# My questions
- Next week I'm going to have to miss the Q3 brainstorming on Thurs. Is that recurring or just once? That time conflicts with telehealth. 
- Should I be paying attention to all these emails I'm getting? They seem to be related to [[visibility]] issues that clients are having. How much of our work is related to handling those issues? 
- Purpose of Waldo tags, any automation here?
