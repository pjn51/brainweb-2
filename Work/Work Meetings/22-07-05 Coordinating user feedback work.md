# Coordinating user feedback work
on [[22-07-05 Tue]]
with [[Dan]], [[Megan]]

This was a short meeting where Dan, Megan, and I discussed who I should reach out to in regards to the user feedback analysis that I'm going to be responsible for. 

Dan said that my main priority should be to get familiar with [[IQL indices|IQL index]] builders, [[CRON job|CRON jobs]], and the way that sampling is done. He said that this is a substantial amount of work, but the pipelines for various lanes of user feedback are quite similar, so once I understand one the rest will come easier.

They both advised me to reach out to [[Lynn]], who they said was able to conduct deep dives into various [[PM queues]] rather quickly.

They said that it was probably good for me to learn about the [[MidApply Feedback queue]] first, as it was less complex than the [[Report A Job|RAJ]] one. I've been invited to some recurring vendor calibration meetings, where vendors are able to bring up confusing documents and ask questions.

Megan said that she could show me her RAJ deepdives, and mentioned that a big priority should be figuring out who can benefit from these queues. For instance, she said the [[SERP Relrating queue]] is kind of unloved.

It seems like the bulk of my effort will be figuring out who owns what, where the documentation is, and who would benefit from what [[data]]. I'm basically going to be grabbing data from one place in the company, looking at it, and delivering insights to another stakeholder across the company. 

Dan sent me some vendor guidelines for the midapply queue. ^1
