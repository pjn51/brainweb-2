# M&T team meeting
on [[22-07-06 Wed]]
with [[Measurement & Tools]] 

---
This is my first meeting with [[Maitreyi]], Syed's manager. She walked the team through an updated [[Indeed org chart]], explaining that our team used to be part of [[Trust & Safety]], but now we're an independent team within [[Job Seeker Operations]]. This means that we should proactively try to help out all the teams under that umbrella. She pointed out the Targeting & Personalization team within M&T, which I kind of forgot about.

[[Syed]] noted that the report listing what bonuses everyone is getting comes out tomorrow. I'm not expecting to get a bonus since I'm so new, but I will follow up with him about it.
