This is a sprint planning meeting. Syed briefly went over a quote about MVP protocol, and then the team discussed the upcoming sprint. They noted that there's a documentation day on the 23rd, and all tickets and epics should be closed as this sprint ends today at noon. 

There wasn't really anything for me to weigh in on, and I barely understood what people were talking about, so I just sat back and listened.
