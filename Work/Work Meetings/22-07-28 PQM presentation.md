# PQM presentation
on [[22-07-28 Thu]]
with [[Measurement]], stakeholders

[[Brian]] and [[Josh]] are giving this presentation of the [[bad match rate]] recently within the [[Job to Query queue]], highlighting the very bad match rate, termed the "WTF match" rate.

The general BMR between May and July was around 16% globally, it was around 11% for the US english market.

They dove into the top 100 queries in terms of search volume, and found the ones with the highest BMR. 

Somebody asked how we're validating that vendor guidelines actually reflect user preferences, and suggested that we could leverage dislikes or some other metric of satisfaction.

Another person asked how the taxonomic team (responsible for job classification) is investigating bad taxonomic matches. Another person responded that there's a [[PM queues|PM queue]] that's used to do this, which regularly reveals 90% accuracy. 

However, one flaw that the same person pointed out is that there's really no language detection going on at [[Indeed]] whatsoever. He said that in certain multi-lingual markets this isn't an issue, but it's a big issue in other places.
