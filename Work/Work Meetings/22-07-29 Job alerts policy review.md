# Job alerts policy review
on [[22-07-29 Fri]]
with [[Megan]], [[Brian]], [[Zandra]], Lisa

---
This was a meeting with some representatives from [[Measurement]] and a stakeholder on the Job Alerts team, Lisa. We explained that our team is working on a new and improved workflow for the labeling of verbatim user feedback within [[Labeler]], as well as a new format for the buckets.

We will be following up on this to ensure that the new buckets really make sense.
