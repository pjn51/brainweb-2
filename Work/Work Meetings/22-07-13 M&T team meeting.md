# M&T team meeting
on [[22-07-13 Wed]]
with [[Measurement & Tools]]

---
During this week's team meeting, [[Maitreyi]] explained that she's finally gotten a new roof, and [[Dylan]] and [[Kevin]] said they're planning to do a live cooking show in a few weeks, which seems like fun. Dylan also mentioned that the first D&D session is happening this Friday. 

Maitreyi said that new rubrics are being developed for the Technical Analyst positions company-wide, which are supposed to be released by the next review cycle.

During the standup portion, I said that I'm wrapping up my two tickets and I'm excited to actually be creating a [[CRON job]] from [[Dan|Dan's]] [[Ishbook]] next sprint. I'm attending vendor calibrations for the [[MidApply Feedback queue]] so that I understand what the process is like, and I'm diving into [[Orc]] to round out my [[4607 - Learn how to write a Cronjob]] ticket.
