# No Red Flags training

In this meeting, Andrew and I went through some of the details of the moderation decisions that moderators make on an account-by-account basis. 

# No red flags (NRF)
Of course, when presented with a report, a moderator can mark an account as verified or rejected, but they can also submit a decision of "no red flags." This is basically saying that the account hasn't done anything visibly nefarious here, but we want to keep an eye on them in the future. 

Unlike passing a judgetment of "verified," NRF will still allow the account to get sent into the moderation queue again if it re-triggers something. This was developed after it was discovered that scammers tended to wait until their accounts were verified before starting the fraud. This option lets jobs go live while we're still watching the account for bad activity. 

NRF can only be selected three times by a moderator before a final decision needs to be made regarding the account. 

# General moderation trends
There are some high-risk job titles that have been seen. These tend to be entry-level jobs who many applicants feel they are qualified for, and they tend to be jobs that are always hiring and apply to many areas of the country. For instance, "package handler" is going to be more suspicious than "expert deep sea fisher." 

There are some hoops that verified accounts must jump through if they're going to be verified before sitting in NRF status for a little bit (three decisions). They have to have non-generic emails (no gmail accounts), they can't have high risk titles, new domains, or high risk flags. 

There are times where triggers or [[Waldo]] rules get messed up, and become too sensitive or outright broken. When this happens, companies have had their accounts suspended or put into queue purgatory, never to escape. 

Andrew also let me know that if I'm looking for [[data]] related to moderation, the Moderation Strategy team would be the people to talk to.
