Today is the first day of the 07/05 - 07/18 sprint (see [[22-07 July#üèÉ1Ô∏è‚É£]]) so we have to review what everyone will be working on, and do a retrospective for the previous sprint, which I wasn't really part of. 

I have two tickets this sprint, which add up to ten points. I mentioned that I'm taking four days off this sprint, and we have two holidays (the 4th and a You Day). That means I only have four workdays to close these tickets. I feel like it's doable, but I'm glad I put that out there.

[[Syed]] went over the Q3 OKRs, explaining that at first glance there's a ton going on in this google sheet. However, he said, we shouldn't feel overwhelmed and should instead look at this sheet as a source of documentation and resources. [[Zandra]] added that there are lots of impact opportunities here.

Syed also covered PTO guidelines again, since there are lots of people taking time off. He said that we should ask an active coworker to cover our [[Cronjob|CRON jobs]] so that there's a point person available for solving issues. 

Turning to my tickets specifically, he said that they really go hand in hand, I should be able to get them done despite my PTO. 

As for the retro, apparently a survey revealed that [[Indeed]] employees feel that there are too many meetings. He said that we should feel free to ask for clarification when invited to meetings that don't seem related to our work. He explained that he's twice sat with a manager to pare down his calendar and remove unnecessary meetings, to good effect. [[Zandra]] added that if there's no agenda provided, we should ask for one to be provided so that we don't waste time.
