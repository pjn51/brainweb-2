# Maintaining team docs
on [[22-07-13 Wed]]
with [[Katie]]

---
In this meeting, Katie and I went over the procedures for documenting activities and tools within [[Measurement & Tools]]. The main platforms for this are confluence and [[GitLab]]. 

Within PTE (?) we use confluence for general knowledge storage. However, it isn't always up-to-date across teams, so we should be conscious of the date that it was last edited. Within this platform, we can create new pages from templates or we can edit existing pages. This is a good place to look for info about [[internal Indeed tools]] and [[Python]] [[modules and packages]]. 

We also discussed "documentation days," which happen once a month. The team schedules some time to update existing documentation, tracked on a google sheet. Within this sheet, we can see the backlog of pages and repos that need updates. The next documentation day is next Friday, [[22-07-22 Fri]]. ^2

Katie also reminded me that keeping up with [[JIRA]] is a big part of good doocumentation. She linked example epics with good documentation. ^3

She explained that epics tend to have more in-depth descriptions than individual tickets. 

She also provided a great document with lots of links to documentation sources. ^1
