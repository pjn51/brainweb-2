# PQM standup
on [[22-07-14 Thu]]
with [[Measurement]]

In this standup, I said that I'm reviewing the Midapply Ishbook with Dan later today, and after that I'll be able to close out all my remaining tickets. Then I'm going to be working on drafting some for the next sprint, where I'll actually be making a Cronjob which is exciting.

I heard that [[Josh]] is writing the downstream [[MidApply Feedback queue]] [[Cronjob]], so I should keep it in mind.
