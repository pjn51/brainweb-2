As an [[Indeed]] TA, I want to keep a centralized place for my unanswered questions.

[[22-06-22 Wed]]:  It seems like I got a different answer for the same [[IQL]] query between an [[Ishbook]] and the web app. What's up? Here's the [Link to web query](https://squall.indeed.com/iqlweb/#q[]=from%20jobsearch%202015-07-01%202015-07-31%20where%20STANDARD_FILTERS(grp%20!%3D%20'privileged'%2C%20grp%20!%3D%20'spider'%2C%20rcv%20%3D%20'jsv')%20js_ip_country_code%20%3D%20'gb'%20group%20by%20js_ip_country_code&author=pnorman&createTimestamp=1656541676&view=table) and the [Link to Ishbook query](https://ishbook-editor.big.k8s.indeed.tech/notebooks/55222#).
