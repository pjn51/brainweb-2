# Summary Statistics
---
There are two fundamental measures of a dataset: the *central tendency* and the *variability.*

## Central tendency
The central tendency can be expressed by the *mean,* the *median,* or the *mode.* Note that the [[Central tendency metric depends on data type]]. 

Arithmetic mean (the [[average]]) refers to the arithmetic average of a group of values. 
$$\text{mean} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}$$
The [[median]] refers to the middle value when the values are ordered. 

The [[mode]] is the most common single value within the data. 

## Variability / dispersion
This refers to how spread out around the central tendency a dataset is. 
Variance, $S^2$ refers to the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. 
$$ S^2 = \frac{\sum{x_i - \bar{x}}^2}{n-1} $$
[[standard deviation]], $S$, is the square root of the variance. 

$$ S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{x_i - \bar{x}}^2}{n-1}} $$
# Method depending on data type
[[Central tendency metric depends on data type]]. 

In nominal data, the **mode** is the central tendency. 
For ordinal data, the **median** is the central tendency. 
For interval data, we can use the **mean** as the central tendency.
