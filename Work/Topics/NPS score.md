# NPS score
---
The NPS score, or net promoter score, is a number from -100 to +100 that measures the willingness of customers / users to recommend a company's products to others. 

At [[Indeed]], we use the NPS score to quantify the satisfaction of both jobseekers and employers. Users are prompted to enter a score from 0 to 10. Those who enter 9+ are categorized as *promoters*, those entering between 7-8 as *passives,* and those with a score less than 7 as *detractors.* 

Users are prompted for comments after they leave a score, and a sample of these comments are labeled as part of the [[Job Seeker NPS queue]].
