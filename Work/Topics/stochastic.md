# Stochastic

---
In [[probability]], a process is stochastic if it is well described by a random distribution. The words *stochastic* and *random* are often used interchangeable, but they're technically different. Stochastic refers to a [[modeling]] technique to approximate the real world while randomness describes the real world itself.
