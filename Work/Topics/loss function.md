# Loss Function
---
The loss function of a [[machine learning]] [[modeling|model]] is used to "grade" how well the model is performing its task. We can use this [[function]] to perform [[gradient descent]] and optimize the model. Thus it can be thought of as the [[metrics|metric]] used for model optimization.  

We can guard against overfitting by adding a [[regularization]] term to the loss function. This works since [[Regularization punishes model sensitivity]].
