# The Logistic Function
`TAGS`: #equation 

---
$$
f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}}
$$

- $x_0$ = the $x$ value of the sigmoid's midpoint
- $L$ = the curve's maximum value
- $k$ = the logistic growth rate (aka steepness of the curve)

# Introduction
A logistic function is a common S-shaped ([[sigmoid]]) curve. For a logistic curve between zero and one, centered at an $x$ value of zero, the equation would be simplified to the *standard logistic function:*

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$

# Applications
In [[environmental science]], we can use this function to model population growth. 

In [[statistics]] and [[machine learning]], we can use this function for various purposes. We can use a [[logistic regression]] algorithm, or we can use the logistic function as an activiation function for a [[neural network]].
