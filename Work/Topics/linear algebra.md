# Linear Algebra

---
This is a field of math that studies sets of equations and their transformational properties. We can use these tools to break up complicated problems into simple ones, and allow us to understand multidimensional data space. 

Linear algebra can be understood numerically and geometrically. We need to understand them numerically to actually carry out the operations such as cross product or finding the determinant. But we also need to understand these ideas geometrically in order to know when to apply them, and what these concepts actually mean. 

## What is linear algebra???
This is math studying linear sets of equations and their transformational properties. We’re talking about groups of equations and how they can be changed. 

Linear: we’ll be talking about linear, or straight, relationships. We won’t be getting into anything more complicated than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This can sort of be thought about as geometric algebra. 
Linear algebra is very old. Like 10th century BCE old. 

We need linear algebra in order to break up complicated problems into simple ones. It also allows us to approximate nonlinear systems. It helps us explore and understand multidimensional data space, and visualize these kinds of systems and models. 

## Linear algebra for [[data science]]
It is a valuable tool because we will have to work often with large datasets with many predictive features that can’t easily be visualized. Once we get the data into a setup where it’s just a [[scalars and vectors|vector]] in n-dimensional space, we can operate on this dataset using linear algebra to support vector machines, compress images, use ranking, and do lots of [[machine learning]] algorithms.

## [[modules and packages|Packages]] for linear algebra
`Scipy.linalg` and `numpy.linalg` are both modules built for linear algebra. 

`Scipy.linalg` is a little better in terms of the number of functions and functionality.
