# MidApply Feedback queue
---
The MidApply Feedback queue is a [[PM queues|PM queue]] that measures jobseeker satisfaction during the application and interview process. This is only active when a listing uses Indeed Apply and hosts interviews on Indeed.

This is a relatively new queue, having been launched in 2022 Q2. 

I'm going to be productionizing the [[Ishbook]] used for [[Labeler]] population as part of [[4606 - SPIKE Midapply feedback Labeler Cronjob|SQMEASURE - 4606]].
