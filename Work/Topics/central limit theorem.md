# Introduction
In [[probability]], the central limit theorem, or CLT, is the theorem that when independent random variables are added, their normalized sum tends towards a [[normal distribution]] even when the original variables are not normally distributed. In other words, [[The sum of many indepenent, random values tends towards a normal distribution]]. 

This theorem expands the uses for statistical and probabilistic methods that only work for normal distributions.
