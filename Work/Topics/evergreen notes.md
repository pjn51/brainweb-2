# Evergreen Notes
`LINKS`: [[PKM]] | [source](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)


---
The concept of an evergreen note is taken from [[Andy Matuschack]]'s ideas about notes within a [[PKM]] system. He says that notes should be atomic, concept-oriented, densely [[dense linking|linked, and as]]sociative rather than hierarchical.

## Atomic
Andy thinks that notes should ideally be about one single concept, but should describe that concept in its entirety. He says that this allows notes to link together well and allows the researcher to see previously unknown connections between ideas. See [[atomic notes]]. [[Idea notes should be atomic]]. 

## Concept oriented
Andy argues that notes about a whole book lead to some issues. He says that this format makes it hard to find specific ideas that may have emerged within a text, and difficult to see the specific links between books or topics. In general, [[Organize information for retrieval]]. 

## Associative
Andy wants us to let structure emerge organically, rather than imposing a fixed categorization system on the notes from the outset. He notes that if a new category were to emerge after a while, it would be obscured by the organization system that the notes are crammed into.
