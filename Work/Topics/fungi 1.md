# Fungi üçÑ

# Introduction
Fungi are a kingdom of eukaryotes that includes yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. They primarily play a role as decomposers in every [[ecosystem]] they're found in. 

# Characteristics
Fungi display [[heterotrophy]], and do not partake in [[photosynthesis 1]] like plants. They secrete digestive enzymes into their environment, and absorb nutrients in that way. 

Fungi reproduce through spores. 

Fungi often engage in [[symbiosis]] with plant hosts. 

# Study
The discipline of [[biology]] that is devoted to fungi is called mycology. 

# Varieties
[[psilocybin]] mushrooms are a psychadelic variety. [[mycorrhizae]] are a variant that engages in a symbiotic relationship with plants, living in the root network.
