# Penelope
---
Penelope is an [[internal Indeed tools|internal Indeed tool]] used to automatically create [[GitLab]] repositories and connect them to [[Jenkins]]. 

## Creating projects
The wiki says that you cannot create projects with names sending in 'cronjob,' 'webapp,' or 'index-builder' for some reason. I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional. ^4

Penelope will build a GitLab repo with corresponding skeleton depending on your project specifications during setup.
