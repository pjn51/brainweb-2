# Probability Density Functions

## Introduction
In [[probability]], the probability density function, or PDF, is a [[function]] whose value at any given point provides a relative likelihood tht the value of that random variable would equal the sample. 

## Why do we need PDFs?
Here's a good video on the issues we run into when trying to find the probability of probabilities for continuous variables --> [[3blue1brown - Why “probability of 0” does not mean “impossible” (2020)]]
