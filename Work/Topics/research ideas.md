## Broad ideas
1. It would be so cool to apply [[machine learning]] models or some deep learing neural network type shit (IDK what any of these words mean) to forest sucessional models, or models of disturbance!
2. I've also been thinking while reading Asimov's *Foundation* that the field of "psychohistory" is basically the highest possible use for [[data science]] and prediction. An algorithm that can predict the development of humanity as a whole! Very cool. 
3. Could you make a stock trading algorithm that takes in data besides the historical performance of stocks? That seems like it would be far more powerful. Quantitative measures of economic trends, trade relations, and general things worldwide must be being factored into these algorithms right?
4. I want to make [[Conway's game of life]]. 
5. I want to make a tool that can find unlinked mentions in [[Obsidian]] and link them for me.

## [[classification]]
1. A classification algorithm that predicts whether a county will go Republican or Democrat based on economic and social indicators. [Voting data](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/us-president-precinct-results/query/master?q=SELECT+*+FROM+%60vote_tallies%60+WHERE+election_year+%3D+2020%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&active=Tables). 
2. A classification algorithm that will predict whether or not a comment will be removed by Reddit moderators for a specific subreddit? [Data](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/).
3. A classification algorithm that will predict if two people are likely to want to go on a second date based on this extensive [dataset](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/01/21/the_speeddating_1/). Not enough observations though.
4. A classification algorithm that predicts whether or not someone will die if they get [[COVID-19]]. [Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). Target would be death status (Y / N) and features would be sex, age group, race / ethnicity, hospitalization, icu admission, and presence of underlying comorbidity. 
5. A classification algorithm that can predict country of origin based on plot of a move.

## [[communication and deployment|Model Deployment]]
It would be so cool to have [[Eylen]] make a sleek website that I could run a model out of. Like my [[fake job classifier]] where you could enter a job description and it could tell you if it was fake!

## [[NLP]]
It would be really cool to create a classification model that could figure out the ideology of political theory! This is a bit of an edgier project so I'll probably do it in my own time. I could scrape marxists.org. Related to this, I could create a sort of geneology tracking the language of theorists. I bet there's a line of [[evolution]] from Marx to Engels, to Lenin and Trotsky. I wonder who Stalin and Mao are more or less similar to. 

What if I scraped the text of all Anthony Fantano's reviews and created a recommendation engine where users could put in adjectives and it would return the albums that Anthony describes using those words most often? DONE. 

## [[neural network]]
I want to teach a NN how to play Mario. There's a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) on this concept. 

I think I could teach a NN how to play tic-tac-toe or snake.
