In order to prepare, we need to research in three areas. The first area is to research yourself. Be armed with a summary of your qualifications that are relevant to the role. Ask yourself how you can meet the employer's needs and how you can add value. 

We also need to research the position. We need to have a clear idea of what the role is and how the role generates value. We should research the employer as well, so that we can give a reason of why we want to work there, and what the field is like overall. Finally, research the industry as well. This will help to give context. 

We should prepare a series of short, relevant *stories.* This is the show-and-tell method. We should be able to *show* our skills, not just tell the employer that we have skills. We should practice delivering these, and practice responses to questions that we expect the employer to ask. Our responses shouldn't be scripted, but we should be ready for the questions. 

First impressions matter a lot. You have seven seconds to really imprint on the interviewer. Have good eye contact, a strong handshake, and be positive and confident. Most people need to "turn up the volume" on their personality a little bit. 

There are three kinds of interviews. The most common is the *behavioral interview.* In this form, they ask questions about your response to challenging situations for example. *Technical interviews* are also common for technical roles. We may have to do some whiteboard coding. *Case interviews* are common for consulting positions.

Telephone and online interviews are becoming more common, especially for initial interviews. Make sure that your energy is coming through the phone, since they can't see your body language. For a Zoom interview, wear something colorful, but no patterns. Also make sure you're looking at the camera to simulate eye contact. Watch your background!

After the interview, establish a next step. Also try and have a closing statement to let the interviewer know that you're interested in the next step. Once the interview is over, send some kind of thank you email or something. Thank the interviewer for their time, and reiterate your interest and qualifications.
