# Dense linking
---
Dense linking is a [[PKM]] methodology found within tools that allow for internal links, such as a [[wiki]] or [[Obsidian]].

The idea is that whenever given a chance to naturally mention an entity that has its own note or page, a link ought to exist there.

[[wiki|Wikis]] tend to be densely linked.
