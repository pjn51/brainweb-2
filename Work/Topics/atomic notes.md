# Atomic Notes
---
Some [[PKM]] thinkers such as [[Andy Matuschack]] and those who practice the [[zettelkasten method]] believe that notes should be atomic, meaning that they contain a single thought or concept. This is opposed to the [[wiki]] conception, where a page can cover a range of ideas related to a concept.

[[To learn, elaborate and summarize]]. This method agrees with this concept, and adivses that we summarize the essential ideas that we glean from texts.

## Benefits
I see how having each idea as it's own note would allow more fine-grained networks of ideas, which would allow unexpected connections to be visible. 

## Drawbacks
However, this would be a challenge in regards to [[Note friction should be minimized]]. How can one decide what constitutes a single idea or a collection of ideas? This would add to the time I spend deliberating about note format. 

Also, I think this doesn't make much sense for literature notes. It would be too scattered to have all my notes drawn from a book exist independently of one another. It would make it very hard to re-read books and rewrite my existing notes as my understanding improves. 

## Conclusion
This is an interesting idea, and one that I think I can adapt and work with. I like having topic notes as a resource, but having idea notes is also helpful due to its incredible flexibility.
