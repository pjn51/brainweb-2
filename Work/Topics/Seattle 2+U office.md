# Seattle 2+U office
---
[[Indeed]] has an office in downtown Seattle. Reception hours are 8am - 5pm, but I can get in with a badge 24/7. They provide parking validation as well.

Breakfast is served on floor 37 from 8am - 10:30am. Lunch is served from 11:30am - 1:30pm. There are also food trucks sometimes. ^3-4

If I want to work at the office, I have to reserve a desk. Since I'm remote, I can reserve a spot on floor 33 (there are also plenty of places to work without a reservation). ^5

Visitors are allowed but must register via the Envoy app. ^2
