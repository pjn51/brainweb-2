PKM frameworks are meant to allow us to manage and grow our knowledge. The field consists of PKM tools, such as [[Obsidian]], and PKM frameworks, such as the [[zettelkasten method]], [[PARA]], and the [[IMF framework]]

I think PKM and artificial intelligence have a lot of potential when paired. I recently learned of a project called Dual. The idea is to train a [[transformer]] on your vault notes, and use that to create a personal assistant with your knowledge base! What a sick idea. ^1

I should remember that [[PKM isn't an end in itself]]. Knowledge management is secondary to knowledge application. 

One thing I've learned throughout my development is that [[Ideas are more important to record than facts]], and that I should [[Build scaffolding, not cages]]. This has led me towards more flexible frameworks such as the [[zettelkasten method]].
