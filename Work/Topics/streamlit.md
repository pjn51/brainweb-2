# Streamlit
`LINKS:` [[Python]] | [[communication and deployment]] | [Site](https://www.streamlit.io/)

Streamlit is an option for connecting python and web servers together. For an introduction, see my [[2-3-21 metis]] notes on model deployment. 

It allows us to format the website using markdown, and has intuitive python methods and functionality to add elements to the website. 

We can also host streamlit apps using streamlit. This is because streamlit is both a python library and a company. 

In order to host a python script on streamlit, you just need to have it in a `.py` file, and `import streamlit as st` needs to be in there. There are various methods we can run that are specific to streamlit, and we can look to the documentation for those. 

When your script is ready, go to the [[command line]] and run `streamlit run myfile.py` to open the output of  `myfile.py` in your browser.
