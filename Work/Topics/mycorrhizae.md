# Mycorrhizae üå±ü§ùüçÑ
---
Mycorrhizae refer to the [[fungi 1]] that engage in [[symbiosis]] with plants. This relationship is very important, and something like 90% of all plant life engages in it. 

# Varieties
Mycorrhizae can be either *arbuscular* or *ectomycorrhizal.* Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonize the host plant's root tissues inside the cells themselvies. Ectomycorrhizal fungi colonizes the plant's root tissues between the cells. 

# Effects
The mycorrhizal relationship depends on the species of fungi engaged in it. The association is usually mutualistic, but can be parasitic. 

## Sugar - water / mineral exchange
One dynamic is that plants provide constant access to carbohydrates in return for access to the mycorrhizae's ability to access water and nutrients more effectively than plant root networks. The fungi has this capacity because of the much higher surface area of mycelial networks, and the ability of fungi to mobilize some nutrients that plants cannot. 

## Inter-plant relationships
Mycorrhizal fungi has been found to work as a network *between* plants as well, more equally dividing water, carbon, and other nutrients between nearby plants, stabilizing the health of the ecosystem. 

## Disease resistance
At [[WWU]], I performed research to investigate the effects of AMF in protecting plants from pathogens like [[root rot]]. We found that plants innoculated with mycorrhizae were less likely to die from the pathogen, but we also found that in soil without any pathogen, the plants with AMF were smaller than those without, indicating that there is a cost paid by the plant for the protection of AMF.
