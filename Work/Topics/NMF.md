# Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
---
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (commonly called NMF), is a family of algorithms in [[linear algebra]] where a [[matrices|matrix]] $V$ is factorized into two matrices $W$ and $H$ . All three of these matrices are *non-negative,* meaning they have no negative elements, making the matrices easier to deal with. 

[[How does NMF work?]]

NMF has many applications, including [[NLP]] and [[computer vision]].
