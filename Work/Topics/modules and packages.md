# Introduction
Modules can be imported to give us increased functionality. To be concrete, modules are just .py files that have many functions inside them. When you import them, you gain access to the functions described in the file. 

We can also import a specific function from a module, using the syntax: 

`from <module> import <function>`

We can rename the module as we import it: ` import <package> as <shorthand>`. 
We can use the built-in function `dir( )` to see a list of functions included in a module. 

Packages are groups of modules that can be imported all at once. They are composed of many modules.
