# ESCI 101 notes
`LINKS: `[[environmental science]]

---
We can get extra credit for participating in the WWU LEAD program which only takes 2-3 hours of volunteer work.

We are talking today about the restoration of the Mississippi River Delta. This ties into the reading on the subject. 

# Scale and Hierarchy
A lot of problems are caused by a misunderstanding of environmental hierarchy. 

tissues, organs, etc --> organisms --> species --> population --> community --> ecosystem

We used to define a species by who could reproduce together. Now we use genetic similarities instead which is a more accurate way to do it. 

A species living in one place is called a population, which can be huge or tiny based on the geography of the area.

A variety of populations interacting with one another is a community.

An ecosystem is the interaction of the community and abiotic (non-biological) factors such as the air and water and geology.

A change at one level of the hierarchy can affect every and any level of the hierarchy. For instance, a change at the level of a species can affect the whole ecosystem

EX: Many people live in the watershed of Lake Whatcom. They have a population of grass in their lawn which they use chemical fertilizer on. Those people have a problem at the population level (their grass being dead) and fix it at that population scale. The extra nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in Lake Whatcom. This causes an overabundance of organisms in Lake Whatcom and everything becomes a problem at the ecosystem scale. 

The real solution to the grass problem is to grow native plants instead of forcing non-native shit to grow

EX: Salmon are no longer able to thrive without our assistance. The current system of artificial fish hatcheries costs around $500 per fish! What’s the proper scale for this problem? Maybe we should look at another level. 

We used to classify all the different species by outward similarities but now we know there are other factors to take into account. 

## Hurricane Katrina: A Problem of Scale
This is a tragic example of misunderstanding hierarchy and scale. 

In 2005, Katrina formed as a cat-5, hit New Orleans as a cat-4. 

It took 12 years to empty all the refugee camps that were formed after the storm. Lots of people blamed the levees for the flooding of New Orleans and the Army Corps of Engineers. This was part of the problem but not the entire problem. 

We need to look at this problem at a different scale. 

Mississippi River Delta
- This is the huge watershed that deposits sediments at the coast. This creates lots of good land because they are flat and fertile and are great places to build cities. 
- Strangely, the highest ground is right next to the river because that's where the most sediment is deposited
- The Mississippi River watershed
	- This is a HUGE watershed that spans almost all of the midwest [[USA]]. 
- In order for land to remain in the delta...
   - The rate of sediment deposition needs to be higher than the rate of sea level rise and subsidence
      - Subsidence is caused by loose sediments compacting and sinking into the earth
* Deltaic Cycle
   * A river in a delta cannot possibly stay in the same course forever because it becomes so flat due to sediment deposition
      * The river is really ready to jump its banks right now but we can’t let that happen due to the economic consequences which would be shitty and in the billions of damage to our oil refinery industry
      * We have stopped the river from changing course
   * Sediment is usually deposited along shallow waters but now that the river goes straight into the deep ocean, we have no more deposition happening
      * Now what used to be solid land is going back to open ocean which no longer acts as a block to weaken hurricanes
* Dams in the Mississippi watershed
   * This has greatly reduced sediments flowing into the Mississippi which is another thing that we don't want
* Rates of wetland loss
   * We lose about 2cm/year of wetland elevation which translates to about 50-60 km^2 per year
* Storm pulse attenuation
   * Every mile of wetland...
      * Reduces storm surge by 8 in
      * Reduces wind speed by 25%
* What is the proper solution?
   * Is the solution to make better levees?
   * We have to rebuild the land that has been lost 
      * There have been various diversions created to allow the Mississippi floodwaters to re-enter certain areas of flooded land to deposit sediments and that program has been pretty successful


# Economics and the Environment
What’s the correct answer to the prisoner’s dilemma? It depends on whether you think of just yourself or the common good. For your own self interest, it is best to snitch on your friend. When considering both of you, it is best to never snitch. 

Many environmental problems are related to the prisoner’s dilemma. We have a conflict of self interest versus common good. 

# Tragedy of the Commons (1968)
Imagine a village with a common grazing area in the middle. There are five farmers who choose to graze 2 cows in the commons each. With this scenario, all farmers make equal amounts of [[currency|money]]. One farmer decides to graze 3 cows instead of 2 on the commons next year. There is no longer enough food for all the cows to grow to full potential. The farmer who added the 3rd cow still makes some money, but everyone makes less money per cow because they are smaller. This incentivizes all the farmers to add an additional cow because they are making less money and see their friend making more. This accelerates the depletion of food for all the cows and everything gets fucked up. Freedom in the commons leads to tragedy for all. 

This kind of thing happens in the environment all the time.

>“As human populations increase, there will be increasing pressure on finite resources both at the local, and particularly, global level, with the result of overexploitation and ruin.” - Garret Hardin

## What are the “Commons?”
* Grazing areas
* Fisheries
* Game animal populations
* Timber
* National Parks

This exact problem happened with the cod population in the Atlantic. There was a strong population up until the 60s when they were seriously overfished and nearly depleted totally. Even to this day, cod fisheries are commercially unviable. 

## Reverse Tragedy of the Commons
For an individual, the cost of discharging waste is far less than the cost of purifying or treating it. 
It becomes impossible to compete in industry without polluting if your competitors are doing it to save money.
In essence, this practice privatizes the profits, and socializes the costs.

## Solutions to this problem
Garret Hardin says there is no technical solution because any increase in ability to produce will be overrun eventually by demand. 

It’s easy to find energy sources, the real problem is the dissipation of waste products from those energy sources. 

Every technological solution to a natural problem creates subsequent and nesting issues that create their own, etc...

There are other kinds of solutions besides technological solutions. 
* Regulations (Hardin called this mutual coercion)
   * We do this all the time to manage scarce resources
* Economic incentive (such as a tax or fine)
   * It’s difficult to put an economic value on an environmental harm
* Reduce the population
   * This is extremely unpopular
* Appeal to the conscience
   * Try to educate people to not do bad shit
   * Unfortunately, there will always be cheaters in any system
* Privatize

# Ecological Economics
EX 1: In a lake, there are fish. There are many factors that allow these fish to grow. Nutrient cycling, water flow and regulation, water purification, water quality, photosynthesis, food, all allow fish to grow in a lake. If we don't mess any of this up, the fish will grow all by themselves. When we add humans to the picture, they want to eat some fish. This creates a fishing industry which takes them to the market and humans to be eaten. 

In order to put a price on the fish in the example, we need to look at ALL the factors involved, which we currently don't. 

Externalities: things that we don't currently consider when pricing goods and services, but really matter a lot. 

## Automobile
Upfront Cost
* Cost of materials
* Branding
* Labor costs
Hidden Cost
* Air pollution
* Respiratory illness
* Surface water runoff pollution
* Resource extraction costs
   * Oil spills
* National security in the Middle East


What are all the ecosystem goods and services?
There are three categories
* Provisioning Services: there has been some success in regulation here
   * Fresh water
   * Genetic resources
   * Food
   * Fiber
   * Fuel
   * Biochemicals
* Regulating Services: the things that sustain our ecosystem
   * Climate regulation
   * Disease regulation
   * Water regulation
   * Water purification
   * Pollination
* Cultural Services: nonmaterial things that we all value
   * Spiritual and [[religion|religious]]
   * Recreation and ecotourism
   * Aesthetic resources
   * Inspirational
   * Educational
   * Sense of place
   * Cultural heritage
* Supporting Services: the building blocks of our environment
   * Soil formation
   * Nutrient cycling
   * Primary production of energy
Costanza came up with the number $33 trillion per year for what all that is worth. The world [[GDP]] is only $18 trillion per year. 

Puget Sound Valuation
* Up to $61.7 billion per year
* $243 billion - $2.1 trillion worth of total assets
* Shorelines, eelgrass beds, and freshwater marshes were the most valuable per acre

How to value environmental assets?
* There are entire courses and major programs on this issue
* Paradoxes of this issue
   * Most of these products have no commercial value for the people who “own” them
   * Commercial values are finite while natural assets provide value in perpetuity
   * Estimates are biased because a lot of them are subjective
   * Relationships between area and value are complex
   * Value depends on context in the area and landscape
   * Ecosystems are multiple-value systems which have many factors that provide value

Methods for Valuing Ecosystem Goods and Services
* Replacement Cost Method
   * How much would it cost to replace that natural function?
   * EX: wetlands which purify water should be valued at the amount it costs to artificially do the same function in a treatment plant
* Avoided Cost Method
   * If we can avoid a large cost, we should
   * There are situations where by paying a small amount, we can ensure that we won’t have to pay a huge price
* Other valuation methodology
   * Travel cost methodology
      * A place is as valuable as the money you spent to get there and use the space
      * Usually done to value recreational space like parks
   * Hedonic pricing
      * Putting a value on a view, sometimes through [[real estate]] prices
* Embodied Energy approach
   * Just look at all the energy that it took to create something in order to value it and use the $ equivalent to determine the total value
   * There are lots of different kinds of energy, including knowledge (the energy flowing between synapses)
   * For instance, the gov’t compensated the families of highly educated people more than the families of less educated victims of the attack
   * Value is a function of the total energy used to build and maintain that process or product
   * A relationship exists between embodied energy and money

# Solutions to the Tragedy of the Commons
Let's talk about population control

20,000 years ago, we came out of the worst of the last ice age
We are in a period of remarkably stable climate (for now)

The reason this chart is so drastic is nothing except for exponential growth and is how all populations grow. 

Since I was born, over 1,000,000,000 others have been born

## Rate of Growth
The per capita growth rate is 
R = B - D or births minus deaths. The current rate is about 1.1% increase per year throughout human history. 
        The rate really doesn’t matter because it will eventually explode no matter what

### Environmental Impact of Population Growth
Resource growth increases exponentially. 

USA
Population x RESOURCE USE

Developing Countries
POPULATION x resource use (and resource use is increasing fast)

Cars per capita
There is around 1 car per person in the [[USA]].
In 1976, there was 1 car for every 70,000 people in [[China]].
Now there is 1 car per 22 people in China.

www.gapminder.org 

Living in Chinese smog is the equivalent of smoking 2-3 packs of cigarettes a day

## Ecological Footprint
This is a function of population, resource use, and waste assimilation

Nation|Footprint|Actual Available Land|Deficit/Surplus
---|---|---|---
U.S.|10.3 ha|6.7 ha|-3.6
China|1.2 ha|0.8 ha|-0.4
Netherlands|5.3 ha|1.7 ha|-3.6
	
We can be in a deficit of available land because we import goods and export waste

The world has a deficit of around -0.7 ha
This can exist because we are drying up the natural resources of the world and living on the [[capital]], not just the interest of the natural world. 

Qatar leases 40,000 hectares from Kenya to grow food. 

## Limits to Population Growth
  
Population size is regulated by density-dependent factors
* Food supply
* Habitat
* Predators
* Disease / parasites
* War 
* Energy supply

Should we just wait around for our population to become stable? Well millions would die of starvation in a horrible death so maybe not. 

Carrying Capacity = The number of individuals of a species that can be indefinitely sustained in a given area

There is a big difference between maximizing the carrying capacity and optimizing it.
It’s way better to optimize it because a maximum of people on earth would be a very shitty existence.

## How many humans?
Have we exceeded the Earth’s carrying capacity?
An estimated 1,000,000 people don't have enough food to lead an active, healthy life.
Water scarcity affects 1-2 billion people and 1.2 billion people lack clean water.

Meat and the Environment
* Current harvest capacity of various diets
   * Vegetarian: 7 billion
   * 15% meat: 4 billion
   * American / European diet: 3 billion
* 100 kg of grain are needed for every 10 kg of meat

Social Factors that Influence Population
* The demographic transition can stabilize populations before they hit the carrying capacity
   * Problems of the demographic transition
      * There may not be enough resources to allow all countries to move through the full transition to a stable population
      * The population is now growing faster than before
      * Resource use is growing faster as well

# Water Resources
Water may ultimately be the limiting factor in our population growth. More world conflicts are fought over water than even oil. 

## The American Water Situation
We are lucky to not really have to share water with anyone. [[Canada]] has more water than they could ever need while [[Mexico]] isn’t powerful enough to claim any of our water.

200 of the 214 major world rivers are shared between countries.


## Middle Eastern Water
* Dry climate
* Three river basins between many countries
* Already limited water supply
* Population increase expected by 2x in the next 25 years


## Stress on World Water Supply
  

This map depicts stress on the world’s major river basins based on the amount of water available versus the water needs of the region


### The Colorado River
It used to flow all the way to [[Mexico]] based on snowmelt.
It now has 6 dams on it which dramatically lower the water levels getting to Mexico
  
Environmental Disturbances
* Chronic water shortages affects 40% of the world population
* Uneven water distribution
   * Canada: 0.5% of the world’s population, 20% of freshwater supply
   * China: 21% of world population, 7% of freshwater
   * California has distribution issues just within the state boundaries

Groundwater and Surface Water
  
* We are now removing water from aquifers faster than it replenishes
   * As we remove water, we can cause sinkholes and collapses while the ground condenses as the water is removed
   * An aquifer’s flow rate can be less than a foot per day, making pollution very dangerous as the pollutant is not washed out like it would be in a river
* The biggest aquifer is the Ogallala Aquifer in the midwest, It stretches from South Dakota to Texas and is deepest in Nebraska
   * Essentially non-renewable water from the last ice age
   * Enough water to cover the whole US
   * We are removing 6 ft per year while it is renewed at 1/2 in per year
  
## More about WATER
Water is very heavy and therefore uneconomical to move far distances using our technology

### Planetary Water Budget
97.5% saltwater
        This is mostly the ocean, obviously
0.014% readily accessible water
        This bit is mostly in lakes and in the soil

We are currently using 54% of readily accessible water on our planet
* Agriculture
* Industry
* Municipalities
* Reservoir Loss
* Instream flow
   * The water required to assimilate the waste we put back into rivers


Bellingham Water
* Our water comes from Lake Whatcom and needs very little treatment because of the nearly-pristine watershed
* The county recently reconveyed land from [[state]] to the county around Lake Whatcom in order to protect it from logging
* Threats to Lake Whatcom
   * Benzene
   * Phosphorus
      * This fertilizer washes into the lake, causing algae blooms that eat up all the available oxygen in the water, killing all other species in the lake and causing eutrophication. As the algae dies, bacteria in the water eat the algae and eat up even more oxygen.
   * Sediments
   * Development
      * As we remove the intact landscape, purification services work less well. This includes logging and housing. There are now moratoriums on building in the watershed
   * Mercury
      * There are now advisories to not eat the fish in Lake Whatcom because of the mercury content, especially if you are a woman of childbearing years or a little kid. 
      * The mercury exists in the organisms of the lake, not the water.
      * Harmful mercury is created in low-oxygen environments
      * Sources
         * Local, like the Georgia Pacific or the recomp solid waste incinerator or the Post Point waste treatment plant
         * Global atmospheric transport from global burning of coal and other bad shit
         * Scientists have tried to take core samples of the lakebed and look for mercury content and date the sediment which contains the most mercury, using latent radiation from nuclear testing
         * It turned out that most mercury comes from the global atmospheric transport of mercury
      * Effects of increased mercury concentration
         * Moves readily across the placenta into fetal tissue, and it is a teratogen
         * Damage to the central nervous system
            * Development
            * Loss of hearing, sight, and other senses
            * Paralysis
            * Dementia and intellectual deterioration
         * Kidney damage (renal damage)
   * Fecal coliform
      * Shit in the water, human or otherwise
   * Eutrophication
      * Overfertilization (see phosphorous)
   * Boating
      * There was a boating ban in 2005 but it was replaced with a restriction on 2-stroke engines which are more powerful but cause more pollution
   * Storm water
   * Sewage overflow
* Because of these threats, we have to pay for some treatment but the lake is still a pretty good source of water and doesn’t need a ton of treatment


Bellingham Bay
* There used to be a Georgia Pacific plant producing toilet paper, right on the bay
   * This plant used lots of mercury to make chlorine as a bleaching agent
   * Lots of this mercury ended up in Bellingham Bay and got into the fish


Water Pollution
   * Sources
   * Type of water body affected
      * Lake, stream, ocean, or groundwater
      * Groundwater is nearly impossible to clean, while the ocean can absorb an insane amount of pollution
   * Forms (chemical and physical structure)
      * Some forms of pollution affect only water organisms while others pollute the water itself
   * Typical concentrations
      * Some pollutants are only harmful at certain concentrations
   * Mechanisms of action (how does it affect what it affects?)
      * Environmental
         * Some things just fuck the environment without harm to humans
      * Human health
* Types of water pollution
   * Infectious agents
      * Disease causing organisms like bacteria and viruses or worms
      * Sources are typically human or animal waste
      * Fecal coliform is a good indicator of this category
      * These have many harmful effects as the organisms include hepatitis, giardia, typhoid, and other really bad shit
   * Oxygen demanding waste
   * Organic chemicals
      * A chemical being “organic” just means it’s carbon based
      * These are things like oil, gas, pesticides, cleaning solvents, and agriculture and urban runoff
      * Sources include liquid industrial waste and agricultural and urban runoff
   * Sediments (dirt and clay and stuff that washes into water bodies)
   * Thermal pollution
      * Any industry that uses river water to cool machinery changes the temperature of the river, sometimes to the detriment of the river as a whole
   * Biotic invasions
      * Organisms can hitch a ride on ships in the ballast water in order to get into waterways and areas that they have no natural predators in
   * Hydrologic alterations
      * Dams
   * Inorganic chems
      * Acids, metals, salts, nitrogen, phosphorous, fertilizer
      * Nitrogen and phosphorous are especially bad for waterbodies because of 
      * Sources include industrial runoff and urban runoff


The Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen is limited in the world and is very necessary for human survival. Nitrogen comes from the atmosphere originally. We can only consume organic N2.   


Industrial N fixation (the Haber Process)
  

Consequences of the Haber Process
* Increased crop yields
* Reduction of biodiversity
   * It’s better to have a very diverse ecosystem because if something goes wrong then there are organisms to adapt to the new conditions instead of all of them going extinct immediately
   * Some plants do badly in high-nitrogen environments
* Eutrophication
   * Excessive nutrients discharged into an aquatic system
   * The Decomposer Food Chain (above) is how a lake can get fucked up  
   * The Mississippi River Basin has some problems with excess nitrogen
   * The Dead Zone: there is an area near the outlet of the Mississippi where there is no life in the ocean because that’s where all the nitrogen ends up
   * The city of Bellingham just spent $15M on an upgrade to the water treatment plant because of eutrophication in Lake Whatcom


Solutions to Water Pollution
There are point and non-point sources of pollution. Point sources are things like sewage plants, factories, mines, and oil tankers. Basically the sources of pollution that we can see the exact place that the pollution occurs. Non-Point sources are things like agricultural sources, atmospheric deposition, golf courses, logged forests, parking lots, and urban runoff. These are types of pollution that are harder to detect and are more diffuse.  

The Clean Water Act of 1972 is the set of rules that allowed us to address non-point sources of pollution way better. Nixon passed it, which is interesting because he was a Republican. The goal of this act was to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of our water, that is, to make all waters drinkable, fishable, and swimmable.

This act was necessary because of the insane levels of pollution at the time before the act was passed. There were rivers catching on fire all over the damn place because of all the chemical shit in there. Lake Erie was almost totally a dead zone. There was crazy smog levels all over the US. Entire towns were abandoned because the pollution was too bad to live in the area.


The Clean Water Act Requires...
   * States must identify waters not meeting state water quality standards
   * This list of shitty water has never been completed and probably never will be because it’s always changing


        In 1998, the EPA finally published their unfinished 303d list (list of polluted waters) in the United States. The top 5 pollutants in water were sediments, pathogens, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous), metals, and dissolved oxygen. In the state of WA, the number one is fecal coliform, while number two is thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is way higher in Washington than the national average because of salmon. Salmon requires shady, cool water to live, and when river areas are deforested the river becomes warmer because there's no shade. This makes river temperature very important. Most water bodies in the United States are on the EPA’s list
        To find an identifiable source of pollution, we have the NPDES Permit System. This is the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System. This is pretty much giving permits for pollution. This works great for point source pollution. Now, factories and other polluters have to get a permit in order discharge x amount of pollution and are required to put sensors and shit all over the place. They have to report their pollution levels to the EPA every year. Permits can be issued by either the EPA or state governments. 
        In order to treat wastewater on the local level, we need to decide, how do we want to murder salmon? We can either murder salmon by pumping sewage right into their habitat and killing them, or build a wastewater treatment center and build a dam to power it, preventing salmon from swimming up river and killing them this way. 
        All the sewage flows down to our plant, and the big stuff is quickly screened away and incinerated. Then, they let the water settle down in big tanks, and burn the shit again. They put the water in a big tank of bacteria which eat the waste and they burn the waste, again and again... Then, they chlorinate and dechlorinate the water and pump it into the bay. We don’t have to do anything else because the Bellingham Bay is big enough to absorb the remaining pollution from our town. Unfortunately, this process is pretty much taking pollution out of the water and putting it into the atmosphere. Our waste treatment plant of course requires a NPDES permit to pollute the bay.
        The Total Maximum Daily Load (or TMDL) is a strategy for regulating non-point pollution. 
For example, say we’re regulating phosphorus in Lake Whatcom. We need to know...
   * The current level of phosphorus in the lake
   * What levels are acceptable
   * Current loading rates
   * Where the phosphorus is coming from (point/non-point)
   * How much phosphorus can the lake accept
   * Plan for remediation (how do we fix this mess)
   * Future development? (this plan might have to be re-done in the future)


        These solutions, while they are really expensive, DO WORK but they take a long time. 


        There are up to one billion people without enough food in the world. About 18 to 20 million people die of starvation every year. In the [[USA]], there are 20 million chronically hungry people. 
        World grain production has increased from 692 million tons in 1950 to 1.9 billion tons in 1992. We have essentially tripled our grain production while only increasing our farmland by a tiny bit (a 170% increase in production per acre). We have done this through the industrialization of agriculture. We now have larger farms, fueled machinery, intense use of fertilizer and pesticides, and higher-yield plant varieties.
        Since 1970, there have been six Americans who have won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
   * Al Gore
   * Jimmy Carter
   * Elie Wiesel: “The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.”
   * Henry Kissinger
   * Norman Borlaug
   * Barack Obama (!?)
        The one name that isn't widely known is Norman Borlaug. He won the Prize for his work on food supply. He saved millions of lives by helping developing countries figure out how to grow food and transport it long distances. 
        Norman helped start the Green Revolution. This is not “green” as in sustainable, because a lot of this stuff isn't sustainable. This is about the revolution in growing a shit ton of food. These solutions included...
   * High yield crops
   * Intensive fertilizer
   * Irrigation
   * Selective use of pesticides
        Norman started his work in Mexico. The government needed to produce more food for the population, and Norman created the Dwarf Spring Wheat. This was a variety of wheat that was much smaller and grew much, much faster. This wheat was shipped all over the world, to places with food supply problems like India and Pakistan in 1965. By 1968 (only three years!), Pakistan changed from starving to self-sufficient and India actually began to export food by the 1980s. 
        There were some problems with the Green Revolution. It increased the amount of fertilizer and pesticide, and it uses lots of fossil fuels to create food now. Many cultures now have lost their traditional cultural food to the new wheat crops. 


Pesticides
The ideal pesticide would be one that harms nothing except the target organism, is cheap to use, breaks down fast after being applied, and doesn’t cause genetic resistance in the target organism.
Plants first invented pesticides 225 mya. These were chemicals secreted by the plants themselves which were either harmful to the insects or made the plants taste bad. People started using things like sulfur, lead, arsenic, and mercury by 500 BC until the 1920s. These were really bad at doing the goals in the above paragraph. Beginning in the 1600s, some people saw that we could replicate the original plant pesticides, like nicotine sulfate, pyrethrum, or rotenone. Synthetic pesticides were invented in the 1940s, like DDT. We are now moving into a new wave of pesticides based on genetic engineering, and we may see many better pesticides come into existence.


Pesticide Advantages
They save human lives from diseases like malaria and typhus. This is because they eliminate or reduce the insect population.
It helps increase food production at a lower costs. The health risks are insignificant when compared to the danger of starvation, when the pesticides are used properly. 
Newer pesticides are safer and more effective, and can be used at lower and safer concentrations. For example, the Washington Apple crop is now 90% less toxic than they used to be because of the advances of pesticides. 


Pesticide Disadvantages
 They can cause genetic resistance in insects, making insects stronger and stronger. This process can happen very fast, sometimes in only a few insect generations. By killing off the weaker insects, the stronger ones breed and create stronger and stronger insects. This is the same reason that you have to take all your antibiotics or run the risk of creating super bacteria inside yourself. In order to account for this, we have to add more and more pesticides in higher concentrations. There has been a 33x increase in the amount of pesticides we use, but we still lose the same amount of crops to pests (31%)
Pesticides don’t stay put. Only 2-5% reach the intended pest, while the rest goes out into the air, water, and ground, as well as non-target organisms. This is obviously really bad.
There are lots of environmental and health effects. A lot of these health effects are suffered by workers on the farms, including those in other countries. They cause chemical hazards, like carcinogens, mutagens (which affect [[DNA]] and are inheritable), teratogens, and hazardous chemicals, like an explosive or something obvious like that. Pesticides cause harm to wildlife (20% of the bee population has been eliminated, probably because of insecticides). 67 million birds die every year due to pesticides, and 6-14 million fish go the same way. 
This harm to animals is because of a process called bioaccumulation. This is when the uptake of a substance in an organism exceeds the rate of excretion. This is usually because the chemical is being stored in fats or muscle in the organism. Not all chemicals are like this, such as alcohol. 
There is another process, biomagnification. This is the process by which the concentration of a pollutant spreads up the food chain. If worms eats some mercury and a fish eats a ton of worms, then the fish has that mercury. If humans eat lots of fish, mercury levels can become dangerous. This process may be why the Orca whales in the Puget Sound are doing so badly. They are the top of the food chain and live long lives, eating lots of stuff.


Sidebar: Mercury in Canned Tuna
Some people were interested in Tuna because they’re a classic bioaccumulator of mercury, having lots of fat for storage and big appetites. They analyzed several types of tuna, from cheap to expensive. Their hypothesis was that the more expensive tuna would have more mercury. The cheaper tuna is made up of bits of tiny, young tuna while the more expensive tuna is made up of a single, larger and older fish which has had more time to gain mercury since birth.   
They were correct! The expensive albacore had a lot more mercury than the cheap CS-light and BB-light


Alternatives to Pesticides
        You can use cultivation techniques to get rid of pests. You can switch the plant areas to fool bugs, adjust planting times so the bugs don’t know when to strike, use natural enemies like ladybugs and shit, 
        Biopesticides are a great alternative, and are naturally occurring chemicals that kill or deter bugs. This might not work great because genetic resistance is still a problem.
        Genetic engineering may be the future of pesticides. Crops can be modified to resist diseases and critters. Some are resistant to herbicide in order to allow farmers to kill weeds among the plants without risking the crops. This wave of science is already in our world.

Greenhouse Gasses
        CH4, CO2, and N2O are the main greenhouse gasses. They are necessary for life but now we have too much of them. Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, but isn't really important because it reacts to the gases and ends up being a dependent variable.
        All the greenhouse gasses aren't equal. They have different “lifespans” of being in the atmosphere. They also have different capacities to trap heat. For instance, methane is 20x more powerful than CO2. They also have different concentrations in the atmosphere. This is why CO2 is the most important, because there’s a shit ton of it in the atmosphere. There are 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, and 315 parts per billion of N2O.


Radiative Forcing
        The rate of radiative forcing is the weighed potential of a greenhouse gas, considering all the factors. CO2 has the highest radiative forcing. 


  

Above: This graph shows the global concentration of CO2 over the last 400,000 years, clearly showing that we have dumped an abnormal amount into the system, starting in the industrial revolution. We have this data by looking at ice cores from the past and seeing the CO2 concentration inside the small bubbles.


Where is the carbon coming from anyway?
  

Above: The numbers represent the number of gigatons of carbon. As we can see, the majority of the carbon on Earth is in the ocean. The arrows represent gigatons per year of carbon movement. There is more carbon going into the ocean from the atmosphere than vice versa. This causes the ocean to become more acidic, which is already hurting some species in there. There is a small net movement of carbon from the atmosphere to plants and soil that naturally happens. But, based on what humans have done to the vegetation and soil of earth, there is now a net movement of 1 gigaton per year into the atmosphere! Fossil fuels are pretty much carbon that's been in reserve for 250 million years. It's been so long that life has evolved without that extra carbon being in the environment. It's now entering the world system at 9 gigatons/year. Humans add those 9 to the system per year while all the volcanoes on Earth combined add 0.1.


  

Above: Coal power is the most prominent source of greenhouse gases.


Worldwide CO2 Emissions
        China is #1 for total emissions, we are #2. As countries become more developed, they tend to create more GGs. 


The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
        This is a huge group of environmental and social scientists that are trying to study and stop [[climate change]]. It's sponsored by the United Nations and they release assessment reports about the state of the climate. Many thousands of scientists contribute to the 10,000+ page assessment, which is released every 5-6 years. They also report a summary which is only 50 pages, for the general public.
        Some scientists think that the IPCC is too conservative in their estimate of the danger of climate change.


Summary of the 2013 IPCC Report of the Past Century
   * Global surface temp has increased .85C
   * Snow cover and ice has decreased
   * Sea level has risen 0.21 meters
   * Greenhouse gases have increased 40% since 1750
   * This is the highest concentration for the last 800,000 years
   * 75% of this increase is from fossil fuels
   * 25% is from changes in land use
   * Natural factors have only contributed minor changes
   * Most of the warming over the last 50 years is because of human activities


How do we know that warming is our fault?
  
  

Above: All our models that do not include human activity cannot account for the increase in temperature, while the model including natural and human influences fits the observed data really well.


IPCC: The Next 100 Years
   * Projections of up to 970 ppm of CO2, it is currently 400 ppm
   * Stabilization at 450 ppm would require we lower emissions to pre-1990s levels, within the next 2 decades
   * Temperature will increase up to 3.7C
   * Sea level increase up to 0.63 M


What we know for certain about climate change
        We know that greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. That’s just physics and we’ve known this for over 100 years. We also know that CO2 emissions have increased 40% from 1990 to 2008. Therefore, we know that human activities are changing the atmospheric quantity and composition of greenhouse gases. 
        We’ve also seen that global temperatures have increased by 0.19C per decade over the past 25 years, and Greenland’s and Antartica’s ice sheets are losing mass at an increasing rate. The melting of glaciers has also accelerated. The rate of sea level rise has accelerated to about 0.34 cm per year over the past 15 years.


One Consequence of Climate Change: Sea Level Rise
        Globally, 634 million people live within 30 feet of sea level. 
        There are a lot of different ways to measure the sea level, but all ways show a steady increase since the last ice age. The rate is now accelerating. There is a range of possibilities for the future sea level, but they are all a lot higher than they would have been without our influence. For tide gauges, the reality of the situation has been the worst case scenario of the IPCC model, showing a general underprediction. 
        The main factor of increased sea level is the thermal expansion of the ocean (about 60%). The water is expanding because of global temperature increase. The rest is glacial ice and other melting ice sources. 


Wetland Sustainability in the Po Delta and Venice Lagoon
        This situation really isn't that different than New Orleans. In Venice, they have fixed the Po river into place, causing the same negative effects as the fixation of the Mississippi. The ancient Venetians wanted their lagoon to stay at the current depth, and saw that the rivers were adding land, so they blocked them off or diverted them. 
        The situation is made even worse because of regional weather patterns. The wind currents of the Mediterranean push water up the Adriatic Sea towards Venice. 
  

Above: this is a graph of the number of floods per year above 80 cm. In 1900 it flooded 6 times per year, and in 1990 it flooded 99 times.


        Venice has tried to deal with this issue by sealing the lagoon off from the sea with lots and lots of big gates. It is impossible to seal the lagoon entirely because most sewage systems in Venice drain directly into the lagoon. There are now a series of floodgates that are raised during the floods and lowered for the rest of the time. These floodgates also damage local wetlands that rely on open seawater to bring in nutrients. 


The Danger of Positive Feedbacks
        Most biological systems rely on negative feedback (feedback that tampers down the system) and don't work well with positive feedbacks. When a population grows too high, they starve or are eaten but the population then decreases because of that negative feedback. There are only a few positive feedbacks, such as when a woman gives birth, she starts having contractions and that signals the body to have even more contractions until the baby is born. That is a positive feedback because it is a signal to start doing things more than you were. 
        Our global ecosystem also has positive and negative feedbacks. A dangerous positive feedback has to do with the permafrost. In the permafrost, there is 1 trillion tons of carbon stored up in there. As the global temperature increases, it melts permafrost, releasing carbon. We've already released 350 billion tons of it. Obviously, as more carbon is released, the temperature is increased at a higher rate, leading to a feedback loop of shit. 
        Another positive feedback has to do with rainforests. As they dry out because of higher temperatures, they become more at risk for fires, which causes more warming, and so on.
        Arctic sea ice also has a positive feedback. As it melts because of rising temperatures, it loses its usual real estate where it functions like a mirror. This increases the rate of warming even more.


Uncertainty about Climate Change
        The human response to these changes is unknown. We might let it get so bad that we all die, or we might actually do something. We also don't know the effects of feedbacks and where the tipping points actually are. Of course, we can't predict the individual events caused by climate change, we can only point to trends. The effects upon our local health, agriculture, water, forests, wildlife, and coastal areas are also unknown.


Effects of Climate Oscillations
        We have to separate the signal from the noise. There is year to year variation of temperature caused by the El Nino / La Nina. The El Nino event is a change in Pacific ocean temperature which happens on an irregular 2-7 year oscillation. It's characterized by higher than average surface temperature in the Pacific. This makes the Americas a little warmer and dryer. La Nina is the opposite change in ocean surface temperature and makes the Americas colder and wetter. La Ninas are great for snowfall and skiing. Mt Baker set the world record for seasonal snowfall during a La Nina year. 
        There is another oscillation called the PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation). It occurs over an irregular, 20-30 year oscillation. We have only observed 2 complete cycles. There is a warm phase and a cool phase, just like the Nina and Nino phases. It is less powerful (on average) than the Nino / Nina event. This is a pretty hard one to spot because it takes so long for it to change. A 0.3F increase in temperature due to this cycle causes forest fires to increase by 65% and streamflow to decrease by 10%.
        These oscillations are often confused with climate change, thus confusing the noise with the signal. 


PNW Climate of the Past Century
        Annual average temp has increased around here 1-3F, and precipitation increased by 11% on average (a little bit wetter but not much). There are global models of climate called General Circulation Models. They aren't great at predicting local changes because of low resolution, so we have to downscale that kind of model to the regional level. The general changes around here are predicted to be wetter, warmer winters and drier summers, with a temp increase of 3-9F. 


Key PNW Issues
        Probably the most pressing issue is freshwater. Snowpack on April 1st is predicted to decrease by 59% by 2080. This means less snow and more rain, which makes water supplies less stable because water isn't stored in the mountains to slowly melt and run down into the river. The Columbia River is predicted to have more flow earlier than it does now, and less water flow during the summer than current levels (because of much lower snowmelt). This means that there’s going to be more water when we don't need it and less when we do. This also causes winter flooding because more rain goes into the rivers instead of becoming snow, raising current flood levels. The 100 year flood is soon going to be the 20 year flood. 
        Freshwater issues also affects salmon. Salmon are born in freshwater and then go down to the ocean. They have to come back up to the freshwater streams to lay eggs and start the cycle over again. Lower streamflows in the summer and higher streamflows in the winter cause hardship for the salmon going up the river. This means a lot less salmon being born. After the salmon are born, they need cool streamwater to live in while they grow up. With warmer waters, this is also going to negatively affect the salmon population. 
        Forests also have their issues. Warmer temperatures and no increase in rainfall is going to cause an increase in evapotranspiration (evaporation right out of a plant). Soil moisture is going to drop during the growing season. Photosynthesis is going to decrease because of water stress. Insects that usually couldn't live up here are going to be able to, such as the pine beetle. 
        Ocean acidification is a major issue around the PNW. Acidification causes shellfish and clam populations to decrease. Ocean acidification is caused by excess CO2 in the atmosphere. We’re pretty much carbonating the ocean very slowly. 


What Can We Do?
        We can make lots of individual decisions that will be a little helpful, but the most important thing is to think about where data comes from. The head of the EPA doesn't think that climate change is even real, much less caused by humans. 
        We need to be mindful of environmental goods and services. You can't have a strong economy without a healthy ecosystem!
