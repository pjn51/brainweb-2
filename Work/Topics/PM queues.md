# PM queues
---
A product measurement queue is a [[Labeler]] task that the [[Measurement]] team uses as a part of a [[product measurement mechanisms|PM mechanism]]. 

## Job quality queues
1. [[SERP Compariment queue]]
2. [[Job to Query queue]]
3. Location Match
4. [[SERP Relevance queue]]

## Job seeker feedback queues
1. [[Midapply Feedback queue]]
2. [[Job Seeker NPS queue]]
3. Relrating
	1. [[SERP Relrating queue]]
	2. [[I2A Relrating queue]]
4. [[Report A Job queue]] comment categorization

We can also think about the relationships between feedback queues:

### Job level
- [[Report A Job queue|RAJ queue]]
- [[Midapply Feedback queue]]
- [[I2A Relrating queue]]

### SERP level
- [[SERP Relrating queue]]

### User level
- [[Job Seeker NPS queue]]

It makes sense that the majority of queues exist at the job level, because that's the one we can make changes in most easily. It's difficult to make user-level feedback actionable since we don't know what experience they had that influenced their opinion and their [[NPS score]] comment.
