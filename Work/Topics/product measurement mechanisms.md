# Product measurement mechanisms
---
The [[Measurement & Tools]] team is interested in measuring the performance of various jobseeker-facing tools and products at [[Indeed]]. That means we must have mechanisms of some kind that allow us to measure the performance concretely. 

Usually these mechanisms are associated with [[PM queues]] that allow for labeling of samples of feedback documents.

>I'm not sure if I should have separate notes for PM queues and PM mechanisms. It seems like the topic of mechanism is broader than queues, but they overlap significantly.
