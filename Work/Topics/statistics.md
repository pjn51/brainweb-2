The central question of statistics is: [[How can we estimate population characteristics?]] The fundamental issue in statistics is that we are almost always dealing with a sample, but we want to make conclusions about a whole population. How can we make sure that we are taking a representative sample, and what tools can tell us useful things about the population by looking at the sample (see [[sample and population]])? 

## Data science applications
The field of [[data science]] is slightly different from pure statistics. We often use larger samples than we would in stats, so that our sample more closely represents the population. 

Statistics help [[data]] scientists determine how much of a result is attributable to noise versus signal, or analyze how effective a collection method was for a data source, or visualizing data by performing summary statistics. This is where [[Data science and statistics overlap]]. 

## Summary statistics
Using numpyâ€™s `stats` library, we can call `stats.describe([mylist])` to get a whole list of [[summary stats]] on a list or another dataset. 

## Descriptive statistics
[[Descriptive stats describe and visualize data]]. 

## Inferential statistics
[[Inferential stats make predictions]]
