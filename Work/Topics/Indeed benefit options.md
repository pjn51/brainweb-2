# Indeed benefit options
---
These are the options for [[my Indeed benefits]]. 

# Medical
See the [comparison chart for medical](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEgGP4Eod0rXCRBv1MvWtn8gRQy9hQnYzkqqNFWr7HY/edit#gid=303510840). It seems like I should go with the low deductible Aetna plan. 

# Dental 
See the [dental comparison chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEgGP4Eod0rXCRBv1MvWtn8gRQy9hQnYzkqqNFWr7HY/edit#gid=2072211623). I could probably make do with the standard Aetna Dental Plan. 

# Vision
See the [vision comparison chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEgGP4Eod0rXCRBv1MvWtn8gRQy9hQnYzkqqNFWr7HY/edit#gid=35682737). It's really cheap, so I think I might go for the VSP Vision Enhanced Plan. 

# Pet insurance
This is directly through MetLife, follow [this link](https://mybenefits.metlife.com/).
