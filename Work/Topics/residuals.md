# Introduction
In [[regression]] analysis, the difference between the predicted value of y and the observed value of y is known as the *residual.* This represents how far off from reality our prediction was. 

Multiple assumptions of [[linear regression]] have to do with the residuals. [[Linear regression assumes independence]], [[Linear regression assumes homoscedasticity]], and [[Linear regression assumes normality]] of residuals.
