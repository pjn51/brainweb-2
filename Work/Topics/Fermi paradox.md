---
The Fermi Paradox is the contradiction between the lack of visible [[extraterrestrial life]] out in [[space]] and the claims that alien intelligence has a high [[probability]] of existing. It's named after an [[Italy|Italian]] physicist, Enrico Fermi. This paradox supports the idea that [[Alien life likely exists]].
