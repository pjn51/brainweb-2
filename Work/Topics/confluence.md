# Confluence

Confluence is an [[internal Indeed tools|internal Indeed tool]] that we use for knowledge management. It's the internal Wiki for [[Indeed]].

However, it's honestly really disorganized and doesn't flow in the way that a good wiki should. For instance, [[Wikis function hierarchically]], but there doesn't seem to be such a structure as far as I can tell.
