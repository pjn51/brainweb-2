A wiki is a [[pkm|knowledge mangagement]] tool that is collaborative and open ended, managed by an entire community via a web browser.

The most popular and famous wiki is [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), but there are also wikis with large communities for video games and other communities.

Wikis tend to embrace [[dense linking]] to connect concepts, and contain only one type of page: concept pages that contain all information pertaining to a specific concept. However, unlike the [[zettelkasten method]], wikis are not [[atomic notes|atomic]].
