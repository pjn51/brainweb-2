## Introduction
A big use for [[derivatives]] is to find the local maximums and minimums of [[functions (python)]]. This will come into play when we try and optimize algorithms. 

Wherever the derivative of a function equals zero, the local slope must be zero, meaning that this is either a minimum or maximum point. For instance, in the $x^2$ parabola, the only place the slope is zero is at the origin, which is the minimum of the function. By setting the derivative to zero, we can find these points. 

Donâ€™t get caught thinking there is only one local min / max when there might be more! For the function $x^3-1$, the derivative is $3x^2$. If we set this to zero, we get x = 1/3, but be careful. This function has changes in direction at both the positive and negative 1/3 points. 

## Concavity / convexity
When we take a second derivative, we can learn even more. A positive 2nd deriv will be convex (U shaped). A negative 2nd deriv will be concave (n shaped).

Therefore, we can see if a local change of direction is a max or a min based on the second derivative. 

$$f(x) = 60x-x^2$$

$$f'(x) = 60-2x$$

$$ f''(x) = -2 $$

Since the second derivative is negative, we know that we can find a local maximum where f'(x) = 0.
