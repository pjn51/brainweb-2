# Ecosystem


---
An ecosystem is a term in [[environmental science]] used to refer to the biotic and abiotic elements in a given area. This includes the plant and animal community as well as the abiotic factors such as the climate and geology. 

An ecosystem has a certain [[biome]] type, which it shares with other ecosystems whose species share cetain characteristics or functions, and whose abiotic factors are similar. For example, "rainforest" is a biome, while different rainforests are their own separate ecosystems.
