# Spark ⚡️

# Introduction
Spark is a tool for managing big [[data]] (see [[data wrangling]]). It is really only beneficial to use this instead of [[Pandas]] when we're working with insane amounts of observations. A good rule of thumb is that unless the data will crash your computer, use [[Pandas]]. If it will crash your machine, turn to spark. 

Spark makes use of a [[distributed file system]] to save on storage space.
