# What is nano? 
Nano is a built in terminal editor. It runs entirely through [[command line]], and has no graphical interface. We need to know how to use this kind of thing when working in the cloud, like if we were working through Amazon Web Services.

## Basic commands
| Code | Function
---|---
`nano myfile.py` | open `myfile.py` in nano
simply type | edit a file in nano
ctrl + o, enter | save a file
ctrl + x | exit a file
