## Introduction
The Zettelkasten Method is a [[PKM]] methodology that advocates creating a decentralized network of organically-linked hypertext notes. Each note contains a single idea (see [[atomic notes]]). They system can be navigated via a register of popular jumping-in points and through a series of heterarchical hub notes. 

The system was created by a social scientist named Niklas Luhmann, who set up his system on paper index cards in a giant set of boxes. Today, we can just use computers to do that for us. 

## Advantages
This system is such a game changer when compared with really any other method of taking notes. It allows our ideas to organically grow over time in a way that is frankly addictive. 

## Disadvantages
I think this system, while a serious step up from most note taking methodologies, is a little bit restricive. Really my big problem with it is the idea of [[atomic notes]], which I just don't fully agree with.

## Conclusion
The system that I currently use in [[Obsidian]] is very similar to the Zettelkasten Method, with a few quirks. That's really the only thing that I don't like about this method.
