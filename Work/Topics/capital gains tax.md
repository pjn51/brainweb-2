# Capital gains tax
---
Capital gains tax is a [[personal taxes|tax]] that is levied on the profit that an investor makes when selling an investment. Depending on your income, you will be taxed at a rate of 0%, 15%, or 20% of the profit. 

[[Short-term investments are taxed more]], since they are taxes as regular income rather than subject to this tax rate. This is meant to encourage long-term investment.
