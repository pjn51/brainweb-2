# The Normal Distribution


---
## Introduction
In [[probability]], the normal distribution (aka a Gaussian distribution) is one of the continuous probability [[distributions]] for random variables. 

The general form of its [[probability density function]] is...

$$
f(x)=\frac{ 1 }{ \sigma\sqrt{2\pi} }e^{ -\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2 }
$$

...where...
- $\mu$ = the mean of expectation of the distribution, the [[median]], and the [[mode]]. 
- $\sigma$ = the [[standard deviation]].
