# Number Systems
---
[[We use a decimal number system]]. Our current number system is a *base 10* system, meaning that there are ten possible digits (zero through nine). This is most likely the case because we have ten fingers. [[Our number system emerged due to our biology]]. 

[[Alternate number systems exist]], like [[binary]] which has base two, or [[hexadecimal]] which has base sixteen.
