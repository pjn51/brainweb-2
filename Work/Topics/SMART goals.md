# SMART goals


---
# Introduction
SMART goals are a kind of goal-setting framework to help us create a solid plan for meeting objectives. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

# Specific
The goal must be narrow and answer the questions of *who, what, when, where, and why.*

# Measurable
The goal must have a clear metric of progress and completion.

# Achievable
The goal has to be reasonable and within reach.

# Relevant
The goal must align with long-term plans and values.

# Time-bound
The goal has a set deadline, which will keep me motivated to reach it.
