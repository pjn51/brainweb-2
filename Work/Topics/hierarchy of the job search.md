## Introduction
There's a hierarchy to to the tasks we need to complete for the job search. The foundation for a search lies in our resume (see [[resume workshop]]), LinkedIn, and [[GitHub]] presence. Without a solid online presence where recruiters and possible employers can see what we're all about, we haven't set ourselves up for success.

The next level is the [[networking]] level. We should take a strategic approach to the hunt. I should map out companies and industries to target, and then think about what first degree connections I have to those companies. If I don't have any, then I should start networking more generally, and try and set up informational [[interviews]]. 

After these tasks are completed, we can begin to apply with focus. I can leverage my connections or the [[Metis]] community, and I should be sure to follow up with at least one recruiter after I submit my application if I have to do so cold.
