# Introduction
Probability is the study of the likelihood of theoretical possibilities. It asks, "[[How can we estimate likelihood?]]"

A random experiment is unpredictable in the short term, but probability allows us to predict them in the long term. For example, we canâ€™t predict a coin flip, but we know over time, we will approach a 1:1 ratio of heads and tails. This is called the law of large numbers. 

The *sample space* is the list of all the possible outcomes of an experiment. This is usually denoted by $\Omega$ or S, enclosed in { } separated by commas. An event is a subset of the sample space. For instance, a single roll of a die would be an event, while the sample space for that experiment would be...

$$\Omega = {1,2,3,4,5,6}$$

# Probability measure
This describes the chances that specific event E will occur. We assign a real number to every event such that the sum of all probabilities of all events in the sample space are equal to one. For a coin flip, P(heads) = 0.5 and P(tails) = 0.5. 

P(E) = E / total events possible
