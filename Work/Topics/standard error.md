# Introduction
In [[statistics]], the standard error (SE), is a measure of spread. This is very similar to the [[standard deviation]], but while the standard error uses statistics (sample [[data]]), the standard deviation uses parameters (population data). If that's confusing see [[statistics vs parameters]]. 

The SE tells you how far the sample statistic deviates from the actual population mean. As sample size increases, SE decreases, and the sample mean trends towards the population mean.
