# Introduction
Procreate is a software product designed for creating [[art]] on the iPad.

# Streamline
Turn this up to make the line smoother, and more 'perfect.' It can be scaled from 0% to 100%. 

# Customizing Brushes
We can change a lot of settings in the brush window. We can create new brushes from scratch by clicking the `+` icon. 

# Stroke Properties
We can change the spacing between points when you draw a line. We can also change the jitter to change how these points are distributed as we draw a line

# Taper and Shape
ProCreate can change the way that the brush looks based on lots of things. We can taper either end of the brush stroke, and we can change the basic shape of the brush. For example, we could create a square brush or a circle brush if we wanted. 

This is also where we choose the edge type, either hard or with a gradient. 

# Layers
Layers, layers, layers! This is the heart of Procreate's canvas. Do everything in layers. Since we can edit layers individually, it's never a bad idea to create a new layer.
