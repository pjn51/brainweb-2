# Scrum
---
Scrum is a [[project management]] methodology popular in the world of software development, designed for teams of ten or less workers. The goal is to break down goals into tasks that can be completed in *sprints*, commonly lasting two weeks. 

Another feature of scrum is the *scrum meeting.* These meetings are designed to be 15 minutes or less, and usually happen daily. They're a kind of stand-up meeting. 

At the end of a sprint, the team holds a sprint review, demonstrating work done to stakeholders, and a sprint retrospective, an internal meeting to reflect and discuss the ending sprint.

This methodology can be combined or modified from the standard. One example is [[scrumban]], a combination of scrum and [[kanban]].

Work is broken down into units, sometimes called tickets. There are multiple kinds of tickets - regular ones that produce measureable progress towards goals, or [[spike|spikes]].
