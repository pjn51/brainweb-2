# Root Mean Squre Error (RMSE)
#equation

$$\frac{\sum{\sqrt{(y_p-y_a)^2}}}{n}$$

- $y_p$ = predicted value
- $y_a$ = actual value
- $n$ = number of observations

## Introduction
RMSE is the square root of [[MSE]], and is one of the [[metrics]] we can use to evaluate when performing [[regression]] [[modeling]] tasks.
