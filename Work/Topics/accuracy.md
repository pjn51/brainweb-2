$$
\text{accuracy} = \frac{ \text{correct assignments}}{ \text{correct assignments + false assignments}}

## Introduction
Accuracy is one of the [[metrics]] that we can use for [[classification]] [[modeling]] tasks. It is defined as  correct class assignments as a proportion of all class assignments. 

## Use cases
This is one of the most naive metrics for classification, and it only works in situations where the classes are balanced. As soon as [[class imbalance]] rears its ugly head, accuracy is no longer a meaningful metric.
