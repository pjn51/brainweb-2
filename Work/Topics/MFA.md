# Introduction
Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is an authentication method that requires two or more verification factors. For example, you might have to put in a SMS or email code as well as your password to gain access.

In general, it's a very trustworthy method. However, not all forms of MFA are equally secure. [[Cloud MFAs are trustworthy]], while MFAs from credential are less so, at least in regards to [[My Atos workflow]].
