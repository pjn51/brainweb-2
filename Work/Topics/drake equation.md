--- 
The Drake Equation is a probabilistic argument for the existance of intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] in [[space]]. It was first written in 1961 by Dr. Frank Drake for the purpose of stimulating scientific dialogue at the first conference of [[SETI]]. 

$$ N=R_*\cdot f_\mathrm {p} \cdot n_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {l} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot f_{\mathrm {c} }\cdot L$$

- $N$ = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication may be possible. 
- $R_*$ = the [[average]] rate of star formation in our galaxy.
	- Estimated to be between 1.5 and 3. 
- $f_p$ = the fraction of those stars that have planets.
	- Estimated to be nearly 1. 
- $n_e$ = the average number of planets that can support life per star that has planets.
	- Estimates are controversial
- $f_l$ = the fraction of life-supporting planets that actually develop life at some point.
	- Estimates are controversial
- $f_i$ = the fraction of planets with life that go on to develop *intelligent* life.
	- Estimates are controversial
- $f_c$ = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology capable of interstellar communication (ex. radio).
	- Estimates are controversial
- $L$ = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectible signals into space.
	- Estimates are controversial, ranging from a few hundred years to billions of years.

This equation is more of a conversation-starter than a real tool. The last four parameters are as-of-yet unknown to humanity, and make the range of possible *N* values extremely large. The Drake equation really functions as a roadmap of what information we need to know to determine how hard it would be to discover extraterrestrial intelligence. 

Results range by a factor of 100, far too high to get to a reasonable "answer." An example for a very pessimistic estimate would result in an answer of $N = 9.1 \cdot 10^{-13}$. This means that we are probably alone in the observable universe. A more optimistic approach results in an answer of $N = 15,600,000$ civilizations on 400 billion stars, meaning that we have a lot of neighbors in our galaxy. This still only represents 0.00004% of the stars in our galaxy having civilizations on them.
