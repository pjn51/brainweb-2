# The Hyperbolic Tangent Function
#equation 

---
In [[trigonometry]], *tanh* represents the hyperbolic tangent of an angle x. It is defined as the ratio of the hyperbolic sine and the hyperbolic cosine.

$$
\text{tanh}(x) = \frac{\text{sinh}(x)}{\text{cosh}(x)} = 

\frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1}
$$

This function is often used as an activation function in a [[neural network]].
