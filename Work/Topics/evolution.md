# Evolution

The theory of evolution, also called natural selection, is a critical component of the fields of [[biology]] and [[environmental science]]. This theory has also inspired attempts to replicate the process in [[data science]], namely [[evolutionary algorithms]]. 

Basically, the idea of evolution is that over time, the characteristics of a [[species]] can slowly change through mutation, and these mutations are responsible for the variations we see within species, and ultimately the development of new species altogether. In this way, [[Isolation causes differentiation]].

Changes to a species' characteristics are driven by other environmental factors that make some mutations more beneficial than others. Mutations that help an organism survive or reproduce more are said to increase the *fitness* of the organism, and over time, these mutations will begin to predominate.
