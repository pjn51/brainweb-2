A logarithm is a way of expressing the answer to the question: "How many (*a*) of number *b* do we have to multiply by itself to get number *c*?" It is often used in [[calculus]]. 

The basic form of a logartihm is
$$
log_b(a) = c
$$

# Logarithms and exponents
A logartithm is kind of a reverse exponent. An exponent tells us the result (*a*) of multiplying a number *b* by itself *c* times.

$$
b^c = a
$$
