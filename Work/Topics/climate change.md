## A conceptual model of Earth's climate
Entropy - the concept that whenever energy changes forms, it's ability to do work decreases. 

Whenever energy is absorbed, it is re-radiated by the object that absorbed it. 

## Radiative forcing
Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a given factor has on the overall balance of incoming / outgoing energy. It is defined by the following equation.

$$
\triangle T_s = \lambda \triangle F
$$

In this equation, $\triangle T_s$ refers to the change in surface temperature (celsius), and $\lambda$ refers to climate sensitivity (in watts per square meter), and $\triangle F$ refers to change in readiative forcing (in watts per square meter).

## The Stefan-Boltzmann Law
[[The Stefan-Boltzmann Law describes power emitted from a blackbody in terms of its temperature]].

This is defined by the following equation.

$$
I[\frac{W}{m^2}] = \epsilon \cdot \sigma[\frac{W}{m^2k^4}] \cdot T[K]^4
$$

...where $\epsilon$ is emissivity, between zero and one, $\sigma$ is a constant ($5.68 \cdot 10^{-8}$), $I$ is radiation intensity (watts per square meter). $T$ is temperature in kelvin.

This is a *blackbody radiation model.* It assumes that all incoming radiation is absorbed and re-radiated. 

## Earth's Radiation Budget and the Greenhouse Effect
[[Most energy is solar]]. This means that based on the emmitance of the Sun's light, we can calculate what the temperature of the Earth supposedly is according to the above law. However, when we do this we find that the Earth is supposed to be much colder than it is, too cold to sustain most life. 

The reason that the Earth really isn't that cold is *the greenhouse effect.* [[The greenhouse effect increases Earth's temperature]]. When energy hits the Earth's surface and is re-radiated back towards space, it collides with the atmosphere. The gasses within the atmosphere absorb the energy, and re-radiate some of it upwards, and some of it downwards. In this way, energy is kept near to the Earth for much longer than it would have been without an atmosphere.

The atmosphere doesn't absorb energy equally well at all wavelengths. The atmosphere is best at absorbing energy that has been radiated by the earth, but not good at absorbing direct solar energy. This is why the greenhouse effect doesn't prevent energy from reaching the Earth, it only prevents the removal of energy from the system. 

## Greenhouse Gasses
Different GHGs have different *global warming potential* (GHP). This is a scale defined by the warming power of $CO_2$. Carbon dioxide has a GHP of 1. This is the reason [[Climate change is anthropogenic]].
