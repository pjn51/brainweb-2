# Object-Oriented Programming
---
[[Python is object-oriented]]. That means that we can create our own objects, which [[Python]] calles *classes.*

# Inheritance
[[Python objects can inherit attributes]]. 

# Polymorphism
Different object classes can share method names. These methods will exist independently of one another. 

Two classes can have a method called `abc()` but those two methods could do entirely different things. 

# Working with Special Methods
[[Python objects can use special methods]].
