# A/B testing
---
A/B testing is a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. We use this sort of test to determine what effect will occur when we change the variable. 

A common A/B test would be in the context of sending marketing emails. We change the email subject line for half of the recipients, and look at the rate at which they open the emails. This tells us what subject line is preferable. 

At [[Indeed]], we can conduct A/B testing via [[TestStats]].
