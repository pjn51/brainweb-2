# Agile project management
---
Agile project management, often just called "agile," is a school of [[project management]] that focuses on iteration within cross-functional teams.

Frameworks within agile include [[scrum]], [[kanban]], and their child, [[scrumban]]. These frameworks share certain key characteristics, such as their use of [[team velocity]] as a metric.

The term originated in [[The Agile Manifesto (2001)]].
