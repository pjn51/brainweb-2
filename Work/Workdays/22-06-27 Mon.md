# Notes
A pretty light day for meetings. I want to ask [[Syed]] what I should be doing with my downtime at this point, since the number of meetings per week has dramatically declined. He said that I should start on the self-guided onboarding trainings, so I'm gonna schedule some. 

In the afternoon, I'm spending some time reviewing the [IQL Cheat Sheet](https://wiki.indeed.com/display/IQL/IQL+Cheat+Sheet) in order to get used to [[IQL]] syntax, which seems very similar to [[SQL]] so far.
