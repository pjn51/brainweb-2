# Notes
Today I'm going to complete [[IQL - b2i session six]] and review the overall [[Cronjob|CRON]] process so that I can close out my tickets. This is the last day of the sprint. I also need to write some tickets for Monday I think. 

I created a [ticket](https://bugs.indeed.com/browse/DPE-4012) for getting [[Kerberos]] access, which is blocking me from doing hands-on [[Cronjob|CRON]] stuff
