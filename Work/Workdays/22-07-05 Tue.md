# Notes
Today is the first workday in our new townhouse. Let's see if the high speed internet makes a noticeable difference in my video quality.

My primary monitor keeps turning off - at this point I'm just hoping it's a power cord issue and not a monitor issue lol. UPDATE: it was just a cord issue.

I got my first two tickets today,[[4606 - SPIKE Midapply feedback Labeler Cronjob]] and [[4607 - Learn how to write a Cronjob]]. Exciting! But now I actually have work to do lol. And there are only four workdays for me in this sprint! I'm planning on taking most of my organization to [[JIRA]] so that I can get credit for it. The notes for each ticket will just be used as a redirect to the JIRA ticket page.

I'm also completing [[IQL - b2i session three]].

I created some meeting notes so that I can ask [[Dan]] questions about the [[Ishbook]] related to [[4606 - SPIKE Midapply feedback Labeler Cronjob|SQMEASURE - 4606]]. ^1
