# Notes
Today is my first day of work at [[home]]. I'm just now getting this separate vault set up so that I can keep work-related and personal notes separate. One day, I may combine them, so I should take care not to do anything that would prevent that from happening. 

I have a lot of tasks to get oriented towards. Syed provided me an [onboarding document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KGgrdPR3BU4Yl_djSIA-lV8_Li5tA2_rcmEVe4C1q0E/edit#gid=1835049216) that I'll begin grinding through, and I also have a [Degreed task list](https://degreed.com/plan/2175725) for new hires.
