# Meetings
1. [[22-07-19 JS OPS Feedback effort consolidation]]

# Notes
Today we're going to head into the [[Seattle 2+U office]] to crank out some work. I need to remember to refactor [[22-07-18 Midapply cron planning]]. This will be a good day to get work done, since I only have one meeting.

Today I actually started writing code! This is my 21st workday, so it's about time.
