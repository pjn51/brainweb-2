# Notes
I didn't think I'd be working today, but my parents left earlier than expected so here I am. Because I had this day listed for PTO, I don't have any meetings and can just use this as an extra day to work on my tickets and [[IQL - b2i session five]]. 

I spent the afternoon reviewing the code related to the [SERP relevancy indexbuilder](https://code.corp.indeed.com/squallops/serprelevancy_indexbuilder/-/tree/master) written by [[Lynn]]. It would be nice to have her walk me through the intricacies of what's going on here.
