# Notes
I'm headed to the [[Seattle 2+U office]] this morning for a tour. In the afternoon, I'm working on the [[Indeed Data Education course]]. I also want to take some notes on [[Technical Analyst expectations]]. 

I have a Q: It seems like I got a different answer for the same [[IQL]] query between an [[Ishbook]] and the web app. What's up? ^1
