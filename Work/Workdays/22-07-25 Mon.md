# Meetings
1. [[22-07-25 PQM standup]]

# Notes
Only one meeting today! The meetings / week has decreased significantly. Only 3.8 hours of meetings this week means I'll have time to work on coding a lot. It seems like my [[Kerberos]] access is imminent as well.

Today I'm going to be working on the code base for the [[Midapply Feedback queue]] [[Labeler]] [[Cronjob]] and wrapping up an examination of the docs for all the [[PM queues]].
