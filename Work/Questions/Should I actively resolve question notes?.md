# Should I actively resolve question notes?
Maybe actively "solving" question notes would allow me to progress within the brainweb faster, creating new ideas. If I did this, it would allow question notes to act as temporary scratchpads for me to generate new insights and connections. Once I felt that I've come to a solution, I could remove the question.

On the other hand, why remove the question in the end? Couldn't I just create some new idea notes and continue my thoughts there?
