# How can we organize data?
The [[array]] is the simplest method to organize [[data]]. If we want to have a flexible size, we can use a [[linked list]]. However, [[Most programming languages use dynamically sized arrays]]. 

A [[binary search tree]] is another way to organize data. A [[heap]] is a different form of tree.
