# How can we understand RAJ feedback?
This is an important aspect of the question: [[How can we understand user feedback?]]

[[Report A Job queue|RAJ]] has specific limitations related to user feedback. [[Indeed]] is under an ethical and legal obligation to make reporting malicious and illegal behavior as easy as possible. Apparently the UX team has found that making any barriers to text entry results in decreased feedback. ^1

Unfortunately, this means that RAJ feedback has to be classified manually using [[Labeler]].
