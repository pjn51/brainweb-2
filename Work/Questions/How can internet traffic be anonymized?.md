*How can internet traffic be anonymized?* The internet relies heavily on [[cryptography]], specifically [[public-key cryptography]]. However, we can go even farther in anonymizing not only the content of our communication, but our identity. 

One method is by using [[Tor]]. We can use Tor as a user attempting to anonymously access content because [[Tor utilizes onion routing to conceal user location]]. We can even host content anonymously. [[Onion services are an attempt to anonymize server identity]], however [[Onion services have some weaknesses]].
