# Should I create running meeting notes?
On one hand, I want to have as much atomicity as possible, because [[atomic notes]] just seem to be a better way to map information together. 

On the other hand, having a running document emphasizes the continuity of the discussion, and allows me to quickly reference back to the previous meeting.
