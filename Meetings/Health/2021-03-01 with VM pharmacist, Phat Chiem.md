- Side effects to watch out for
	- Fatigue
	- Abdomial pain
	- Headache
	- Nausea
- I need to get a script for [[azathioprine]] to prevent my body from forming antibodies to the [[remicade]]. I'll probably be on aza for about a year since antibodies typically form in the first year.
- I'll take a lower dose for a week, and then increase the dose. It's based on weight. 
- ==I should start azathioprine immediatley==
- Azathioprine side effects
	- Nausea. ==Take with food!!!==
	- Liver toxicity, skin cancer, lymphoma 
- My enzyme activity to metabolize the azo was normal in Feb. 
- If I have a fever over 100.5 for more than a day, call VM. 
- No impact on COVID vaccine. But I should wait until I'm off the prednisone so that I get all the protection. The azo and remicade might reduce the effectivness *a little bit* but not that much. 
- Remicade risks
	- Increased risk for lymphoma and skin cancer. We will monitor for these two every so often
	- Allergic reaction to the infusion is a possibility. These can be treated with antihistamines. 
	- Liver toxicity and anemia are possible. 
	- Confusion
	- Elevated risk for lupus
- Lymphoma risk numbers
	- Very low in the first year  6:10,000 compared to 2:10,000 in the general population
	- Pancreatitis is something I should watch for
- I should get all my vaccines in order before I go on the azathioprine. 
	- I should get a pneumonia vaccine ASAP at QFC. 2 shot series. 
	- I should get a tetanus vaccine as well but I could do this later. 

==Note: I got my second hep b vaccine and a pneumonia shot on 3-1-21==
