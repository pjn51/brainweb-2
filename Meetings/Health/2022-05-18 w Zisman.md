# ‚úÖ Topics to discuss
- Getting labs during infusion (look up which ones I need to have done)
- Current weight of 160
	- Is weight gain associated with remicade?
- How did Zisman decide on gastroenterology as a speciality?
- I got [[COVID-19]]

# ‚úèÔ∏è Notes
- Jan colonoscopy looked good so I stopped [[azathioprine]]. Just on [[remicade]]
- We will continue the infusions alone, get labs along with these. We will check infliximab drug level before the next infusion to make sure things are going well
- These meds can loose effect if the dose is too low. So if we check periodically, we can prolong use
- If liver enzyme is still elevated, we look for chronic liver inflammation or other conditions that increase liver enzyme levels
- ==I should get my flu shots in the fall==
- Azathioprine is associated with worse COVID outcomes, it was good that I wasn't on it when I got covid
- My covid infection functions as another booster, so I'm pretty good to go. Reinfection within 120 days is very uncommon
- He can order labs for my welness deal, but he isn't the person to follow up with in terms of the result since he doesn't treat high colesterol, for instance
- ==I should get a primary care provider
- ==I'm due for pneumonia vaccination, he will send it to QFC, "numavax"==
- Next colonoscopy in July 2023
- Repeat bone density test decided by the bone people
- No weight gain assocated with remicade, my body is just returning to a healthy weight as I absorb more nutrients
- The majority of people lose response by the five-year mark but we're doing the best practices that we know of
