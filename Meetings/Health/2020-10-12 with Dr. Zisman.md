Get the HEP B vaccine! I can get this done at Virginia Mason through a nurse visit in the Lindeman pavilion. I should call and see if I need an appointment. 

I can get a pneumonia vaccine at the same time. 

## [[osteoperosis]]
My case is significant. First line treatment is calcium, vitamin D, and exercise.
My vitamin D level is sufficient, so I’m all good with that. 

Weight bearing exercise like running or weight lifting. 

They sometimes send people to an endocrinologist to do further research into the bone density stuff, but this isn’t needed right now for me. 

We should repeat this test in a year or two. 

Active disease, steroids, and being underweight make this worse. If we avoid these factors, we can reverse the thinning. 

Bone density can be increased until my 20s, then it declines. 

I’m more than 2sd below normal density (1st percentile!!). 

I should get a colonoscopy to check for colon cancer and to update my disease progress in 2021. 

I got my flu shot and my Hep B vaccine on 10/14!
