Asked to be a TA! (5 out of 50 were asked)

I want to investigate if this is more of a business intelligence role, or a data science role. Business int. tends to start with a formula or method of calculating something, and then the analyst does so. In data science, we start with a question and the raw data, and the scientist selects the best approach to answer the question. Both play the role of providing data-based facts for management decisions, but data science is more free form, more risky, and more rewarding than BI. BI works with 'known unknowns' while data science works with 'unknown unknowns,' answering questions that haven't been answered before.

I have experience in the startup environment at Stashlogix. I know that when you're part of a small company, you often have to be flexible with your role and focus on the end goal. My job might not just be to work on a small slice of the company's needs and clock out at the end of the day, my job is to direct my skills wherever they are needed within the company.

trace software is main business. on retail side, they partner with conbase for POS. they want to monetize data which they have quite a bit of. lots of WA and OR retailers use DAUNTLESS. they have millions of monthly transactions and that's growing!
