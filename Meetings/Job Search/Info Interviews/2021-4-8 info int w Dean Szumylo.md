## Questions to ask
### What does an average week look like for you? What tools and platforms do you use, and what projects do you apply them to? How long are you working on a project on average?

They have lots of divisions, working on all parts of the data gathering - processing - analysis process. 

Data gathering people are more engineering types. Field work stuff. 

### What has your career trajectory been like? Where and when did you get the relevant skills that allow you to do the work you do today?

Background in gis, got certicifcate after grad school. He found that was more marketable than environmental stuff generally. Pitfall was that at the time he was interested in regional conservation planning but got pidgeoinholed as a GIS guy. He recommends not letting that happen to me. The first few jobs you get defines what employers see you as. 

Recommends highligithing that i understand the environmental mission of the firm. This helps me to be a bridge between the two sides - env and stats / computer. 

Those who excel at crossing between industries tend to have an online presence that demonstrates this. Periodically, some folks pull up interesting articles and applications that connect these fields. 

### I see that you've had experience working as a contractor and directly for the government. What are the differences that you've noticed between these two experiences?

At NOAA a lot of new hires had the ability to synthesize data sources. He's never been a direct govt employee but his wife is. Based on her experiences, the feds are very structured. There's a level of comfort there and there are lots of protections there. Very clear career ladders and performance reviews. This can also be suffocating. Lots of waiting in line for promotions. Those who advance tend to be creative in finding ways to move laterally to climb faster. 

In the private sector, contracting has a bad rep for boring assignments with no support from home company and no federal benefits. Lynker is different! They have more opportunities to dabble in different things. He does project management, managing teams, and there are opportunities to do other things like make good connections between teams. This means you have to have a dynamic mindset to find pain points and solutions. 

### What is the role that [[data science]] tools play in your workflow? Things like classification and regression models, predictive analysis, etc. Do you use python directly, or integrated with GIS software, or not at all?

Firmly ESRI shop. Lynker is their business partner. NOAA uses ESRI as well. Data stuff comes from Insights by ESRI. Some orgs are open-source shops which have pros and cons. You have to show that if you get stuck, there's a robust support community. 

### Do you know anything about the Water Resources Data Scientist role at Lynker? Can you connect me to someone who I can talk more with about this role?

Their water protection contract is based out of Alabama. Thats where the HQ is but there are offices in Boulder CO. Some folks end up there, or end up working remotely. The position might only be remote during COVID. 

### Can you introduce me to anyone else who you think I have common backgrounds / interests with? Especially if they're working for a company that might be hiring for something I could fit into.

Some peolle on the Ocean Systems contract under Melissa do modeling. But modeling sometimes comes up in other places, like modeling fish stock assessments.
