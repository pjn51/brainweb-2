# Informational interview with Jason Salazar-Adams, Monday, June 14th, 2021
`TAGS:` #meeting/career

---
I scheduled this interview because of an available Data Scientist role at Starbucks. However, the role is no longer being advertised on their website, so this is just a general meeting to talk about the [[data science industry]]. 

## My questions
- What was your [[career]] path before [[Metis]]?
	- Education
	- Work experience
- What was the bootcamp like for you? SEA cohort?
- What has happened since graduation?
- How do you like working for Starbucks?
	- Company culture, work-life balance
	- Type of work
	- Hiring process
- Current trends and landscape
	- What are the current trends in the field that I should be aware of?
	- How do you keep up with developments?
- Wrap up
	- Am I qualified for positions there?
	- Can you recommend me just based on my Metis experience? What is Starbucks generally looking for?
	- What should I be working on to make myself a more desirable candidate?
	- Is there anyone you can put me in touch with who would be willing to chat?

## About me
- ESCI undergrad
- Metis bootcamp online
- Teaching Assistant
- Projects
	- [[wildfire classifier]]
	- [[adjective assisted album aggregation]]
	- [[stash-o-matic project]]
		- These models can be complex
		- Look up...
			- Economic order quantity (EOQ model). 
			- If the demand is normally distrubuted, we can do statistics to limit run-out probability to a certain percentage
			- Time series models should automatically take seasonality into account. 

## Discussion
- Undergrad in math, lib arts school
- Grad degree in ops research (mathematical optimization)
	- Given a forecast what should we do based on that output
	- Deterministic, business oriented
- Worked as an analyst for a little bit before metis, then pivoted to software
- Delivering software as main role

Interview: They asked how to estimate a drivers time spent unloading at each store, asked how to build a predictive model to refine this estimate. 

[[NLP]] at starbucks: DeepBrew and CoffeeTalk. Analysis of reviews, food safety complaint monitoring. 

Keeping up: they have weekly continuous learning, self driven and self led. He reads software engineering books and reads on Medium. 

He's moving towards software engineering since he wants to get involved in model *deployment* and reproduceability.
