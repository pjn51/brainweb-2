# ðŸ“° News updates

	- Approval has dropped from 53% to 46% since his inaguration

# â˜­ Political discussion: [[Why the US Doesn't Have a Mass Workers' Party (2021)]]
## JT's leadoff
- Tom's background
	- Has a ton of labor experience and general workers' movement experience
- Article overview
	- Provides a historical account of the attempts to form mass workers' parties, and a call to action
- History of our usage of the slogan
	- This used to be more abstract
	- We had this on the platform ten years ago, before the rise of the [[DSA]] and other events
- The [[Democratic Party]] has been the main focus of the US left after the 50s, which sucks
- The lack of a [[workers' party]] is not permanent
- We apply [[dialectical materialism]] to this situation --> change is always happening
- The lack of a mass party = contradiction
- One way or another, this contradiction will be resolved over time
- The balance of forces and leadership will detemine when and how this is resolved
- What is a mass workers' party?
- Failure of the left-right dichotomy to represent classes within society
- "The left" is meaningless, the [[proletariat]] is concrete
- The culture wars reflect the degeneration of politics along amorphous, non-class lines
- Mass movements are cut across by the lack of a political vehicle
- The [[June 2020 uprising]] could have been the beginning of a revolution if its energy could be organized, carried forward to the political level
- The class struggle is complex, inter-related events and experiences. The energy of the workers dissipates, then regenerates
- The class struggle can be fought out in many ways: strikes, protests, [[unions|union]] drives, and theoretically through the publications of the working class fighting against the ideas of the [[bourgeoisie]]. 
- [[identity politics]], [[postmodernism]], and [[idealism]] need to be directly combatted, especially for the sake of forming and educating the [[vanguard]]. 
- The class struggle affects [[class consciousness]], which tends to lag behind material reality as people learn the lessons of the past slowly
- Under the hammer blow of events, consciousness can catch up rapidly
- Characteristics of a mass workers' party
	- A mass workers' party needs to have *mass*
	- It needs to represent the interests of the working class
- As a workers' party moves along, there will be internal battle with revolutionary and [[reformism|reformist]] sides
- The crisis of capitalism aids the revolutionary side of this battle in some ways
- We can see with Corbyn that workers' parties with bourgeois leadership can be retaken (temporarily in this case)
- Historically, the [[petty bourgeoisie]] has dominated the foundation of labor parties here in the [[USA]]
- When the Great Depression happened, class became more of a political topic
- Racism has been a useful tool to cut across the foundation of unions, parties, and alliances of all kinds
- [[USA|American]] economic expansion has also put the brakes on the formation and clarification of the labor movement here. 
- Marxists should stand at the front line of the workers' movement, and make [[Marxists should use positive demands]] on that movement
- We meet the workers' movement where it's at, and move it forward step by step

## My intervention
- Speak to the tragedy of [[Socialist Alternative]] in [[Seattle]]
- Weather is to climate as concrete predictions are to abstract
- Independent candidates vs class independent party
	- Well-meaning candidates
	- Win office (sometimes)
	- Face political realities (cooperate or be cast out)
	- Sink to the level of the surrounding environment
	- Need for a party backbone to hold individual politicians accountable
- Example of DSA in SEA
	- Spreading-out of support due to non-exclusive campaign groups
	- Inability to learn from mistakes
