# Notes
- Tabling reception
	- Hard to predict where good reception will be
	- When we prepare, there will be *some* success
	- Make sure you're getting more out of it than you're putting in
	- When hostile people approach, disengage
	- Young people are the target demographic
- Paper sales vs contacts
	- Older people are more likely to buy a paper, students and youth are more likely to become contacts without buying a paper
- *A Letter to Sherman Stanley*
	- He was leading member of [[SWP (USA)]] at the time
	- Allied with Max [[Shachtman]]
	- Took the position that the [[Russia|USSR]] was no longer a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|workers' state]]
	- They said that there was a new bureaucratic class arising that they termed "state capitalism"
	- The petty bourgeois organizational method isn't the hard work of changing minds, but just putting your position out there and damning your enemies
- The Fourth International
	- [[People & Organizations/Trotsky]] was forced to accept all those who were anti-[[Comintern]], leading to a powerful sector of the petty bourgeois. 
- [[WW2]] and revolution
	- Comintern played a really negative role
	- National liberation movements had to either become puppets of the Kremlin, or forge a different path
	- Trotsky was wrong about a postwar collapse. The [[USA]] prevented this, and was able to guarantee free trade worldwide after the war. 
		- The new impetus to market expansion helped to revive the world market
