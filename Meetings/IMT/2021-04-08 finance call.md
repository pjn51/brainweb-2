In some areas, the current system needs an upgrade.

Finance officer elections is where the democratic element is found with regard to the finances. 

If we use [[IMT]] tax id, the IMT has to account for those assets come tax time. They have to report on it. Therefore, the national center would need to be the formal owner of the account. 

As we become more professional, more controls for finances are needed. For a bank account, it raises the questions of who has access, the standards, etc. We need a separation of duties. Perhaps one person could keep track of the record, and the other person has the physical [[currency|money]].

One solution would be to set up a chapter banking sort of thing. This sort of thing is done by fraternities and organizations like that. 

The international doesn't have as much of a problem with finance, because the US is unusually large. This allows finance to be much more centralized. Most branches don't have any financial pool at all. 

In NY, they operate in a centralized fashion since the Center is in the city. No need for distributed finances. 

Large branches operate on the venmo system. They're running into issues with centralism vs distributed stuff when there are multiple branches per city.
