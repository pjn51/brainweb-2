- We're discussing [[The State and Revolution (1917)#5 The Economic Basis for the Withering Away of the State|The State and Revolution, ch.5]].
- *How do [[bourgeoisie|capitalists]] have more political influence than [[proletariat|workers]]?*
	- The various trivial restrictions, the crushing of workers' spirits, the media, the funding of campaigns. See *Marxist Classics v.1*, p.152.
	- [[Socialism will increase leisure time]]
- *How would the democracy of [[socialism]] differ from the democracy of [[capitalism]]?*
	- Extension, [[Quantity transforms into quality]], lack of prestige, lack of careerism in the absence of private property. 
- *Why would the absence of classes entail a withering away of the [[state]]?*
	- [[States are instruments of class domination]] - no classes = no function.
	- Workers' army --> workers' militia --> absorption of militia into society represents dissolution of the state
- *Why, in a socialist society, would a worker not recieve 'the full product of their labor' as [[Lassalle]] puts it?*
	- Need to expand production, therefore need for surplus value accumulation. [[Labor will still be required after capitalism]]. 
- *What does [[Lenin]] mean by '[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] right' and why is it still present in the lower stage of communism?*
	- [[Mode of production and appropriation are distinct]], lower stage.
