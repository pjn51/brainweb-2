# DSA work
- Background
	- CC has been blocked from attending Tacoma [[DSA]] meetings due to [[IMT]] membership
- My intervention
	- I would be interested in seeing if SEA DSA has the same attitude
	- We aren't really at a place where DSA work is vital, but I want to keep all doors open
	- I know Remy Cahill, a member of Reform & Revolution caucus. They would most likely be open to our attendance
	- Members of [[Socialist Alternative]] have been entering SEA DSA, which will complicate matters
- JT's intervention
	- SEA DSA is not a priority right now
	- We should prioritize student work and independent activity
	- CC should not have done all those things independently
		- Reaching out, communicating, and offering to resign
		- He should have thought more carefully about the reply, and made a case for why he should be allowed to participate
	- Any platform work needs to be carried through on the basis of the whole organization, not just independently
	- Be careful with Ramy and those like him
- JW's intervention
	- He has engaged with DSA on an case-by-case basis
	- Ramy is sort of a snake

# JT visiting WA
- My intervention
	- When does BHAM want to host a meeting? I think that Saturday afternoon would be ideal
	- I will try to secure RSVPs at branch on Saturday
	- For those who cannot attend BHAM meeting, JT can set up one-on-one discussions in SEA
- JT's intervention
	- Timeline
		- Arrive on the 17th at 10am
		- Will need a place to stay
		- Sunday: drive to BHAM, strategic planning meeting
		- Leave on the 21st at 12pm
	- Prioritize SEA one-on-one meetings 
	- Meeting content
		- 4.5 hour discussion
		- Three leadoffs (30 min each)
			- JT: organizational perspective
			- PN: SEA perspectives
			- JW: BHAM perspectives
		- SWOT analysis

# AOB
- My intervention
	- Is it appropriate to use branch funds to subsidize travel costs to the National Congress?
	- Coordinating plane tickets to the National Congress (in five weeks)
		- Fly in on Friday, leave on Monday? --> tickets are around $300 right now
		- Stay at the Holiday Inn Express, must book by Sept 20 --> $129 per room, sleeps 4 comrades
		- Total cost so far: $357 per comrade, including $25 attendance fee
- JT's intervention
	- Leave the branch 2 months of funds, then we can vote on using that money for plane tickets
- JW's intervention
	- He wants to get comrades to RSVP for the Congress
	- JW, DM, and likely TM attending
	- Alaska Air booked
