# [[Imperialism - The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)]]
- My intervention
	- Buzzword of "small business [[capitalism]]" existed long ago
	- Trend towards concentration of production
		- Trend towards *socialization* of production
		- Heightening of contradiction between collective production and individual profit
	- Economic planning grows simpler by the year
		- New technology
		- Firms are already conducting economic planning, with small datasets and redundancy
	- Banks and their new role
		- Example of OnlyFans credit card issues
			- Banks, not the public, are the final say in which businesses fail or succeed
		- Integration of the Federal Reserve and the banks for monetary policy
	- Socialist production as a continuation of existing trends
		- Not an abandonment of the good aspects of [[capitalism]]
		- The logical conclusion of monopoly capitalism is [[socialism]]
		- Just socializing the FAANG tech companies and the major banks would tip the scales towards social production in the [[USA]]
	-  What this means for us today
		- Easier to organize
			- The contradictions are more obvious than ever
			- It's obvious to most that this isn't rational
			- Example of the civil war in [[Russia]] <-- not our issue today
		- Easier to plan and run the economy
			- AI and ML technology could easily be used for economic planning
			- Transition from the "governance of people" to the "management of things" as [[Lenin]] said in [[The State and Revolution (1917)]]

# Planning next paper sale
- My intervention
	- We should orient to the campuses for the Fall Offensive
	- We should buy some stickers and print some posters (we have something like $350 available)
	- We have a stock of 4 pamphlets and 22 SR27, 4 IDOM (for comrades), 1 SR24, and 1 SR26. No need to order more papers IMO unless we plan on increasing tabling frequency
