We're discussing [[Theses on Feuerbach (1845)]] and [[Marx's Revolution in Philosophy (2013)]]. 

[[idealism]] is really absurd when we examine it directly, but it is a little slippery when we don't really nail it down and force it to defend itself. Of course ideas do exist and they cause people to act a certain way, but [[materialism]] asks *why* certain ideas exist.

## Theses on Feurbach
## One
We have to think about the relationship between the observer and that which is observed. We can't treat human thought and actions with separate rules which we don't apply to the rest of the universe. This is a dualism that [[Marx]] seeks to break down.

## Two
Since the world is real, we can test out our ideas in the real world, both by looking backwards to explain past events, and using these ideas to predict the future of events. 

## Three
The relationship between ideas and the material world is a two-way street. Our ideas cause us to change the material world, and the material world causes our ideas to change. 

## Four
Feuerbach did something cool by pointing out how the [[religion|religious]] world is developed out of a material need for [[religion]], but he doesn't go further with this analysis.

The reason for the development of religious afterlife is the hellish experience of the real world. Marx takes this line of reasoning further, that we must therefore try and change the real world so it isn't so horrible.

## Five
Marx is saying that Feuerbach is sort of on the right track, but he doesn't apply materialist analysis to the actual action of contemplating something. 

## Six
 Feuerbach's failure to place the secular world in its historical context means that he has to generalize and create historical abstractions. 

## Seven
Feuerbach also fails to consider that the religious sentiment that he ascribes to all humans is really due to the 'ensemble of the social relations,' not some innate quality of all humans.

## Skipping to Thesis Ten
Civil society indicates a static, unchanging view of humanity, while social humanity indicates that we are analyzing humanity in its entire diversity of form. 

## Eleven
Marxists set out to use philosophy as a tool to change the world, not merely for intellectual masturbation. We test out our models of the world in the heat of class struggle, taking lessons from those struggles that inform our theory.
