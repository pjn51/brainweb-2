## Current events
There are waves of protest of [[petty bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]] character, and waves of strikes at major employers such as Amazon and Target. 

## Political discussion on The Balance Sheet of October
>Unlike the development of [[capitalism]], which relies on the market for the allocation of resources, a nationalised economy requires conscious planning and direction. This cannot be undertaken successfully by a handful of bureaucrats in Moscow, even if they were [[Marx]], [[Engels]], [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]]. Such a state of affairs requires the involvement of the mass of the population in the running of industry and [[state]]. Only a regime of workersâ€™ democracy would be capable of harnessing the talent and initiative of society. A regime of bureaucratic mismanagement would inevitably lead to the eventual seizure of the economy as it became more sophisticated and technologically advanced.
