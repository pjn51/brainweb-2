# â˜­ Political discussion
## My leadoff
- Political context of Seattle, our history, and our future
- Main themes are flexibility, sacrifice, and optimism
 
### Political context of Seattle
- Waters may be calm now, but use the Marxist method!
- Sectarians and opportunists cling to what they can see in front of them
	- SA --> Sawant
	- DSA --> Nicole Thomas-Kennedy for City Attourney, Nikita Oliver for City Council
- [[Socialist Alternative]]
	- SAlt has a few hundred members in Seattle
	- Dedicated to preventing the rightwing recall campaign against councilmember Sawant
	- Recall represents a backlash against the events of last summer, despite the fact that SA didn't do that much to accelerate or guide the movement
	- They didn't raise the horizons, they watered down the demands for total abolition by saying "let's be realistic here and vote to defund by 50%, or just tax Amazon some more"
	- We should defend Sawant regardless
	- But we should point out that it was a mistake to try and run Sawant in the first place without a mass party to support her run
	- SA is now trapped in an electoral cycle of eternal challenges
	- Their victory has become their weakness
	- Poisoning the well a little bit with attempts to gain money on the street
- [[DSA]]
	- Thousands of members in Seattle
	- Currently putting all their weight behind Nikita Oliver for city council
	- Also support Nicole Thomas-Kennedy for city attorney
	- A self-proclaimed prison abolitionist who will doubtless be forced to walk back on these promises on day one in the job
	- This represents an inability to see past campaign promises to defund the police, etc 
	- Independent candidates with no party apparatus behind them will just slowly sink into the swamp of horse trading politics, and inevitably betray each promise, one by one
- These actions reflect pessimism and ultimately despair and lack of confidence in the workers
- The [[June 2020 uprising]]
	- No pre-existing leadership 
	- Leaders emerged organically from the black youth
	- Largest protest drew 60,000 people
	- CHOP represented a massive victory against the state apparatus
	- Clear demonstration of the thirst for change
	- Total inability of the sects to take advantage or guide the movement
	- Desperate need for leadership, structure that a revolutionary organization could have provided
	- Instead, CHOP faced the contradiction of orienting to the working class and the interests of the lumpenproletariat until the contradictory class character of the camp resulted in its defeat
	- A movement ultimately can't reflect the full interests of two classes at the same time. The anarchists in the movement chose to orient to the lumpen, and the camp lost the support of most workers as shootings and violence emerged in the absence of any organization that the workers could have provided
	- This is NOT to say that we don't pity the situation of the lumpen in seattle, but we must firmly orient to the working class to lead any revolutionary change. It is through WORKING CLASS organization that any improvements to the lives of the homeless will arrive
- Landscape overview
	- Ultras to the left of me, [[opportunism|opportunists]] to the right! 
	- Orientation to visible candidates and offices reflects lack of clear perspectives, lack of trust in the workers
	- Desperate need for leadership and backbone --> desperate need for Marxist cadre
	- Would replace the disconnected mess of the [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] and ultraleft sects, and lend a clear revolutionary purpose to the stagnant electoralism and class collaborationism of the opportunist left
	- Massive opening for a genuine Bolshevik tendency here
	- Little space in the workers' minds for these sects
- We should be excited to be working in such a mess!
- In Lenin's day, the organizational questions had to be debated out without as much evidence of the failures of anti-Marxist methods
- Today, we only have to look to the past year and a half to see the lessons on full display to whoever wants to look
- The clear need to orient to the working class, the clear need for organization, the clear need to overturn capitalism in order to challenge oppression

### Our past
- Numbers
	- Sold 22 papers since May, we've had 15 contacts. Selling 3.6 papers per tabling session on avg. 
	- Membership has fluctuated from 2 to 7 to our current 4 active members
	- Process of consolidation of our most active, dedicated comrades
	- This is a positive process at work!
- We have clarified and reinforced our core 
- This has been a period of pumping the brakes a little bit
- A period of transition
- Dialectics teaches us that we're always in a period of transition!
- We need to get out of the mindset of conservatism, the mindset of holding ourselves back, and get down to business

### Our future
- Massive student work opportunity here
	- 7 thousand at Seattle U
	- 7 thousand more at Seattle Central
	- 46 thousand students at UW!
- If one third of young people have positive views of Marxism, that means there are 20 thousand students who might be interested in talking or grabbing a paper, maybe even attending a public event. 8,200 communists. If one out of every two hundred wants to join, we will be flooded with too many new members to handle! 
- Meeting space difficulty
	- Pakistan

### Conclusion 
- We must accept that revolutionary socialism is a minority position today
	- Two choices: we water down our principles, seek to gather a base as quickly as possible, and obliterate ourselves
	- Or, we work patiently but thoroughly to bring the ideas of genuine Marxism to those who are interested, knowing that more and more are interested every day (commit to Bolshevism)
- Need to commit to the methods of Bolshevism
	- Only proven method for organizing a revolutionary force
	- Professionalism
	- Tactical flexibility
	- Theoretical resolve
- If the national slogan is "forward to 500," our slogan may be more like "forward to five" but we should be no less excited about this prospect, no less energetic, and no less eager to carry it out!

### Sum up
- Need for communication
- Tech workers
	- Sectarian use of "PMC"
- Events, events, events
- BHAM as a mushroom, sending comrades all over the place
- Sail metaphor

## JW's leadoff
- Mushroom metaphor
- Need for stalwart defense of Marxist philosophy
