# One-on-one with Jake Thorp
[[2022-04-26]]
#meeting/political

# ‚úÖ Topics to discuss
- [x] Chris posting unserious and "edgy" statements on Slack
- [x] [[What is Money? (2016)]]
	- [ ] What is money's role as a means of payment (distinct from account ledger role)?
	- [x] Why isn't a share of a corporation a share of ownership? see p.23
	- [x] Why does the article say that capital ownership becomes a share of social capital ownership, delivering the average rate of profit, if the stock market is divorced from economic reality? see p.24

# ‚úèÔ∏è Notes
- There's a political misunderstanding at the heart of Chris' comments on how homeowners are modern Kulaks. Housing shortages due to supply issues, not due to the sellers or owners themselves.
- He sees a certain impatience with Chris when it comes to the political situation. He thinks this should be watched carefully. 
- Starbucks interventions
	- The NYC branches have learned that slogans calling for revolutionary organization work well in these sorts of interventions. 
	- We shouldn't loose our heads about these interventions, and we shouldn't orient towards the activist layer that orbits these events. 
	- [[Communists must be honest]], we cannot ascribe real revolutionary potential to activist groups. 
- Consolidation
	- Chris mentioned a need for report-backs on one-on-ones, making sure nobody falls through the cracks in our branch. 
	- Jake thinks that it makes sense to assign Josh a one-on-one, and explain that he *is* growing politically, even if he doesn't think he is. 
	- Jake argues that either Freeman will develop in a direction towards or away from the [[IMT]]. [[Contradictions trend towards resolution]]. 
- BC meetings
	- He wants these to be regularized, but not necessarily frequent. 
	- A strong BC is the backbone of a strong branch. 
- Why isn't a share of a corporation a share of ownership? see p.23
	- It just isn't, I was incorrect. Big owners of shares exert infuence, since them dumping their shares would cause havoc for the company
- Why does the article say that capital ownership becomes a share of social capital ownership, delivering the average rate of profit, if the stock market is divorced from economic reality? see p.24
	- This is basically talking about the socialization and centralization of capital investment. The stock market may be distorted by government intervention, but it is still tied to the real economy and the real performance of companies.
