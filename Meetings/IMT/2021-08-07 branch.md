# Political discussion: Defend British Marxists from the Labour Party Purge [^1]
 [^1]: https://socialistrevolution.org/defend-british-marxists-from-the-labour-party-purge/

- My comments
	- Demonstrates fear of right wing of [[Labour Party (UK)]]
	- Comrades should center the political nature of this attack
	- Starmer has thrown down the gauntlet, we should pick it up
	- No shying away from conflict like the representatives of [[reformism]] do
	- Massive benefits from being seen as an anti-Starmer group
	- From IMT bulletin 31...
		- Dozens of membership applications withn a few days
		- A wave of publicity
		- Standing up and fighting, not retreating
	- How this relates to us
		- We should remember that as we grow, our enemies will no longer be able to ignore us
		- We are far from this in the [[USA]], but eventually we will be in a similar position as Socialist Appeal
