## Political Discussion - [workers democracy in the Russian Revolution](https://www.marxist.com/workers-democracy-in-the-russian-revolution-part-one.htm)
- This article discusses the achievements made in the October Revolution, as well as the struggles that emerged in the fight to finish the revolution.
- Bourgeois vs proletarian democracy
	- Bourgeois democracy prioritizes civil liberty above all others, believing that if the individual has some rights to vote then all other concerns are secondary
	- This form of democracy provides an excellent shell for capitalism because it allows monied interests to have more influence in the system while appearing legitimate
	- Workers democracy means the workers having not only voting rights, but the rights to really make the decisions that impact society and the way it's run
- The Paris Commune
	- This experience provided Marx a blueprint of how a proletarian revolution could come about
	- See [[The State and Revolution (1917)]] for a breakdown of the criteria that indicate a healthy proletarian revolution and the formation of a workers state. 

My intervention
- We can see where the material conditions for the Russian revolution fell short. Lenin talked about how it was much easier for the Revolution to begin in [[Russia]] than it would be to finish the revolution. 
- If the conditions for the establishment of socialism were present, there would be no need for the repressive measures that the Bolsheviks had to take just after their victory. Since the working class in Russia was so weak relative to the peasantry, and since the country was so weak relative to its neighbors, the Bolsheviks had to maintain an iron grip in order to prevent a backsliding into capitalism. 
- There's a reason that after the [[USA|American]] revolution there wasn't really a need to fight so hard to prevent monarchists from taking over again, and that's because the material conditions for capitalism existed in the US.
