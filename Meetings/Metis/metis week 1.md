During the first week of the bootcamp, we hit the ground running. We reviewed [[Pandas]], [[numpy]], and GitHub. Then, we started work on our first project, an explotartory data analysis of MTA turnstile data.

We recieved our project briefing on Monday, and by Friday our teams had to be ready to present our findings. 

During the week, we began an introduction to lots of topics, such as [[complexity]], [[pythonic style]], and the generalized [[data science workflow]]. 

Overall, it was quite hectic but we finished our project on time, finding that (shockingly) Grand Central Station and Penn Station have the highest volume of average daily traffic.
