# Notes from my Jan 14th career support meeting
`TAGS:` #meeting/career 

During [[metis week 2]], I decided to schedule a meeting with Jen, my [[career]] advisor.

## Questions I Had
- ESCI career prospects / domain knowledge for that field
- Choosing good project ideas for portfolio
- Job prospects for recent grads

## Answers I Got
- Plenty of people come in from undergrad
- The appeal is that I'm more junior with no bad habits
- I should cast a wide net
- I should keep my expectations open to a lot of things
- Networking is really important
- I should look for junior roles and internships
- The nice thing is that if I do well on the technical assesment then they will look past a short resume
- Titles are misleading and unreliable. Look at the work, not the title. 
- Domain experience isn't the end-all-be-all. Cast a wide net. 
- Projects
	- Employers can usually see past the surface and see what skills you have from a project. 
	- We should focus on business cases since I'm coming from more of an academia background. This shows that I know what business find valuable.
