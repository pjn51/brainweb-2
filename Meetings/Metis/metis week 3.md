This week, we had Monday off for MLK day. On Tuesday, we got some practice working with [[linear regression]], and talked about what kinds of assumptions linear regressions make about our data. On Wednesday, we kept practicing working with linear regressions, and got an introduction to [[stochastic]] [[gradient descent]]. 

Throughout the week, we all worked on our second projects, which we presented to the class on Friday.
