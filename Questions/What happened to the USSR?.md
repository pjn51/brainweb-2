# What happened to the USSR?
 [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]] after the October revolution in 1917. It's imperative that all [[Marxism|Marxists]] understand why and how this happened, so that we can convince the modern [[proletariat]] that [[socialism]] is a real possibility today. 

[[Trotsky always defended the USSR as a workers' state]], and he was right to. However, [[Workers' states are contradictory]] and contain both bourgeois and proletarian features at first. 

Because [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]], and the USSR was unable to create this basis during its formation, a bureaucratic clique ([[Was the Soviet bureaucracy a class?]]) was able to seize power. This was somewhat inevitable, since [[Social disengagement breeds bureaucratism]]. 

I think that [[The USSR wasn't bureaucratic collectivist]], and [[The USSR wasn't state capitalist]]. These theories fail to accept the progressive edge of the USSR's [[economic planning|planned economy]] and state ownership.
