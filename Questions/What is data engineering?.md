*What is data engineering?* Since [[We've entered a new age of data availability]], the process of processing, preparing, and delivering data is becoming more and more important. 

One definition is that data enginnering is the development and maintainance of systems that take in raw data and result in high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases [1]. In this way, [[Data engineering provides the foundation for data science]]. 

Like most tech fields, it's important to know the basics of [[data]] management.
