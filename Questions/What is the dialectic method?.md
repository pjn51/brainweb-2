# What is the dialectic method?
The [[dialectics|dialectic]] method is a big part of the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] (see [[What is dialectical materialism?]]). 

[[Dialectics are the 'higher mathematics' of logic]]. They deal with interactions, change, and transformation. A good starting point is the overview [[Engels]] gave: [[Engels breaks down the laws of dialectics into three principles]]. 

In order to arrive at this method, [[Marx inverted Hegel's dialectic]], placing it on a foundation of [[materialism]] instead of the [[idealism]] of [[Hegel]].
