# What is socialism?
[[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that [[socialism]] is the next-higher stage of societal development after [[capitalism]]. 

There is some ambiguity as to what [[Marx]] and [[Engels]] really meant by "socialism." They often refer to it interchangeably with "the lower stage of [[communism]]."There is also controversy about the relationship of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and socialism.
# [[What is the dictatorship of the proletariat and why is it needed?]]

Socialism is based on a system of central planning and workers' control of the means of production. This will massively raise the standard of living and the productivity of labor, because [[Planned economies outperform market systems]]. 

In order to facillitate workers' democracy, [[Socialism will increase leisure time]]. This is critical, and a failure to do this was a big reason that the [[The USSR became a degenerated workers' state]]. [[Socialism requires a high economic basis]].

- [[Rivalry has a place under socialism]]
