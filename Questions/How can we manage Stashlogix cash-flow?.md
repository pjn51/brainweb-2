# How can we manage Stashlogix cash-flow?
So far, this project has centered around automating the inventory management process. 

In order to answer this question, we should rely on standard business practices.
# [[How is cash flow managed?]]

The main thing we can improve right now is the process by which inventory is managed and POs are created. 
# [[How can we manage Stashlogix POs?]]

Ideally, we should be able to create a [[stash-o-matic loss function]] that can optimize for all the parameters we have.
