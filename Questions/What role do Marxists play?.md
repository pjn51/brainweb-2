*What role do Marxists play?* This is a huge question in my life, and it's a really important one for the workers' movement in general. I have carefully defined this question, since the role of the Marxists is different from the role of a revolutionary *party.* The difference is important. 
# [[What is a party?]]

[[Lenin]] had some ideas about this. [[Revolutionaries, to Lenin, must be tribunes of the people]]. 

Before Marxists can play any role, they have to organize themselves as a political force. 
# [[How should Marxists organize themselves?]]

Once Marxists are organized, we have to approach the partially formed workers' movement that will be rife with misconceptions and contradictory impulses. This work is essential, since [[Marxists orient towards the working class]] and [[The communists act as the historical memory of the working class]].
# [[How do Marxists approach oppression?]]
# [[How do Marxists approach workers' organizations?]]

The ultimate aim of Marxists is to be the midwives of revolution. 
# [[What is a revolution?]]
