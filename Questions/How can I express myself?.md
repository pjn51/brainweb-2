# How can I express myself?
I want to be able to express my personality, creativity, and ideas somehow. I have trouble opening up to others, and I think this would be a good way to do that. 

So far, I've tried to draw and pursue other visual arts, but nothing has really clicked for me. I sometimes wonder if creative writing would be an interesting thing for me to pursue. I've started writing about the [[People of Harvard Ave]] as a way to play with this kind of writing.
