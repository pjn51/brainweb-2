*What is Marxist economic theory?* Fundamentally, the core of Marxist economic analysis is an application of [[dialectical materialism]] to the sphere of social relations. 

For a [[Marxism|Marxist]], there is no moat between the social, the economic, and the political. [[Culture is downstream from economic basis]]. All inform and act upon one another, such that the economic analysis of Marxism contains an analysis of history, culture, ideology, and more within it. 

Turning to the explicitly economic, Marxist economics relies on the [[labor theory of value]] (See [[What is the labor theory of value?]]). 

Marx also said that [[The rate of profit tends to fall]] due to competition under [[capitalism]]. He said that this exerted a downward force on wages, and that [[The price of labor power tends towards the cost of reproduction of the worker]].
