# How should I organize my knowledge?
I'm fascinated by the world of [[PKM]] and the goal of maximizing my understanding of the world. 

The current state of my PKM workflow: A modification of the [[zettelkasten method]] focusing on questions as natural organizers of knowledge. 

This leads us to a few other questions: 
# [[How should my index be organized?]]
# [[How can I effectively organize technical info?]] 
# [[How should I treat others' ideas in my notes?]]
