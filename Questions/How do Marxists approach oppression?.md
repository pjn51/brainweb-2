# How do Marxists approach oppression?
This is a very important question, because [[Racism has divided the working class]] and weakened its ability to think and fight for itself. 

However, [[Identity politics have limited revolutionary potential]] and [[The priviledge narriative isn't revolutionary]]. 

[[Bolshevism has a similarity to improv]]. Marxists must explain to the working class that [[White workers don't benefit from racism]], as it only serves to divide them against themselves. Instead, we must explain that [[Working class unity is the responsibility of the least oppressed]], and it is the job of white workers to reach out a hand to the other sections of the class, and fight in their interests. [[Workers have natural solidarity]]. We can develop this solidarity through fighting for our shared interests as workers, including the extermination of racial prejudice among our ranks as workers.
