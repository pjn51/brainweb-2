# What is the general data science workflow?
There are five fundamental steps to this workflow. 
1. Question development
2. Data wrangling and exploratory analysis
3. Modeling
4. Communication and deployment

## 1
First, we must start with good [[project questions]]. Keep in mind that we should always [[Begin projects with a use-case]]. This is very important for the later modeling step, since [[ML approaches are question-specific]]. 

## 2
Then we can move on to [[data wrangling]]. This is important, because [[ML can't overcome bad data]]. 
# [[What are best practices for data cleaning?]]

## 3
After the data is clean, we can do some [[exploratory data analysis]]. 

## 4
Next step is modeling, which comes with various challenges and choices to make. 
# [[How can we select the best ML model?]]

Once we've started modeling, we are going to encounter some problems that need to be addressed:
# [[How can we combat overfitting?]]
# [[How can we combat underfitting?]]

## 5
After modeling, we must enter the phase of [[communication and deployment]]. This should be the use-case that we started our project with. 

The [[data science]] workflow is not linear. We can go from step one to two, back to one if need be. Overall, remember that [[Complexity must be justified]].
