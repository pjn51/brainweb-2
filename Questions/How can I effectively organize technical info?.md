# How can I effectively organize technical info?
I was thinking about how I turn to my vault more for conceptual ideas rather than technical information. I often rely on my collected ideas when thinking about concepts related to philosophy, politics, and history, but I tend to turn to external sources of information when it comes to python and math. Why is that? Is there a better way for me to format my knowledge of technical fields?

I think that [[Ideas are more important to record than facts]], and maybe this is the heart of the issue. I never tend to look back on these facts, so maybe I should just stick to ideas. 

In terms of programming, which is the bulk of my technical notes, I should remember that [[Coding isn't about memorization]]. Some people argue that we should not take notes about coding at all [1]. Since [[Action verifies perception]], we should learn by doing.
