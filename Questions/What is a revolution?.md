# What is a revolution?
Because of the development of the methods of production, the economic base of society begins to contradict the superstructure (see [[The dialectic of base and superstructure]]). [[Revolutions re-align base and superstructure]], allowing for human society to proceed on a higher level. 

These [[Revolutions follow a molecular process]], beginning invisbly but eventually [[Quantity transforms into quality]] and the events become faster and more intense. Eventually [[Revolutions reflect seismic consciousness shifts]] as the masses recognize the fact that the superstructure is holding the whole of society back. 

In strategic terms...
