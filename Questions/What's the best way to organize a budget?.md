# What's the best way to organize a budget?
In my opinion, [[Some things work better in a physical format]]. There's a grounding effect from manually putting in your expenses line by line, day by day. It forces you to actually sit there and type out all the things that you spent money on during the month, and as a result it automatically gives you an instinctive understanding of where your money's going. Of course, this is less convinient than automated software, but for me the tradeoff is worth it. 

In general, I need to [[Build scaffolding, not cages]]. I want a budget sheet to be flexible above all else. The methods that I've tried in the past are a little too rigid, and that's a fundamental issue with Google Sheets. [[All classification is approximation]], meaning that sometimes I get classifications wrong. It's very hard to create new categories or split existing categories in rigid systems, because I have to go back and manually divide the transactions up one at a time. 

I really want to create a system that...

- Helps me to think about how I'm spending money
- Allows me to set targets for myself
- Allows me to recategorize expenses on the fly
- Put in expenses very quickly
- Only have justified complexity ([[Complexity must be justified]])

In a certain way, I'm dealing with an issue that I've seen before. In general, [[Emergent associations beat predetermined categorization]], and this is a great example of that. I think that I'm dividing up my spending into useful categories, but then I find that one category is much too broad, but I'm unable to easily divide that category into its component parts. 

The real issue here is one of information loss. When I'm manually putting line items into my budget, I want to include as little information as possible. However, when I'm reviewing the data, the lack of information limits me. That's the fundamental contradiction here.
