*Should I organize by question rather than topic?* This is an extension of the question: [[How should my index be organized?]]

There are some good reasons for doing this. I think we should [[Organize information for retrieval]], and a topic-organization doesn't really do that at all. 

By centering questions, I would have lots of natural and overlapping diving-in points to the network, and these diving-in points would act as natural organizers of interesting topics that would be easy to synthesize into essays, articles, etc. 

I think I'm going to go ahead and do this, but keep it separate from my [[thought cabinet]] so that I can return to topic-organization if I want to in the future. 

The new format will be called [[question index]]
