# How can we manage common resources?
Usually, the narriative is that of [[Hardin's tragedy of the commons]], and the prescription is one of either privatization or central coercion by a [[Hobbes]]-esque "Levithian." However, Ostrom provides an analysis that subverts this idea in [[Governing the Commons (1990)]]. Tragedies of the commons exist in a historical context, and in fact, [[Capitalism generates tragedies of the commons]]. 

[[Ostrom calls "Levithian or privatization" a false dichotomy]], and highlights alternative models of CPR maintainance. 

In general, we can see that [[Sustainability requires self-government]], something antithetical to [[capitalism]].
