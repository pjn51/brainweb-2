*How does the internet work?* As somebody in a technical field, it's important for me to know the basics of how this network actually functions. 

[[The internet is decentralized]], spread out among various data centers and redundant cables that connect place to place. It relies on data centers that store data and host applications, and its backbone is the long-distance fiber-optic cables owned by internet service providers. ISPs also own the cables and wireless towers that connect users to the internet. [[The internet began as a military program]], and the backbone of the internet was privatized as late as 1994.

[[Computers interface with the internet via their protocol stack]]. 

In order for communications to take place on the interent, we need to keep various forms of data confidential.
