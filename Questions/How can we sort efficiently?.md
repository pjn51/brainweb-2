# How can we sort efficiently?
In computer science, the task of sorting large amounts of [[data]] is central. We can grade different methods based on their [[complexity]], measured with Big O. [[Big O notation relates input size to run time]]. 

The [[selection sort]] is a basic method. The [[merge sort]] is more efficient. In fact, [[Merge sort is the most efficient sorting method]], and we can say that [[Sorting costs n times log(n)]].
