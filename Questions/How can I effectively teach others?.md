*How can I effectively teach others?* As a [[Marxism|Marxist]], it's my role to help those around me learn about various ideas related to political economy and revolutionary theory in order to build [[cadre]], since [[Marxist leadership cannot be improvised]]. These ideas tend to be hard to understand at first, especially since the pervading philosophy of our era is totally counter to [[dialectical materialism]].

I know that [[Interactive learning beats lecture]]. I also know that [[In order to make progress, you have to fail]]. Therefore, it seems like I should strongly prefer a well-rounded discussion to a long monologue when trying to conduct political education. That way, people have the opportunity to apply the abstractions that I'm providing and see how they can do. 

[[Cognition consists of movement between the abstract and the concrete]]. Maybe the best way to teach the Marxist method is to have people conduct this kind of analysis and help them along with it. 

On the other hand, the purpose of giving leadoffs is also to train the *speaker* on how to communicate to an audience effectively. Maybe this is why we place such an emphasis on conducting educational work outside of branch, such as reading groups and one-on-ones.
