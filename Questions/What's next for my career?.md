*What's next for my career?* I have a choice to make. Now that I'm gainfully employed at [[Atos]], I have more options than before. 

First of all, [[What's the best way to find a job?]]

One path leads towards [[data science]]. This one is probably the most interesting and highest paying. Another path leads towards [[data engineering]]. This takes advantage of a lot of my skills. The third path leads towards software development/engineering. 
# [[What do data scientists need to know?]]
# [[What do data engineers need to know?]]
# [[What do backend developers need to know?]] 

The deciding factors will be salary, advancement opportunities, and demand for these roles now and into the future. 

All three of these options rely in some way on my [[stash-o-matic project]] since my job at [[Atos]] isn't exactly building my resume.
