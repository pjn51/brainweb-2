# How should Marxists organize themselves?
Without a capable organization, the forces of [[Marxism]] don't have a chance of providing aid to the struggle of the workers.

Marxists organize themselves in [[cadre]] organizations, and should seek to avoid [[sectarianism]] and [[ultraleftism]]. 
# [[What is a cadre?]]
# [[What makes an organization sectarian?]]

[[Lenin argued for revolutionary professionalism]]

[[Lenin]] argues that professionalized agitation is essential so that the Marxists can win the leadership of the masses when the time comes ([[What is to be Done (1902)]], p 181). The method that Lenin and others expound is [[democratic centralism]]. 

However, since [[Revolutionary parties tend to emerge from splits in existing mass organizations]], in the meantime Marxists cannot declare the creation of the revolutionary party. For example, [[The IMT considers itself a tendency rather than a party]]. 

As a Marxist, I have to apply these lessons to my own branch in the [[IMT]]. 
# [[How can I nurture the branch?]]
# [[How can I effectively teach others?]]
