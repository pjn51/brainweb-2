# What is fascism?
[[Fascism]] is a counter-revolutionary movement that bases itself on the [[petty bourgeoisie]], the [[peasantry]], and funding from the [[bourgeoisie]]. 

[[Trotsky]] explains that when presented with the dilemma of imminent revolution, the bourgeoisie begins to desperately search for a way out after exausting its usual tools of the [[labor aristocracy]] and the [[state]]. The capitalists become open to the idea of a fascist demagogue, even though [[Capitalists prefer liberal democracy]] generally. On the other hand, the fascist movement draws strength from the petty bourgeoisie's exaustion and need to end the crisis, which the revolutionary situation represents. When these two currents combine, a fascist movement is born [1].
