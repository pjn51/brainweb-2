# Was the Soviet bureaucracy a class?
This is a critical question, because it determines the class character of the [[Russia|Soviet]] state in general. 

One one hand, [[Trotsky didn't define the Soviet bureaucracy as a class]] and he was firm on this position. However, I don't find his argument definitive. He thinks that there was no historical need for a bureaucracy in the USSR, and therefore, the bureaucracy represented a cancerous growth. 

I think you could make the argument that there *was* a historical need for a bureaucracy in the USSR, based on the specific conditions of the time and place. 

The real arguement here is whether or not the role played by the bureaucracy was necessary for production, because [[Classes arise due to the needs of production]].
