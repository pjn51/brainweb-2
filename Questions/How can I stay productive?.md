# How can I stay productive?
I need to manage my productivity for multiple areas of my life. Of course, a job requires productivity, but I also enjoy producing notes, manuscripts, and new ideas through [[PKM]], and I am a productive member of my branch in the [[IMT]]. 

[[Good productivity routines allows for flow]] so that the work can seem effortless and is engaging on a deep level. 

Since [[Volition is a finite resource]], [[Willpower is a bad foundation for productivity]] since you can't really count on it always being there. It's better to focus on building habits so that less and less volition is required for maintanance.
