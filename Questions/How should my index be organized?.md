# How should my index be organized?
I'm feeling constrained by a single note that has *all* my idea notes in it. Should I add a little more complexity to this system? I want to be really careful about that, since in general, [[Complexity must be justified]]. 

I also want to [[Build scaffolding, not cages]] when it comes to my [[PKM]] system. 

I've moved on from having a hard-coded categorization system for my index. I just don't think this is going to scale well, and it always takes a long time to reprogram when my categories change. 

Using `dataviewjs`, there seems to be a possibility of setting things up in the way that I want. The current code implementation can be found in my [[thought cabinet]].

After reading an argument that we should [[Organize information for retrieval]], I'm thinking of redesigning my index. Perhaps I should strongly center questions as the retrieval point for ideas. That would be really convinent when I want to dive into a certain topic, without being restrictive. However, would that aid in my ability to connect notes to existing ideas?
