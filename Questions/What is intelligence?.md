# What is intelligence?
I think this is a question that applies to human [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and the field of AI and [[machine learning]]. 

Approaching this question, it's important to remember that [[Thought and activity are inseperable]]. We are intelligent not for its own ends, but as a means to manipulate the world. 

I guess we could define human intelligence as the speed and clarity of one's cognitive process.
# [[How does cognition work?]]

For machines, it can be harder to quantify this, since computers tend to be really good at very specific things, but tend to lack generalized abilities. For example, [[Math works in n-dimensions]] unlike humans.
