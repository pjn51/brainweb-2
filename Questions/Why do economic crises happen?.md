# Why do economic crises happen?
Under [[capitalism]], we see a cycle of expansion and crisis that has repeated consistently since the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] revolutions. This demonstrates that [[Capitalism cannot escape crisis]]. 

One reason for this is that [[Overproduction is fundamental to capitalism]] and results in an over-abundance of [[commodities]]. Once capitalists can no longer sell their commodities, they must fire workers and destroy means of production until the forces of supply and demand can be reconciled. 

However, [[Capitalism has no final crisis]] and will never die without being killed. Furthermore, [[Credit delays economic crisis]].
