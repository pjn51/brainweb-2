# What causes Crohn's?
[[Crohn's isn't an autoimmune disease]]. Instead, the real trigger is unclear. But it's definitley related the immune system somehow. However, some have theorized that it represents an immunodeficiency state. 

[[Crohn's is associated with genetic factors]]. 


Some theorize that those with Crohn's lacked exposure to parasites or benficial microbes that tend to coexist with our immune system, or were perhaps exposed to harmful parasites or microbes. 

[[Crohn's is associated with environmental factors]].
