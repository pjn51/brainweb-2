*Who controls the internet?* While [[The internet began as a military program]], it was fully privatized in the 90s. Since then, it has been run as a nominally decentralized network of voluntary connection agreements between thousands of networks, ones hosted by various universities and firms. 

However, there *are* some central governing bodies regarding the internet. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit that distributes domain names and IP addresses. 

There is also a group that sents shared technical standards, called the Internet Engineering Task Force. This organization does not compel adherence, but it represents the consensus of the ISP community. 

While the internet is nominally independent of the [[state]], in reality the state often intervenes to limit or outright cease online communication during times of unrest. In [[Egypt]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Kazakhstan]] we've seen recent examples of the state intervening dramatically in online networks.
